Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I always put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
that has made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambig@@ uous .
&quot; I will always put in drawers or put up from the outside label , who with me and the reality usually have little to do . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the desire , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , these things are rather sn@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at that as &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the actress spends her time at home , a m TV with loose Dut@@ t and Mexican food , is called in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; to the white gl@@ ut , they bring the question of the children &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; we women have to be married or have children to be completely &quot; , &quot; the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a Children &apos;s Play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as an all @-@ one mother to see two sons .
the film runs from August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a Golf@@ tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sear@@ ched with some colleagues a bit of variety with a horseback riding on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses reminded of their celebrations , they unted in the fast Gal@@ op@@ p home to the for@@ age . &quot;
&quot; a few kilometers at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and with it the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday she was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament - again near horses .
&quot; he left himself with his family via the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse sw@@ allowed himself to be pic@@ tured . &quot;
a long was the first time in Aachen and with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe over@@ looked the man from An@@ hausen within the framework of a small g@@ ala @-@ pyram@@ idal pyramid .
at the awards it is not a li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; Bundes@@ liga , Silver and Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already started him .
&quot; long , the 18th lau@@ re@@ ate of the Sport@@ pyramid . &quot;
&quot; at Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means to me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
&quot; and so , he also gave the money fee of 25.000 Euro once more . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ class master@@ pieces was recorded at the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the athle@@ ath@@ l@@ eten Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the Ru@@ ff Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the No@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the No@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the No@@ do@@ ka Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the palms of all Erhard . &quot;
&quot; many of these sports@@ men were born on Saturday , Germany . &quot;
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative company was wander@@ ing into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza price ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
cl@@ int@@ ons and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policies compared to : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the TT@@ P - they want to both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; one of them are the two US presidential , however , in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ns how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
&quot; Clinton wants to put the economy to death , and regulated to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he would be quite different , maintains Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely drive regul@@ ators , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfill , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and need money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; to be invested in the nuts , Tru@@ mp and Clinton almost wor@@ ding . &quot;
the democratic evaluation in An@@ no@@ un@@ ces had the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are rejected by the state of state Te@@ ach@@ y wings of Republi@@ cans .
&quot; therefore , in Tru@@ mp , you could send another cross @-@ party discussions . &quot;
clearly the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to rebuild carbon@@ ic power stations and again increase coal reduction in the US .
oil development should also be possible in so far protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; Clinton in contrast , Clinton wants to expand their investment programme explicitly and asks : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two ri@@ vals are not too far away . &quot;
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but just to protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; those are to be paid even better , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger pay .
it wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp will do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
&quot; however , the great discussion of the coming months might likely be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand is Tru@@ mp , who wants to stimulate the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics are holding it before , so that the fiscal deficit would only be even bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton stands at least from the rich that they pay more taxes and say their critics : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women , who alone fl@@ ee , almost already in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; if they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed . &quot;
a house offers refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen sit four women .
&quot; each has a baby , which is at the most one year old . &quot;
one has laid their little son in his arm .
he was curious with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother rigi@@ dly on the top @-@ plate .
until they noticed that it is observed .
it sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria , and is dealing among other things with the topic women on the flight . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in Mün@@ ch@@ ner North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - even as visitors .
the exception is an Wach@@ mann in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here , has done on their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men fl@@ ee because of wars , because they are politically pursued because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as a hope to join Europe . &quot;
&quot; for women over@@ weigh other reasons for escape , &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , hon@@ orary mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here , all women in refugees would often be regarded as inf@@ eri@@ or and har@@ dest . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in the North in Mün@@ ch@@ ner north , it is estimated that it is estimated . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not optional . &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not help to help , there are more accommodations only for them , asks B@@ ahr . &quot;
in Bavaria the seven districts rule for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; on the question whether from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , please answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is such a thing in the governments of the governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Sw@@ ab@@ ians alone , women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher by the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken can be found in some communal locations or homes only for women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is ra@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study that was released for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are being separated . &quot;
&quot; if privacy or are lod@@ ged together , men and women are being accommod@@ ated together , it may come to - continuous - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the washing rooms should be easily accessible and accessible to women in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this protective field , it is possible to see the in@@ ges@@ tion that gives it to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long queue , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily get a second house .
assistance strikes : demands for new labour @-@ actions
&quot; &quot; &quot; the assistance of assistance in assistance have called their union to be called new labour @-@ actions for any dispute regarding a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded his entire Council , starting from the beginning of September more labor measures . &quot;
&quot; the J@@ DC said that there would be a minister , to respond to the concerns relating to the contract . &quot;
Assi@@ stance and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract in July on the rejection of a contract with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted for the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was released on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said the government &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , which led the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; given the J@@ DC executive committee to reject the proposed new contract completely reject and official re @-@ talks to all E@@ uren concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC committee has provided a formal application for a specific meeting of BM@@ A Council to start a continuous programme of escal@@ ating labour policy , which begins in early September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to that Assi@@ stance in the year six@@ teen strikes , the first overall waste in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the manager of the BM@@ A Assi@@ stance in Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came to the election of the agreed contract conditions , which were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which was still pre @-@ determined before the vote by 54.@@ 000 Assi@@ stance and media students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forced to be in part . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Allianz of aliens &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and proclaimed a official end of the eight months long lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes its Turkish counter@@ players in the se@@ ated hall of the St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I can &apos;t forget the expression that Ankara wants to win this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile pro@@ cked , and he has little heat off , even for its backward relationships . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , he repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report full of five times . &quot;
I could no longer count it .
&quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even further improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan had heard so that Erdo@@ gan would have heard , as if there was never anything worse . &quot;
me seemed like his enthusiasm to indicate the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin ex@@ radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that the state of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory mat@@ ing : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was awake .
&quot; Putin shared and accused Ankara , Russia fell into his back . &quot;
leaving was even bigger because it was committed by a good friend .
Vet@@ r@@ ust can rebuild again is difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; months long , the state controlled media led a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed to be the door for everything to blame . &quot;
&quot; on the most serious officers , the accus@@ ations were benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which could be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this veh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg was the official message , that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a c@@ eas@@ ef@@ ire must be clearly stated on hand .
Erdo@@ gan is needed primarily all friends who can get it after his last month at a failed state almost his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also sh@@ aken it too .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have made Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is gone by nearly 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated , if the flights are recorded . &quot;
you count on a delay in the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week progn@@ os@@ ed the state , cheap fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imported . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulate it : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry in the West since it &apos;s reaction to the tried to take power over the weak response .
&quot; to do this , the continued Gro@@ ll come across the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the black@@ out , out of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
Russian heads in Ankara won a bonus that he called for the attempted state of support for the elected state organs .
&quot; this is well @-@ toler@@ ated for Moscow , a self @-@ understanding that even has a deep @-@ sitting fear of rain . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace at the sea allowed it Russia and Turkey , one which once seemed to present me an analy@@ tic &quot; &quot; alliance of aliens &quot; &quot; : two countries who encounter themselves from the West and are now being treated badly and now . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are differences between the two still great differences . &quot;
&quot; the largest difference in Syria , where Moscow has recently been the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers &quot; , &quot; but where Russia and Turkey are opposing views . &quot;
&quot; it might be reve@@ aling that after almost three hours of initial discussions , both of the pres@@ idents spoke at the press conference that they could not even shed the issue . &quot;
&quot; the president of Turkey rent it clear to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disco@@ aster , as NATO member , Turkey , the Russian Kamp@@ fj@@ et - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State were at least again talking to one another . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland not available for customers outside Scotland outside Scotland
&quot; according to the R@@ BS brand , the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ office loud on a back@@ office . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand were associated with global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has changed since then she had almost collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; in this period , brand@@ ed &quot; R@@ BS &quot; is used to protect other end @-@ consumers brands . &quot;
&quot; they supported the international sport with millions of pounds to Sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to the Wim@@ bl@@ edon winner Andy Murray . &quot;
but now it has decided to put more national brands into the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but it is not initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the central headquarters and the IP@@ O have to switch to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the retail store that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be employed at our Invest@@ ors as well as the brand , among which our employees are busy , as we now become a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these marks will be at their own congreg@@ ations for something completely different , and our employees will work among these brands with the customers . &quot;
&quot; R@@ BS has already said that his Six Nations sponsorship will no longer be continued , and that it will increase the perc@@ ability of the various brands in his sport sponsorship . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , for how do we concentrate on inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the board . &quot;
three years ago it had been very cy@@ ni@@ fied three years ago when we were told that we would have to be a great bank for our customers and these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , think I will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can back these brands again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieved on pre@@ dil@@ ection to its 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spr@@ inkl@@ ing champagne , after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win &quot;
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori recorded his 3.@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market .
&quot; he set on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year Itali@@ ans is the sixth Jo@@ ckey who reached the milestone in the flat @-@ run .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ term winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who was previously on G@@ hay@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; It is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; I am very happy that it &apos;s done with New@@ market , because I walked here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers , when he gets the victory for Pre@@ dil@@ ection . &quot;
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the Hinder@@ er race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ painting winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4.@@ 300 victories in a recru@@ iting career .
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Kar@@ rier@@ esi@@ ans &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of the modern and it is not a surprise that he has reached this milestone just a few in front of him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that differs from the other in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma fans for this sport for years now . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already picked 6,000 profits if he was not just a Week@@ end@@ - and Groß@@ tur@@ ni@@ jo@@ ckey would be ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already suffered for nearly 30 years of winners in the UK .
&quot; he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a brilliant race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ mo@@ unts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British Flach@@ au . &quot;
it was ner@@ able .
&quot; a whole series of big farms , including its famous &quot; Gl@@ or@@ rich Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had difficulties , when he returned from his sixth century , but he showed an impressive character@@ ful strength to def@@ ends its branches and to return to its continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori previously said , that he wants to continue with competitions until he wants to continue at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years . &quot;
Russia Putin mo@@ ist Stab@@ ur@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian president Vladimir Putin has released an anticipated its stick @-@ ef Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years in the narro@@ west of trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as an amb@@ assador for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has arranged without giving reasons the dismis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidency . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been appointed to his successor since 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 1972 was born in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tallinn , he made his degree at the Prime Minister of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) , that he later was later the chief manager and staff managers of the government . &quot;
&quot; about his appointment , he said to Putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state , and to support control of your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and was recommended to v@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling Faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was for a long time of one of the closest to Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , the two men said that the St@@ ef on his own request comes back . &quot;
&quot; but despite the lungs for the cameras , here are only few of it - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is here the consequence of a kind of power competition ?
this currently knows no one .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man who was once known as a potential President , who wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across big scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments on Putin , who c@@ ited on the website of the Krem@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov , &quot; said Ivan@@ ov &quot; &quot; it is true that I have asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation I could almost say - compl@@ ained post four years long . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been the president of the Russian Pres@@ idential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin has been Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who was appointed the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his substitute . &quot;
&quot; as Putin , he called his power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , he most familiar . &quot;
&quot; once was believed in Ivan@@ ov &apos;s second term president of Russia , as a third term coup would have lost Putin against the constitution . &quot;

Queens@@ ferry ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 billion US project should be completed by May 2017
&quot; engineers have linked the Nord@@ deck of the que@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct , meaning that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is the first of four con@@ cluding the &quot; &quot; cover @-@ blo@@ wer &quot; &quot; that approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 ton .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 screws . &quot;
the £ 1,35 billion project should be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; economic Minister Keit@@ h Brown has taken a visit today and was one of the first , which went from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of a leading art of engineering in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel which alone were used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the br@@ ück@@ ende@@ ck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , nearly 79 % of the entire Br@@ ück@@ ende@@ ck in their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets a Bet@@ ong@@ uss for the Deck , which means that the whole Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in each section project . &quot;
with this fantastic project the cl@@ asp is to be tr@@ end@@ setting and low @-@ setting .
&quot; after installing the last street section and its connection with the northern side of the northern deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by drag@@ ging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ a@@ du@@ kt 222 meters long is , approximately 6,000 tons weighs and at a slope of approx . 3 % to the top . &quot;
&quot; heating , as the toler@@ ances , which the team works , tiny , and on each side they rose only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .

&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
this alar@@ ming as a result of his sister .
&quot; together with their lives , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .

who builds a cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green mean : investors should be much stronger in the future in future .
how does one react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , arguments is program@@ m@@ able . &quot;
first and foremost it is about the question : who is supposed to build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD @-@ president Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in future , 20 percent of all apartments must be exhibiting as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be developed in stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the large dispute point in the city hall is , however Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you go to investors who want to build on private spaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such a surface at least 10 percent , but as best as 20 percent of the apartments are building as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban residential construction program , which will cost millions of cost and is still being financed to provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left still wants tough@@ ness to investors .
&quot; regardless of its , so Brat@@ mann , has a tight@@ ening of the situation on the residential market . &quot;
&quot; the action concept is implemented , this will provide for additional tasks in the construction administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
&quot; the program is not yet entirely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you like the loss of further about 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose promotion will be run in the coming years ? &quot;
it will be 500 apartments alone by 2020 .
&quot; to prevent this , as the planning @-@ policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought from the city now . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would also have to be thought to pick up apartments back into the price list . &quot;
this is possible in the west city .
one fell sw@@ allow the problem to solve this problem .
because in the west city run the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price of cheap apartments there .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; for example , the number of social housing in the Western city has dramatically increased dramatically , you get away from the target of the so @-@ called circulation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbour@@ hoods will no longer be able to give . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a wide majority must enter the CD@@ U with the boat . &quot;
&quot; indeed , this has concentrated on more places for family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
&quot; Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile . &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
&quot; that teen@@ ager and child for playing no longer go out , but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens on screens , has been lam@@ ented in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Po@@ k@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about to pick people from the sofa and let more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then limited to video games and finally on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ w@@ ahn , an app that were built on the characters , first created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ s ( later resulting from a drawing series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of the Pop@@ culture , the interest from the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand decreased in early July . &quot;
the launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
&quot; within a few days , Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon will have more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphones in the outside and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons who were tr@@ acked with a GPS once they were once found &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; ( over a screens@@ hot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured . &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , closed the w@@ ahn and sp@@ rang for the search from the couch . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person will leave every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ og@@ ram , an app for Apple Watch , the 35.@@ 000 users recently re@@ trac@@ ed that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of persec@@ uted people , which train every day 30 minutes , by 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company does not know who plays that Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data for performance enhancement .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 Min@@ utes &quot; to &quot; &quot; from the couch &quot; and &quot; every day to be active in do@@ ve ears , because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look like . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport drives , reduces his chances to kill cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that too long is to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonder@@ full of Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , that they are fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ ür@@ ur@@ ry game , who have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is supposed to be ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps such as Fit@@ Bit have already been able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to exercise sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will be loaded with time .
&quot; however , due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , however , there will be more games to combine the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will assist many people in the hunt , active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the D@@ ament@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .

Simone Bil@@ es is on all the imm@@ un .
dynam@@ ically to the ski @-@ horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on gan@@ zer line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ ans .
the 19 @-@ year American tur@@ tle in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
her total output of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly in front of the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ er@@ kam@@ adin A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze by Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the Americ@@ an@@ ists of Simone Bil@@ es , on the Swedish , during the single multi @-@ competition during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , which wins a multi @-@ battle title and the fifth , while she captiv@@ ated its reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; it broke out in tears , when its end result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment . &quot;
&quot; this success presents them in the same League as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , which have brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years their sport - including 10 gold medals - including so amazing exercises , which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress from 1984 Mary Lou rescue on from her said that she is &quot; the best tur@@ tle in which I ever seen . &quot;
&quot; they expected to have a last test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between the Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas return , would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americ@@ an@@ ists Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace their gold and silver in the single multi @-@ rise of women in the art summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es put the first medal on Tuesday , while on the far@@ ewell party who retired in his retirement team coordinates in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a foreig@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; although it existed on its long way , during their long way to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of its natural exercises - which contain its typical tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music which would fit at home outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
it is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by coach A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ ing in the gymn@@ asium , was trained in the boats . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2013 it has not lost a multi @-@ war competition , a winning series that will keep as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina was slightly led , dec@@ eased the image . &quot;
sul@@ try and Bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es stops the World Cup - lau@@ ded .
they came back with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the float again - and sat with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground still one .
&quot; re@@ ais@@ le her im@@ pover@@ ished her as her En@@ der@@ g@@ it@@ ary - a pure form@@ ality - and tears away on Bil@@ es sh@@ iny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once was described in their collection @-@ book , to reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of R@@ ais@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when she fought the third place , but the bronze aille in a Ti@@ eb@@ r@@ ake on Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year team leaders had been called &quot; &quot; gran@@ ny &quot; &quot; by the Americans . &quot;
&quot; after their soil I cast it to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ es , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which was sometimes dubi@@ ous . &quot;

police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ers during the musician in the car
&quot; according to the police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 years old girl were shot in one of the deadly attacks since a decade in the first series of Phoenix during a decade while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked when the car was par@@ ked . &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator mo@@ ist eight shots from a handful of fire while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled along with another vehicle is to read in the report .
&quot; the police shared with that the triple murder not seems to be the result of a boot@@ y , since the att@@ acker could not have the palms or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who took care of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting at the investigation to become a closer look , whether they are connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; overall , primarily in h@@ is@@ panic living dwell@@ ings were killed in nine months in nine attacks seven people and two more in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , divided Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects several vehicles has used , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ ll@@ ac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refuse to off@@ end the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .

a witness to the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which turned on an empty pick@@ up truck for half an hour before the triple murder and from that it is assumed that it was the work of the series production . &quot;

mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his aging enjoyed Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto didn &apos;t know anything . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought I was not . &quot;
I did not make this .
I didn &apos;t let me be left .
&quot; what isn &apos;t right at all -- of course , one has left it on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund was never able to recognize them under circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ote him to institutional .
&quot; my first response to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; stated Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ kers .
Ed@@ mund was neither sitting until his third year &apos;s birth and he can still not speak .
but he slowly is making progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the character language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something ahead . &quot;
&quot; we bring him character language at , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as Mas@@ ern or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
&quot; it is still too early to say , how to influence the life of having been influenced with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus . &quot;
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of a certain future .
&quot; I asked constantly , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t been asked for a long time after the progn@@ osis because I am not expecting to tell me someone really .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has caused a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects that were caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it is better .
you know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical state ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
&quot; the boy was built on the front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is found in a critical state , reported on the sender . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police have just identified whether one of the most recent men of the perpet@@ r@@ ator might be .

&quot; Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for Stur@@ m@@ ite , who were trac@@ ed to a different storm , over@@ hau@@ led the scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a long @-@ lasting battle .

&quot; in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active involved in the police @-@ man Anthony of Gin@@ al@@ di of police in Philadelphia . &quot;

on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year girl got hit by a cross @-@ r@@ ack@@ et at the arm when she played before her house in the residential area of the West O@@ ak Lane .
she recovered and the police is still looking for a susp@@ ects .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie need
&quot; this is what I present to me under the Frauen@@ oly@@ mp@@ i@@ am@@ ann@@ ah , and that for more than one reason . &quot;
&quot; first , I have been at every summer Olymp@@ ics since 1984 and the US had never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three tur@@ ers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez that inspir@@ es for many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jü@@ din , and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ kin is , makes every proud . &quot;
this team is finally reflected in the USA .
it has been the black and h@@ is@@ pan female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was among the female Tur@@ ner@@ ers an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americ@@ anism .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising h@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner and the Americas che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now , the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , such as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone was the fourth , heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American who won at an individual multi @-@ event event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but we do not see you in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie take all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will have only four tur@@ ret inside the crew . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that exercising a expensive sport is and Tur@@ ner will be maintained primarily in private trainers who pay for training , furnishings , travel - clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be repeated as you like . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ around are in af@@ flu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
in these associations the Tur@@ ner receive her whole training and that is a expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ er of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ er by Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the exercising . &quot;
&quot; we have to get inspired the municipalities of countless , young girls , which are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie . &quot;
I have founded my gymn@@ stiftung of 20 years .
&quot; in my event , we have offered free and affordable turbul@@ ent in Harlem for more than 15.000 ur@@ bane youths ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ian ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics who deserve the opportunity to learn from this great oly@@ mp@@ ic sport . &quot;
&quot; exercise develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for educational and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to be interesting for the exercising , and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this true presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team and thanks , F@@ ass you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance supplements would like to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y H@@ unts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes caused by adop@@ ting a reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ alities of British Medical Association , but 58 percent of 37.@@ 000 Assi@@ di@@ aries , who voted against him at a choice . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt have revealed plans to introduce the contract forces and said that N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; &quot; ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients were harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance systems should receive a new contract , the changes to night@@ - and week@@ days , to improve the maintenance of this time . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ sten@@ ik divided last night in a communication with : &quot; Assi@@ sten@@ dic@@ aries agreed to the proposed contract in particular , especially that it will treat the current availability crisis and administ@@ ered all doctors to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; at only eight weeks , who still remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , have to be made progress and time is running out . &quot;
efforts on the part of BM@@ A to solve any dispute with the government to take part in the rel@@ uc@@ tance to take part in and sometimes on the de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; it came to pass that of a promise , that Jerem@@ y Hunt was made only last month that his door would always be revealed . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hunt needs to act now to raise awareness and concerns the concerns of the assistance .
&quot; should he not do this , so we have clearly made the assistance quot@@ ations that they are ready to perform further work actions . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a raise of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine surg@@ eries and 100,000 appointments to grant doctors at the strip chain . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes caused by adop@@ ting the reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ alities of British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants to be a better week@@ pay for the 54.@@ 000 Assi@@ di@@ aries , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , called Assi@@ sten@@ ik to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; working @-@ work measures do not only achieve little but un@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nursing and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the past two months , we talked to the Committee of Assi@@ stance Studies and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries , responded positively to concerns with regard to the mund@@ ane and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , training courses and gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - a sign of what it was the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in terms of compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;

culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness can be flour@@ ished in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was born last year to dismis@@ sal of a government &apos;s report on corruption from the Office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led that wide elect@@ oral campaigns was ignored in Muslim communities like a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , elect@@ oral and ro@@ ds to have evidence of elect@@ oral abuse due to &quot; over@@ sensitivity to ethnic and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , which now is an antagon@@ isms of religious motives so bad that it should be the police should be permitted to protect b@@ ills outside of elect@@ oral patterns to im@@ part@@ ed voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should carry out a credit card in order to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment a voters must be called his name and address .
&quot; the report suggests , not distant ink to bear on the fingers of a person when they vote their vote , to prevent someone twice . &quot;
&quot; wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
&quot; he calls that the press should have more access to common , and decisions made by no official committees or working groups . &quot;
&quot; this will not only serve against elect@@ oral fraud , but also the municipal government before the broader coral and fiscal culture , who goes with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged from Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets elect@@ oral election as in the east of London .
&quot; last year , an extraordinary Court decided that the am@@ end mayor Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man should be taken into cor@@ rup@@ tions and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court found that Rah@@ man would have betra@@ yed the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and that he would have brought his critics with r@@ attle and Islam@@ opho@@ bic exercise sessions . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is intended to have led his campaign on the basis , that it is the relative duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dubi@@ ous , or the consequence of a rep@@ lica , in which one person is chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he spoke particularly alar@@ ming to the fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent letter - in the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people would have made a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to s@@ ew the elect@@ oral system , including the guides , to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been ex@@ erted , especially women and young people to vote in accordance with Pakistan &apos;s will , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ ker background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions such a behavior due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to ethnic and religion would have ignored .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke of 50 recommendations to rest@@ art the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political activ@@ ist letters , to stop &quot; election &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also demands tough@@ er registration , in order to prevent the elect@@ oral directory on immigration and social mo@@ unts . &quot;
options considered to take voters before the election according to your ID .
don &apos;t be distant ink on the finger of a person once they have given their voice to prevent someone twice .
systematic over@@ insp@@ ections on the nationality of a person to make sure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic stamp .
b@@ anning that political activ@@ ist complete stamp and envel@@ opes of letters .
the police give the authority to set off round r@@ ence stations .
&quot; a legislative change , which facilit@@ ated an indic@@ t@@ ment for inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the repression of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photographer offered in elect@@ oral stations .
&quot; requirement that only English can be used in the elect@@ oral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to make sure the employees have the rule to enforce voters alone in the voting .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets Fall was not provided a criminal case .
&quot; the elect@@ oral Court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his representative on the basis of a L@@ it@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices as unt@@ apped , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , it became apparent in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - guilty . &quot;
it also cri@@ tici@@ zed the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controls &quot; of the elect@@ oral Committee in the Town Hall .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears as the mother of parli@@ aments , but the worrying and covered spread of elect@@ oral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

&quot; but the 24 @-@ year Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one to fight gold batt@@ ling ath@@ l@@ ete , who has his own famous dou@@ bl@@ ers - at least not when you believe the social media faith . &quot;
&quot; at the honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , created at the time on our screen fli@@ ers , FE@@ MA@@ IL created a lists of the Olymp@@ ics , which have more than just some simil@@ arity with Dutch . &quot;
&quot; the hunters and the wolf : teams member of the US team at Arch@@ ery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates double @-@ predecessor , many people on the Internet , many people on the Internet , such as a certain ar@@ cher of the Twin @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures , where he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secre@@ tly similar . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ scor@@ er got the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave him that he has already heard for his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not see any major simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , divided Br@@ ady the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I do that as ac@@ compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the obvious simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ jum@@ pers Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina , with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should go to a double @-@ predecessor for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool of the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another decent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett who has a similar ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ a@@ duct in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ coloured skin and bl@@ on@@ den hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , during the Americans Nathan Adrian received by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the Only : a Twitter user was very happy about that other simil@@ arities are also fallen .
theory in the room : according to this user there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps a reason
&quot; a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;

&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the base , moved their own stra@@ ights and p@@ ants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she was just there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; every rigi@@ d , when she returned the under@@ p@@ ants that you obviously did not like , because they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she reiter@@ ated the same with three other sub@@ p@@ ants before she finally decided that her nothing was liked to re @-@ adhesive , and departed . &quot;
&quot; it did not seem to inter@@ rupt that they had seen anyone watching - or about the person who would buy the under@@ p@@ ants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how hard to think that someone had under@@ p@@ ants having a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday morning .
&quot; Mrs Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; as I have joined , the staff attempts to pull the clothing items from the sale after they went - what is just as good . &quot;

how to protect themselves with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against arms
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to walk with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; whether you are approaching from the front or back , this video will show you how to rot@@ ate for your inc@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; if one turn to you from behind , then you should see yourself as a first step so that you can see your att@@ acker and move out of the loop , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the gun then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bows .
&quot; then propose him with the knee into the bar and turn , while the att@@ ackers broke down before pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move back , while she set the weapon to him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers who approach itself from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the line , grab the gun and turn it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; while the weight shift the gun at the same time , turn the gun towards the chest , then turn the gun out of his handle before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon to him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is Miz@@ ra@@ chi .

&quot; in front of the st@@ ains of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and to show us what he will be involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was recorded under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results in day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought to diver@@ ted the dishwasher of a mig@@ toil@@ ette that has already been used by thousands , but in fact they are in a kitchen sink more poor bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke to physicians and medical professionals across the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria , as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left , what he distr@@ acted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the Resi@@ stance of his intest@@ ines by jour@@ ne@@ yed through the world and ate independent , as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public money to railway stations , to the sin@@ ks of toilets , the task provided his immune system definitely under a sample . &quot;
&quot; in the film he told , &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in the film he was fair in any case .
&quot; the only thing he burned , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
his commission showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ms fresh washed hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to reject , after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ms came over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands are less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This comes the worst , which I have found in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will do nothing here because it is here inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company covers Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Vas@@ il@@ us , which includes both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D , to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer really something new . &quot;
something that &apos;s intri@@ gu@@ ing to the watch and at the same time explain the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; we did crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings with that , so that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot; &quot;
you claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to present them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information about the consumer in an interesting manner .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who brought the director of the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have arous@@ ed my respect for Ian when he had gotten some of things that I have reli@@ ed to him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ous Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things when it was simpler to bring Ian to it , they anz@@ ee and others in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad we recorded some of these dirty delicacies in film .
&quot; in one of Vali@@ o carried out survey from the year 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents of lac@@ tic acid bacteria , especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and gut and 58 per cent they said that they are at least occasionally using products , the lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
A@@ social family destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ er@@ ation social @-@ apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social @-@ home after a delay in the amount of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ ori@@ zes its neighbours . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash Corn@@ wall .
&quot; after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cked the property of the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls of arms holes on , wooden di@@ mp were burned down , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor , and gr@@ aff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were settled and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the administration of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they feared that the apartment was no longer able to fix . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare and I believe that people will not have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this estate is probably considered as much nic@@ er part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is ber@@ ed and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , the children lived in the apartment and the police told that the terror that had attached the family , road struggles with Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ers , shy , drugs , and excessive scre@@ ams , streams and flu@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , was given in June an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , that under circumstances be demol@@ ished , old tr@@ ash was found . &quot;
&quot; in the property , in which in the past drugs were tr@@ aded , the wooden di@@ mp@@ s were burned . &quot;
&quot; neighbours told that they had to fight them on the street , and regularly called the police again . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ o@@ gi@@ erte her and her partner this week by the estate , after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to be voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the delic@@ acy were ac@@ claimed by light@@ ened neighbors , which told her life to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They came about nobody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that there would be the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , which was called the police at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
on the superior side of the building site the rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it is the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family , as a delic@@ acy is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing is into consideration . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , as the behavior was extremely difficult and their deeds had to be seen for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community , who have cour@@ ageous to us and have made us the information we have made . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will con@@ sol@@ ation a couple of neighbours and the message that anti@@ social behavior will not be toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons were lived at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ ying on the ground
&quot; workers of the household administration now will have to be tr@@ ash or dreams , which surround the house . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house by and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as sc@@ ales , par@@ ap@@ hor@@ rors and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a donation after being guilty of the owner of a drug of a class B in commercial view .
&quot; she claimed that money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , the 2013 was with an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; after having been without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room@@ walls of the house were aff@@ lic@@ ated with gr@@ aff@@ iti .
&quot; the police tells that they will not arrange a ten@@ ants , which will not stop for the or@@ order . &quot;
Angela C@@ row by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who are not holding the or@@ ship .
&quot; this goes to those who can think of them without self @-@ alleg@@ ations , as well as those who were killed by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall is never toler@@ ated crimin@@ als and social behavior , which will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities . &quot;

&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp in the race , the doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House is growing . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in Utah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp against evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; blame was false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took his well @-@ known medi@@ ums . &quot;

&quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC answering Tru@@ mp on the question , as he wants to stop the eve of Cl@@ int@@ ons : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and if depos@@ ited : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;

&quot; if there is no rich in order for him at the end for the sake of political correctness , be it , &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; according to Press@@ views , the party should hold trust@@ s , funds for support of his election campaign , he should not present a better circulation values . &quot;

I would say we have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging the Bart@@ oli plays an older marriage .
she reminds herself with melanchol@@ y of her beloved with Tony , while younger Maria plays and dance . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .

and then there were Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so she is smart , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resem@@ bles my Italian character , which I have known as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of lob@@ es for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;

it is an enormous gener@@ ously man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compliments back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ d is for him a necessity .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his bub@@ bles , it is his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;

&quot; those who doesn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan &apos;s , sitting on packed caffeine , by the way the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ aries , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported on the appointment of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks presented already before the coup d largest group in favour of political persecution recognised asylum in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on the date of 30 June , it was 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all being eligible for asylum ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , do not find themselves the war , poverty or an tiv@@ ess@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , so by state @-@ of @-@ state @-@ General , individual persec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; to go there , where there is w@@ ailing &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer @-@ election campaign , and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia are not allowed to choose the country . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; 2021 will not occur once again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for sil@@ ly as so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and landsc@@ ap@@ ing battle - that &apos;s going on . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the elect@@ oral fighters are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country are on Us@@ edom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so do not choose the country . &quot;
&quot; these practical problems come : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , which posters posters , air balloon , fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers , and at the end of the vote , only mills . &quot;
&quot; until the 4th of September 2016 , the elect@@ oral and final days , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass closer to the people in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it also goes to something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 strongest party , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
thri@@ lling is how strong new@@ com@@ er Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ aug@@ mentation .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 government commission@@ er , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous campaign , one sees from his grand@@ parents . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distributed ros@@ es and ch@@ atting a little with the people , as it also did his legendary predec@@ essors Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
otherwise he got a past@@ oral feet and there is ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the blame in the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; Ascension of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now probably going to cost the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top channel data , the Interior Lor@@ enz Caf@@ fier , has already experienced how it is , when you make the wrong time at the right place of voting . &quot;
she was invited twice the ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ fac@@ tions ; Merkel Bundestag in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group was not , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Meckl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but there is a shame to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel listen . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the North @-@ CD@@ U are largely disp@@ ens@@ ed to the usual elect@@ oral areas on market places and on shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and air balloon . &quot;
&quot; that , so does Kok@@ ert , play only an &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also , the Union has gem@@ ated that you have to wi@@ ped out the base in the country that she needs to be very strict again to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely any of the countries of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U elect@@ ors co@@ ert to his fellow @-@ gates , however , is also self @-@ evident : &quot; they must go then where men are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot of stake is on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called upon an especially dedicated elect@@ oral campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last finally with 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
the SPD was still clear with 35,@@ 6 per cent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small part@@ ei , with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should be able to jump the jump into the country . &quot;
they make a modern virtu@@ es holiday and lay out its elect@@ oral battle on the internet .
&quot; online elect@@ ors &quot; , &quot; it calls the Prince Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green elect@@ oral fighters move on sp@@ ur@@ en@@ search for native stimul@@ ant among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top @-@ can@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ ische lakes and finds it even nice . &quot;
your impression : &quot; choice holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment : Gast@@ ro@@ wer suffer from sper@@ ms
&quot; in the quick@@ ness , with which the B 27 is refurbished , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and only until 8 pm , there is all@@ enth@@ used praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything quite delicate , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff by the jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no failure .
&quot; the construction site could be moved to the half @-@ beginning to the half @-@ season as scheduled to the south , until the end of October it shall be ready . &quot;
&quot; blessed will also be the de@@ part of the persons responsible for the construction work , for example , when it comes to furnis@@ hing arrangements . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site started on Monday to the south and also the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted , and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has a relaxed place . &quot;
citizens can now go back from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 .
the us@@ es@@ hips by the place seems to be returned .
&quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; says the trans@@ duc@@ tor management of the refurb@@ ishment Vice @-@ Chief Executive Officer Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of the Bachelor &apos;s Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ strasse and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many shots were examined and rather their Nav@@ i confidential than the signs . &quot;
what led to man@@ holes in residential areas in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed of changes have not been respected , the community demanded the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable crossing , &quot; says King , who was able to kun@@ ze himself on the spot . &quot;
already two to three per minute has been heated .
the fastest was done with 77 pcs kilometers at the pace @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site is further drawn , but it has become more quiet . &quot;
&quot; for the busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again . &quot;
we do not like to look at the maps of the busin@@ ess@@ men .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to sales among them , everyone who asks one to look . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; End@@ less &quot; , &quot; for other companies , for which the refurb@@ ishment has hardly consequences . &quot;
&quot; also in the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most light decrease , &quot; but also one that is of course not missing &quot; &quot; the run @-@ customer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the most exploited are the Local along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , find clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the hospitality provided it &apos; hard . &quot;
&quot; it was missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen , and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we must be glad to be happy about each of the Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lower sales ship@@ ments he rose to &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the stre@@ et@@ ens@@ ation made its operation &quot; by two years back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have to release them .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , the policy would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the reference , the host@@ el@@ ets otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location at the B . now , they also benefit the dis@@ advantages that arise through the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other land@@ circles where you have been dealt with so much more .
&quot; with all pl@@ agues , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his guest house will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , family business has been settled in the long time since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
that other tri@@ bal people are now less frequent because of complicated traffic run less often can he understand .
&quot; if you cannot walk , it is also quite different . &quot;
&quot; that its stem cli@@ ent@@ ele after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , again , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the greatest crisis , which has experienced its hospitality in her many years of history . &quot;
&quot; six months construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
constantly being rob@@ bery in the name of the terrorist fight against laws .
after the recent attacks the Interior de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a th@@ icker safety package .
but what has a d@@ ular status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ ases says to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Recon@@ c@@ iler .
&quot; all his proposals were politically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister in the presentation of his new security packages . &quot;
they do not demand anyone .
&quot; others , further points would be discussed at first within the parties . &quot;
&quot; again , I was also looking forward to that . &quot;
&quot; but as an Interior Minister he was situated at the results , and at a &quot; &quot; al@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach dropped a little time before he presents his conclusions for the safety of the Republic . &quot;
&quot; however , the fall of this is all the most extensive . &quot;
&quot; some is already known , announced that there is a new security authority in order to take care of the knot@@ ted communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations for air passengers and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the safety authorities is not surprising .
&quot; partly , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had a second call for proposals which had been so far to do with the SPD : he wants to pose a sympath@@ iz@@ er for Terr@@ org@@ os among punishment and jiha@@ dists with double citizenship in the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; spatial of the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; however , he still consider it to be reasonable and don &apos;t have any chance whatsoever with the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ acy . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère as well .
these are partly in itself : he is planning quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the det@@ ention of people before deportation .
&quot; refugees , which are targeted into the country , should be disclosed to their smartphones , and disclose social media accounts for a safety check . &quot;
&quot; for exp@@ ul@@ ls for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about such that commit crimes or making their papers consciously to wear their identity . &quot;
some of this is political and legal .
some also acts un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of puzzles , for example - raises the question : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not possible to speak that the attacks by Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many people are worried about the high amount of refugees concerned about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that the people have deeply dealt , even in the election times it did not come out . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the insurance is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elect@@ oral campaigns . &quot;
the European Union and SPD express themselves increasingly on the subject of internal security .
the two parties grew up between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ sti@@ ger argument about the equipment of the federal government , then via an safety @-@ policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Interior , who are calling for a bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also here to reconc@@ iling notes .
&quot; from a revers@@ al of the double @-@ pass , he is nothing . &quot;
we learned the discussion in Germany .
&quot; it is new to you , whether it is not useful . &quot;
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own par@@ cel has been constitutional , and whether it is &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ Partners , it must first show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of things that could care for dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to create internal security on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes only in careful conversation and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;
&quot; yet , Volkswagen glimp@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; despite diesel @-@ sc@@ and@@ als , the ship@@ ments increase worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs around .
in the back @-@ mail there is a term .
Volkswagen starts with suppliers in the second half @-@ year .
Europe &apos;s largest bus line can continue in the previous year despite the diesel sector thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ moving markets further a plus .
&quot; but in July the nuclear brand VW especially weak@@ ened in Western Europe and res@@ ili@@ ent to the total sale , like that in the D@@ ax not@@ ched companies . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW brand sell in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ es the disp@@ at@@ ches around almost a six .
brand@@ s@@ ef Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , it has given it in some core markets through &quot; changed economic framework &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey the British V@@ ot@@ um resign@@ ed for the resign@@ ation from the EU , explained a speech spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , where the car@@ bure@@ au first escal@@ ate first , is also further a minus one to book . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected area @-@ herd of the Nieder@@ sachsen is already limited to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months is merely a disp@@ enser of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
consolidated Fred Kap@@ pler was able to continue a sales department from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this time worldwide : 4.@@ 904 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust .
&quot; alone in Germany , VW around 2.5 million vehicles calls for conversion to the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of conversion , VW , that the re@@ building of the car has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after changing the vehicles , it will give power consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power . &quot;
&quot; the motorway exit the customer after conversion a &quot; guaranteed duty &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in business travel . &quot;
reason is legal en@@ tru@@ ths .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reports , Volkswagen ge@@ es its German customers now but a guarantee for a steady diesel models . &quot;
that would have been confirmed on the last Monday of VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
&quot; from the traffic Ministry , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has to fulfil the resolution of my investig@@ ative Commission and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; variations of this is not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that for fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor performance after switching , no deteri@@ or@@ ations will take place and all type of mark@@ ing@@ relevant vehicle values have unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it did in business travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen the possibility that customers can come to a workshop after conversion approximately with an engine harm to a workshop - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; also in customer interest , it is important to avoid any damage caused by any other damage which has nothing to do with the detri@@ mental sc@@ andal at all , as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we use VW the term &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see calls for rich Spar@@ ers in future criminal law - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; chair Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ time accounts . &quot;
the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher banks speaks of an individual case and sees it no signal : normal austerity would have to be feared not to pay for their spar@@ se criminal law .
&quot; storage banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0,@@ 4 percent pen@@ al code . &quot;
this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September from private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on g@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ time accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euro are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has risen up to 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other , and that he could not be wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; they remain with me on the bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; said the bank@@ note . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lie for any million 4000 euros . &quot;
he will now give the costs after the re@@ urs@@ ement principle .
&quot; to let the cash just lie in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve experienced it already four survi@@ ving , I would not have the fifth place ! &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ quet . &quot;
most customers would have more understanding and varied to other systems forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association agreed : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB has caused considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; you are alone to wear , be &quot; &quot; audit@@ ors &quot; &quot; is permanently possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
with imp@@ anz@@ ee for deposits as of three million euros had made the Thür@@ inger Volks@@ - and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with its skat@@ bank branch 2014 head@@ lines .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , main business leader of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect that private customers have to pay for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong in Germany and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ el that is equipped with the property a little lush . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if they get free money . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ ven , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
in the region living well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; are currently not known for foreign banks that calculate an out@@ sourcing for deposits of private customers , &quot; said to Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ banks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had explained : &quot; the threshold , to neg@@ atives to neg@@ atives toward private customers , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition was hard , and it dro@@ ves the emig@@ ration of investors to competitors . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not have fallen in width .
destination plates : who does not buy it ?
lonely men middle age love plates .
&quot; before you hur@@ ry to the commentary box , in order to ski@@ p it under the pseud@@ onym of non @-@ aging men &apos;s or@@ ages with r@@ ust ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the varied re@@ building of sound is not based on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to greet the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but also to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are all predic@@ tive after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers .
it is also not a hormone by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older flat @-@ runners rather keep her feelings rather for himself ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soho , a modest road in Soho , before I keep ste@@ al , my hands hold and something determined to say like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ hos is slowly entering his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now complete the building where independent sellers are located - there are still a handful of fantastic record shop . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman , to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and security through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I was by S@@ ister Ray ( dates : two young women , three men middle age ) to the Rec@@ ord@@ ess Records ( dates : eight men middle age ) , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and going through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , ask me ? &quot;
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets . &quot;
&quot; this sound plates , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed by him ) , dress up the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : he is now able to purchase plates that he could not afford , when they had appeared and again sold items that he sold , when he was young and pl@@ ague . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70@@ s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things when I was probably something to young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy the boards , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and likes to spend time , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much . &quot;
this is my rag .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who is working with S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who meet at You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe people who have heard about the com@@ eback , and let &apos;s see their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually have been kidn@@ apped around 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records now , &quot; he says . &quot;
that would explain the boom to tr@@ ailers of the record revised of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Ph@@ onica to recognize that record shop has a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers attended the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
some record @-@ fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to pull out to the stability of trusted mu@@ k@@ ets , of objects , the happy it@@ or@@ der@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material owner than a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is as a collector as a collector so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to go spirit@@ ually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ utes a staff of a record stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people , the last month have bought a record , they have not yet been heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % possess a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who have a record , no record player . &quot;
at this time of the message report I would probably look very concerned while I met with a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( dates : three men middle age ) , has noticed a &quot; Tro@@ ph@@ ä@@ en@@ as@@ pe@@ kt &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; &quot; I had no record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely happening . &quot;
&quot; produced more product , less music . &quot;
&quot; we have people , who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who come only slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p which has dedicated to the sound plates almost an entire floor , has a b@@ ump@@ y audience than I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make pictures , teenagers and women middle age . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ester syn@@ thesi@@ zers and sex@@ be@@ pack@@ er pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ans from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks quite lonely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to be adjustable when one stands next to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs in business for a couple of minutes and looked at the table of the table on sale . &quot;
it is more likely a showcase of man@@ mor@@ tal than a big one .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so the collecting of sheets is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from one computer or another way but the beauty of plates is ... it drives with an ad@@ orable sig@@ h .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a store , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban output . &quot;
&quot; while I give the ticket to m@@ ust@@ ers the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants , watching a group of young teen@@ ager , group@@ ed for a moment about Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter superior to buy a cro@@ sl@@ ey record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Bu@@ ckl@@ ey , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees her - maybe because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them . &quot;
&quot; it is pure &quot; record &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , the one that is most for luxury equ@@ ations such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my post @-@ for@@ ties agree that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they let at least exist in turn@@ around in Soho , the large number of female collectors and turn@@ tables that exist in reality , record shop and in online for@@ es . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday tomorrow with security not with the be@@ um@@ bles through records of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they avoid the rigi@@ d view of an un@@ fur@@ tive , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator to rag@@ ing over the shoulders of nothing short of middle age . &quot;

French Court held its offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , doz@@ ens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; at a court proceedings this week was argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be fu@@ elled to sell 72 pro@@ vis@@ ors shop , selling cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ beverages , sell hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few Euro in provisional eat@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be crus@@ hed , because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid , and that is a fire risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the stores and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state supported Association and other groups are not sufficient to provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for issu@@ ing people who run the 72 provisional business , but spatial one that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais will be absolutely trac@@ eable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than those who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of calm meeting between refugees and volunteers offer .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the defe@@ ats , the young Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , the community was operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on Asyl@@ um , for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &quot; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian did it , that the closure &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the recent eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants dro@@ wned at Friday , that the number of artists living in the jungle living over 9.@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise in nine years in the course of summer . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er must set up on the next generation of speed shelf life : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested especially effectively , the Temp@@ os@@ ende are to be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic real En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example to in@@ genu@@ ity , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to gentle bridges with temporary templates , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure the speed limit on speed . &quot;
a lasting mobile design can be too dangerous or time @-@ consuming .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is aut@@ ark : its cordless holds five days , the fall data is encrypted via a mo@@ dem . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , laser technology can also be recorded at the same time all vehicles over several tracks at the same time . &quot;
variable speed limit and passage to time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
in the high @-@ moving state you can move the p@@ endant according to manufacturer with any car with a cl@@ ut@@ ch .
&quot; so that he is not simply cloth@@ ed in the fair , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the se@@ ater in front of v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
since 2015 the trailer for data from Vit@@ ronic is tested in various federal states and is now also used .
&quot; foreign authorities bl@@ amed with the new technique : recently , France has made 100 pieces of Georgia , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain gets silver in 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold pick up
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were be@@ aten up with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the de @-@ 7 stage in Rio .
&quot; Fi@@ ji distributed a masterpiece in handling , side @-@ stepp@@ ing , desc@@ endant , scheduled run and ro@@ wer power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ aille of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was failed by the not too bad tro@@ st@@ rate of the silver medal - Great Britain in this day - and they could be proud to be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could be returned to them in the final . &quot;
but independently of it Fi@@ ji could have done a 15 @-@ man team in the form of making a 15 @-@ man team .
&quot; it could be a comfort for UK - but will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck , Fi@@ j@@ is Chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss of England from Wim@@ bl@@ edon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind .
eight years ago she lost under Ryan every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap is going to do , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and made the attacks GB@@ s from having fun abor@@ tions .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell , and Co. at when one would run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with a four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai even another attack from the right corner he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball attached .
&quot; a h@@ is@@ rag@@ out T@@ ackle of Mitchell stops the mountain by Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third door , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute L@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch@@ down and there stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the revival and there was still more than one minute season ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ets by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and rus@@ hes up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play , the 7 to play , while in the UK . &quot;
so it is also .
&quot; GB led basic changes to half @-@ time , and closed the fi@@ ji@@ b gap ... for all four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game worked for a long time in favour of the south @-@ isl@@ anders , his fans s@@ angen and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the i @-@ gland with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the wh@@ arf , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and GB k@@ ick@@ ed be@@ aten in the lawn . &quot;
previous in the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK dr@@ unk South Africa in a scar@@ f half @-@ round match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton crossed the line with an impressive walk and achieved a gate below the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ tic of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , absorbed the profit - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ ine Gold than those games and that will be what hot .
&quot; from the first rowing machine to the last , 220 harsh H@@ ieve , who enter the story , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in its golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it was only the examples who were on the ruin , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was always present when she graduated from the second Olymp@@ ag@@ old in a row without tax woman who had first women in the history of the British sports which had such a standard . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her increased un@@ created use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , which is over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflected in the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in hiber@@ nation , an batt@@ ali@@ on at willing hel@@ pers help to make the difference and there was no one lon@@ ged than the coach that would not survive at least 30 months , when he was diagnosed with him cancer . &quot;
as he said he was risky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is op@@ eri@@ able and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do it , he spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a fairly sh@@ lim@@ me situation .
it changes a bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could start in early 2014 , outside the season , begin what the inter@@ ruption went to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the proper term . &quot;
I needed money so I had to go back soon .
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they told that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the ruin is already a challenge , but it makes it a greater challenge . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ medi@@ um@@ ability of the victory their first thought of Williams , who spent a ner@@ able tomorrow with it to talk a little more than usual , and thus tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was a emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it was repeated just how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I could not have a better person for the train@@ able or better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had to shut up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught in the moment .
&quot; hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
&quot; it is really important , not to be part of it . &quot;
we had a good start and at the same time we were not willing to make a little T@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; we did not want to get a fire@@ work , we just wanted to get a good result and win the race what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before taking decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adventure in your Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she simply wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that I was my last race .
this would have had a lot of pressure .
&quot; in London it took about six months to grasp , that I am an Olymp@@ ics . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years have been exempl@@ ary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the water purpose &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert Gö@@ ller , continues to retirement . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bav@@ ern@@ far vor@@ exempl@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small fresh water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
so it was some time ago in the original building in a contribution to the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
&quot; after a little later , the water @-@ forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken defended the kenn@@ els . &quot;
the work of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ gruppe gel@@ ed &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this there is Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , who was 31 years in the twen@@ ties , 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he was retired from 65 years at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose of the V@@ eit@@ endorf group with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 locations and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 residents . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the Church of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Baun@@ ah . &quot;
for further towns and municipalities there are water supplies .
&quot; the current chair , Breit@@ brun@@ ns mayor , Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller was appointed as a water@@ mark and has already been appointed Managing Director of the kenn@@ el . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very varied and they extended to work on office and maintenance activities via office and maintenance activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency movements at weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events they called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land@@ lords in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re@@ building of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the re@@ ali@@ zations of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; I have not given any down@@ times , and you always recorded new additions , because water is de@@ pressed and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used a lot of heart@@ bl@@ ut for his water@@ purpose , and he used the water @-@ purpose linked to the water @-@ purpose association , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
a few weeks ago he served as a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ gruppe for nit@@ rat@@ ch@@ ement in front of the water forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
&quot; for this , he has received a lot of recognition and praise . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller on the part commen@@ dable water @-@ do@@ van Al@@ f@@ ons g@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water presence and he was a faithful d@@ cap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlights from his point of view , he describes the well @-@ building and the re @-@ structured of the kenn@@ el . &quot;
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were however the pipe @-@ breaking down at Kirch@@ ner on a 3rd January .
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night has to work through , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also , the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained once , because you filled the plan@@ ters of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hat@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; the management of drinking water purpose , was handed over to Daniel storms from Lau@@ ter , who enter the succ@@ ession of Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller . &quot;

relationship buil@@ ders in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ tern - man sho@@ ots on life @-@ mate
a 35 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old man has shot up on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ tern ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and is fatal .
&quot; the man himself inv@@ oked with us and stated his life @-@ mate , &quot; said a police spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators would be on the run , after him will be publicly proclaimed . &quot;
&quot; now nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be on the way by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 m tall , mus@@ cular , brown and has a gl@@ at@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police has released a photo of it . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
meanwhile the man carries a gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he can still carry the weapon in itself , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who can see Sven S. , the 110 is supposed to call . &quot;
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators of 1981 . &quot;
&quot; in Lübeck , the police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the ather@@ cord or the relationship between the perpet@@ rators and victims ; but they confirmed that a human being killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a sol@@ der @-@ deli@@ ble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more we do not say , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person in Lübeck . &quot;
ey@@ e@@ witnesses therefore was a special task force ( SE@@ K ) at the scene .
steel - Light@@ view for German St@@ ah@@ lin@@ ers
the rot@@ ary @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains of additional costs in million@@ aires .
&quot; financial stress , which are dro@@ wned by the industry from the Eco @-@ cost reduction , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it stay in the exemp@@ tion from the renewable energy balance in measurement systems for so @-@ called up @-@ to @-@ date production in the German steel industry , the Federal Republic of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; Western German &quot; newspaper &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Fri@@ day@@ . ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission had planned , therefore , planned to use the steel manufacturer , the gases from the ho@@ cho@@ p to generate electricity from the stool . &quot;
the steel industry thre@@ aten additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a basic certificate with the EU Commission for discussions with competition Com@@ miss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel @-@ steel , tr@@ ap by 20 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot;
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for its own energy generation .
this will largely be written to the status quo of the previous regime .
particular importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos;s steel , the future is a first step . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; others need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emissions of emissions are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ Chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 under over@@ capacity and a substantial price pressure .
&quot; last year , the situation continues to intensi@@ fy as the world @-@ largest revival of China in the face of the weaker domestic demand for steel on the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers throw Chinese fer@@ ing @-@ dump@@ ing dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has a little relaxed .
&quot; to show a ban on import duties on Im@@ port@@ stahl effect , on the other hand the economic views in China have asc@@ ended . &quot;
unclear is how lasting the price @-@ up is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained careful on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have been more stag@@ nat@@ ing . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further costs .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also wanted not to ex@@ clude some of the works of individual works .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ ,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel manufacturer remain careful despite rising prices and growing orders . &quot;
&quot; they produced more than 3.4 million tons of less raw materials than in the previous year , such as the economic union of steel on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the aforementioned set went back to the second month in succ@@ ession . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the production is by two percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order intake in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing seniors good
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as young girls she was in the school choir , in the university studies she passed the subject of music , and today sings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; &quot; describes them . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , cheerful and overall lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , her health and spirit does something good . &quot;
&quot; for singing is equal from several perspectives , a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hac@@ kler by the German Senior Bundes@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most seniors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes Hac@@ kler . &quot;
through regular inter@@ iors you can establish social contacts and maintain social contacts .
&quot; they often solve social and familiar structures at the age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp made in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize themselves to the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense means Hac@@ kler .
because they are practicing a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who regularly asks his lungs , also in everyday life not as fast as the d@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; even if it is about to get the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Association of senior citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher place , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently observed that the singing or sound of songs with older men awak@@ ens many memories , often linked to positive emotions of their youth @-@ time . &quot;
through Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and particularly melo@@ dies of his tun@@ es himself deny people in a long past events .
&quot; at singing , the head also requires special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
at the same time concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; just older people who live alone , practice so , not just to focus on yourself . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through the singing in the choir , mean Hac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I am long for something , I will be better and more awake over me - this experience will strengthen . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with the singing , there is so enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he says to have little talent . &quot;
&quot; one sings not alone - with 50 singing people who listen , when a sound goes off ? &quot;
&quot; looking for the right offer , seniors have different options , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sing someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , one can easily join . &quot;
many cities also offer insights about the cho@@ irs in the area .
anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn right to the church or the church .
many seniors cho@@ irs can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; whoever does not have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help at the internet computer . &quot;
&quot; who desire has to sing , should be part of a chor@@ us , betra@@ ying Hac@@ kler . &quot;
sing the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - this is true of every age .
cats react to sensitive as K@@ ater on scre@@ ams of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover which effect the herd of Katz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise the rental also caused the males not cold , but they stopped in contrast to the females always equal . &quot;
female cats can recognize the excit@@ ability of Katz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the Mi@@ ws of the Small Ones .
they respond to ten percent more quickly to lu@@ te of kittens who choose to be found in great distress as scientists from the veterinary university and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react to the herd of kittens - however always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently , the acoustic differences between the r@@ ust of less and heavy @-@ reg@@ ained juven@@ iles for the males are either not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is the first authorized in the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch @-@ height of the kittens with the ur@@ gency of its help is different . &quot;
watched at a total of nine adults K@@ ater and eight k@@ ies out of the beast of the MH@@ H .
&quot; you were played for a herd of small children , taken for three minutes from the throw box and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; for the other , they were faced with scre@@ ams of stronger kit@@ ties which were additionally raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers consider their results despite the low sampling for sc@@ iss@@ ors .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scri@@ be , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
she turned faster to the l@@ oud@@ speaker when this herd of the very ch@@ reg@@ ated kittens .
this ability may possibly en@@ i@@ ores or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded in at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined several times when people studied the reactions of women and men in pairs of baby . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants , whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ el . &quot;
Pod@@ ol@@ ski attacks with &quot; g@@ ala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is in Turkey a football legend .
in Turkey against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver a arrest warran@@ t had been en@@ acted .
&quot; he is cast , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; for the first time after the coup , Turkey takes place an important football match in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Pod@@ ol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as usual &quot; is said .
&quot; even in the postpon@@ ement of the exp@@ ul@@ ence after the overthrow in July , the government , the everyday life of norm@@ alities will not be affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup . &quot;
&quot; thereby , even before the football is not ma@@ iled . &quot;
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver the Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Prosec@@ utor to the Prosec@@ utor .
&quot; according to this , it is thrown out in America in South America as a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
addi@@ ctions shall be p@@ endant of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; this applies to the first of 90 days of exp@@ ul@@ ent state still until October , in fact , this has the life of the most Turks , but as well as no effect . &quot;
the next @-@ night &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; on public places all over the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday .
the sport is - as the whole country - split in fans and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; clubs B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but what the gro@@ s of the Turks , but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans themselves agree - regardless of whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or bun@@ ni@@ kt@@ as .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; will be especially back to Luke Pod@@ ol@@ ski .
his sporting value was shown in the exp@@ ired season under proof : with 17 gates and nine officers in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as a top scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ tre@@ ffer .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; told him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
it has completed the season in an excellent way and its crew secured the Cup .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; , &quot; the disappointing season was at the record champion for the record champion . &quot;
&quot; after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; also differ@@ ing out in the Europa League . &quot;
in the south of Li@@ g it only went to rank six .
the season was not good .
the Cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; this is what we made and that is the most important , &quot; said Pod@@ ol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as ran the game year better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who took on the basis of 14 tracks as an Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ vin@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig , the basis of the 14th title . &quot;
that is also the reason that the fans continue to return to the return of the 31 year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , at the AC Florence under the contract standing and transferred to B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as only borro@@ wed Gom@@ ez according to the coup d , due to the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario would like to come to us , he must only say &quot; , &quot; the journal &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ chef Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the storms would have to be prepared to rel@@ inqu@@ ish about one third of his to 7.5 million Euros . so , Or@@ man said , &quot; &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence , we cannot pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have even medals for Olymp@@ ics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was locked twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa may not launch in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics sc@@ ams can only laugh it - they fight in Rio to medals .
the subject of dop@@ ing determines how to follow the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian bath@@ tu@@ te in Julian J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who turned off after a dop@@ ing lock her start right just before playing ( 100 metres chest ) mer@@ ging off @-@ off @-@ off and un@@ f@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; it offered himself a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenario : with a mixed smile she was still in the hall , and had prov@@ oked with their appearance . &quot;
&quot; as proof that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a jubil@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; however , there are many more sports@@ men that despite dop@@ ing past during the Olympic Games in Rio to start . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked up twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his B@@ ann the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion runs even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered to be the biggest requirement of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ eight Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress and si@@ eben@@ stein WH@@ EN had to sit down in 2010 after taking the intake of the pain by ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; she had had strong dental pain after a surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended themselves . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 was the Olympic Olymp@@ ics of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster@@ in from 2010 to 2016 positively to the bot@@ tom@@ less stimul@@ ant tool meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine tested . &quot;
Per@@ kovic con@@ cludes the pain@@ st@@ ful intake and has been locked six months .
the four main thro@@ ws in this year go to the account of the great gold class ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olymp@@ ics and two @-@ four world champion over 400 m , was carried out positively and 21 months have been locked . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement would have been responsible , bet@@ tered Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has over 200 and 400 m from the far fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any Ath@@ l@@ ete were identified as many medals . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on his World Cup did not lost nine years later , after having been established testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; by now 40 @-@ year @-@ old , Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 had to give birth @-@ silver @-@ D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone failure . &quot;
this also recognized Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille from the Olympic Games in 2008 he was given back on account of a part of the International Sports Tribunal .
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is on the rank two of the world list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the Wel@@ com@@ rade and Gold@@ S@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; during the 29 years old World Championship , references to the intake of one ver@@ tex supplements have been found , the Sper@@ re of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency W@@ ada fell mild and ran already on 13th July . &quot;
bom@@ bs in Thailand - Austri@@ ans in@@ ju@@ red - Mi@@ xed T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of State , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ early . &quot;
&quot; she suffered schn@@ it@@ tw@@ ist and had been treated in the hospital , but this has already been able to leave . &quot;
it was planned for the beginning of September for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the holi@@ day@@ island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g , and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on , are also not yet unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at this regard to the contact with local authorities , so be@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; in about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hua H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; according to police , a Tha@@ il@@ change has been killed and about 20 people were in@@ ju@@ red , among them the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three defe@@ ats and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; early in the morning , two explo@@ si@@ ves went high , and according to the authorities a further man was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bom@@ bs .
in the det@@ on@@ ation near the near the popular bad@@ min@@ ands Pat@@ ong was in@@ ju@@ red by police information a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ eastern coast of the country then explo@@ de another bom@@ b that was a city .
the spr@@ inkl@@ ing is according to the authorities in a flower set before the Re@@ four of the coastal police force in the air .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations demanded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the southeast coast . &quot;
&quot; from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was meant . &quot;
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ ent@@ ate carry the same manus@@ cript , &quot; said army @-@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ early in front of journalists . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attacks . &quot;
it is too early to express himself about possible moti@@ fs - probably the acts of Muslim rebels .
also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the bom@@ b attack Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , the attacks cannot be connected with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is obvious that the bom@@ bs were laid out by oppos@@ ers of the ruling military j@@ unt@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the authorities would have received secrecy in recent days of secrecy in the south of the country - however , they do not have been informed of the exact time and the places . &quot;
yet be unclear which group behind the attacks corner .
&quot; the police dismis@@ sed their officials in the whole country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b attacks , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hua H@@ in is a palace which has been used over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to the partners , the Austrian Ministry of Bom@@ ben@@ explo@@ sions recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on its Homepage , to make the instructions of the Thai security authorities in a consequence . &quot;
&quot; high safety risk ( security level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ ah as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after disputes between the security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no longer necessary journeys to these provinces . &quot;
higher security risk ( security stage 2 ) suffered for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday lasted a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military j@@ unt@@ a .
the military influence over the military influence also in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta manager and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bom@@ bs were an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ens chaos , while the country toward stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military unt@@ a , which had taken power in 2014 after a period of bloody crimes , the kingdom holds right again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it is also the military did not have succeeded in getting a handle for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people were killed . &quot;
&quot; just a year ago , in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is under the vision@@ aries of the Bundes@@ am@@ end for Constitutional Court .
&quot; after several sections , the Constitutional Court also presented the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &quot; &quot; identi@@ t@@ arian movement &apos; approach to efforts against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; said the Constitutional Court of Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
thus Zu@@ w@@ other Islamic faith or from the Middle East is diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist way .
that is why we are monitoring the movement well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Constitutional Court in nine Länder - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thuringia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; already . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said his authority is closely aligned with the state of the country .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ fying Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking extre@@ mi@@ sts , addressing them with juven@@ ile language , often with p@@ opp@@ iger music . &quot;
the Islam@@ ists of Islam@@ ists as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not praying advertising for your own thing .
the propaganda shall speak the people emotion@@ ally .
young people are being pr@@ one in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , from several federal states had given reports on the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , I have no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species can only be relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , which are extrem@@ ist , changes their destination and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the key factor is whether such individuals are controlling influence over the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view of the marked increase of right@@ ful criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and Refu@@ ge@@ es , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have established over the past few years that it can give rights @-@ free structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fri@@ day@@ group .
&quot; it can be quite that other legal group@@ ings or small groups constitute the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extremis@@ m . &quot;
but a nation@@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of rect@@ ang@@ ror@@ ism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ate outw@@ ard that many over@@ gri@@ ps went over to the account of people who were not at the right scene in the right scene . &quot;
this is the worrying .
&quot; many of the alleg@@ ory of attacks on Asyl@@ um , were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed criminal off@@ ences who had previously had nothing at the hat that were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left have chosen which however radi@@ cal@@ ised by far @-@ wing extremis@@ m . &quot;

this shows the brave appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics center fluctu@@ ates the slightly overweight swimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures . &quot;
it disappeared and simple - no matter how far the detail was chosen .
in social networks Hab@@ te was subsequently used for the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a return of 48 seconds to its predec@@ essors and took the 5@@ 9th square of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather his not the athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participating in the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians got a special starting from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in lower countries well @-@ known countries .
&quot; as in ether , most sports@@ men have just wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the lap .
some media signed it as &quot; RO@@ BEL of the whale . &quot;
&quot; in a &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; The English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ blatt , &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; was funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he proposed only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter style , as played no part . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also pulled .

&quot; in An@@ leg@@ alization travel , it was on Friday , with the shareholders , last but the disappointment about the continuing success of years ago has been a restructuring of years ago . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ Tip since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of the restructuring are also still not seen after 5 years , &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K @-@ business , everyone will be able to participate at some point at some point . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW the case , this would also be the qu@@ and@@ ts . &quot;
the company had not been able to stop his loss in the preceding quarters in the second quarter of 2016 .
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales increased by 6,@@ 1 per cent under the level of the compar@@ ative pre @-@ year figure . &quot;
&quot; compared to the first half @-@ year , sales generated with 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros by 3.4 per cent . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the profit in the second quarter mainly has the value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; the Consumer Experience necessary in the business area of Consumer Experience is necessary to compens@@ ate for 139 million euros , under the state a loss of 14@@ 8,@@ 2 million euros . &quot;
in the second quarter of 2015 the Gf@@ K had gained a group of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
inci@@ dents - Bus sli@@ ce in Kru@@ mm@@ aking n in Gr@@ aben : eight Ver@@ sions
during an accident of a travel bus with 43 seniors as driving guests are on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ aking n ( district Aur@@ ich ) eight people have been in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 years old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to impose their details according to a opposite steering wheel , which was partly taken on the counter@@ track . &quot;
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a speech of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; because of the location of the bus , the persons were unable to leave the bus self @-@ constantly , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire@@ men fre@@ ed the in@@ mates .
six lif@@ ebo@@ ats and a Not@@ arz@@ tw@@ agen came to the accident at the National Road 2 .
the in@@ ju@@ red travelers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ aking district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus in the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the trucks and possible witnesses to report on the police .
&quot; rates per Ku@@ bi@@ km@@ eter waste is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( so far from 3.@@ 18 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( so far 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the installation in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will once again increase once again if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after an over@@ heated lim@@ estone , the wast@@ ew@@ ater price in Az@@ endorf is then available at 4,@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; like Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found in the approval of the budget by the land of the Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these wast@@ ew@@ ater structures . &quot;
the Market Kas@@ endorf is committed to the basis of a legal basis to operate the systems free of charge .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ank , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg have to hold more deeply into the wall@@ et . &quot;
ag@@ itation increases between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt showed the body , was a re @-@ cal@@ ulation of fees for the dra@@ inage systems of the market gener@@ als . &quot;
&quot; during the period of October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or sub @-@ covers from the previous calendar period . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ vi@@ cal sal@@ inity increases in Schmidt so that there are relatively small water@@ ways around relatively small facilities with a very low wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution foundation , for example , to affect the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water is slightly decreased in all three plants . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the backward cap@@ aci@@ ation period in all three plants , last but not least because of its age rolling , and repar@@ ations were in@@ sured in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the plant for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt pointed out that in the mineral @-@ water Az@@ endorf , the mechanical aer@@ ation system had to be exchanged due to a damage . &quot;
&quot; in P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years old promot@@ ers had to be over@@ hau@@ led and carried out at the pond @-@ position Lop@@ p to un@@ fold after nearly 20 years of operation of the first cl@@ amping pl@@ ung@@ ing and an additional ventilation system , in order to keep the water legal requirements even in future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses were taken into account the continued super@@ visor and maintenance costs that are considered in accordance with the new calendar period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous lim@@ estone in 2011 / 2012 were still significantly under the current level . &quot;
&quot; Stein@@ häuser made clear that at the small dra@@ inage fall into the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; here , compl@@ ementary Schmidt , the market gener@@ als of great entertainment costs in the wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment has remained spar@@ ed over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the named systems will continue to be prec@@ arious for a period of stone houses , especially since one can not extend the supply of the se@@ wage @-@ purpose of Fries@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal around these systems , because it is a matter of deficit . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) , and the first about zero since October last year , considered a positive 0.2 % . &quot;
the annual stag@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the in@@ flow rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.3 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.3 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , the following groups of consumption observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6,@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotel ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices fell on clothing and foot@@ wear ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , appliances and routine ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in advance in alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature cri@@ tici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat tells that this filter is Ani@@ me @-@ inspired but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ vely compared to breeds .
&quot; with its filter tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily ups to change reality and play with identi@@ ties to such a way that the absurd as absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can transform herself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Lich@@ tenstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are distinctive , peculi@@ arity tools , which generate more than 30 million improved self @-@ adhesive per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps will reach the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn cri@@ ed in the past critic@@ isms that the app tac@@ kled black@@ face or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week of some people proposed a filter that gave them s@@ lit , false teeth and dismis@@ sed , some critics were a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow . &quot;
they asked if this repeti@@ tive contro@@ versy sur@@ rendered to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the rebellion have been widely used on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have the feature de@@ activated . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was regarded as hom@@ age to Ani@@ me characters and not as a caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; however , external standing , the r@@ ack@@ sm experienced , reminded of the filter at the vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
other rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose t@@ we@@ et were widely used over the photos that the filter &quot; hur@@ ting and c@@ eased was said uncomfortable . &quot;
&quot; she added that &quot; &quot; it was difficult to argue with the opposite position of a very contradic@@ tory Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot;
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ lo@@ assured , but that the money has been drawn into the ab@@ duc@@ tive extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ h@@ te .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diver@@ gence and integration , from meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are di@@ vul@@ tures in terms of race than their older counter@@ players - could rather go out of awareness of sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters created an image that for a user is miserable , &quot; so it &apos;s much harder that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was before the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to clear as a product management and engineer for medium , your Snap@@ chat account asked to clear others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that rac@@ use contro@@ versy can reflect a lack of diversity among the settings in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u cri@@ tici@@ zed the big part of white , only male leaders and ended up their appearance with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors , who are working there , but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as private companies .
&quot; on Thursday , there was Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently focused a personnel responsible , focusing on groups presented and in internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said in his turn , that she is closed to your Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask myself whether they need more users like us to say that this is not OK . &quot;
&quot; military leadership , ISIS &apos; intelligence information , represents the Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military domination of the United States Central Command changed news information to record an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called &quot; Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when used the actual conditions of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; preliminary Report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the dispute framework , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence services , reported how to changed its reference to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American Mil@@ ales in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news information that were typically sent by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , signed regularly a posi@@ ti@@ ent picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions were allowed on site and were more positive as analyses of other news services , quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , when poor analyses of our political leaders are presented , &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership error in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report provides detailed issues in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi Arm@@ ed Forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government tips led under Obama &apos;s instructions to change reports , it shows how an@@ al@@ ysts saw the pressure from their laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of the year 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , opinions and statements in front of the Congress clearly more positive than it represents the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com of relatives were publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sy already started in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic state . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ cs Congress of the K@@ ansas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the points of Central Command changed the news reports to play the danger through ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the Republi@@ can ri@@ ef@@ en the Task Force in life after they played that analy@@ st were worried about the mani@@ p@@ ulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed findings during the investigations .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Secretary of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
&quot; democratic members of the News report published on Thursday , published their own findings , with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of news alert to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi Security Council , Member of the Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. ship , known in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Ship , &quot; del@@ ayed the publication of news reports , &quot; ou@@ trag@@ ed the mor@@ als among an@@ al@@ ysts and &quot; gave over@@ ly little space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. By ship and Democrats have found no evidence on an input of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st for a &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; .
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by issu@@ ing by the General Secretary of the Pentagon , which were taken into complaints from Cent@@ Com Analy@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would be no reports of Congress , while the investigations of the General@@ ate would still be underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ting opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome the contro@@ versy of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have resign@@ ed back on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is meanwhile made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ orary estimates of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crises . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State remind you of more than ten years , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about the recommendations of many analy@@ st , only a small cre@@ ases in Iraq , and little time to turn on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in u@@ prising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team asked for Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to government agencies , that contrary to the statements made by the government of ill@@ um@@ ers had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terror group , as these pro @-@ vis@@ ational refin@@ ing could have taken into operation , to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ s Command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ tice because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the warri@@ or at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel replaces .
&quot; the USA winning fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; a day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday to India that the Americans have won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a thought@@ ful performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said it could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not among the people who keep their gates in memory .
but that knows them : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place that remain un@@ be@@ aten to Japan after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet up on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already been qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two within their group of six teams will each have the first and second place . &quot;
the first plat@@ ter will take a little longer out of the way that the other group lead .
&quot; as always the game may start on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex , four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania on , and had the first time with three years a hockey r@@ ack@@ et in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she was the most recent in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as she could not qualify for the K@@ ader .
then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham was named Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National Team , and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work of work in London that we now have .
we have the rest of the ro@@ ds can be removed .
&quot; on Thursday , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; India was gone to the game without a victory in the tournament into the game , but the team showed herself surprisingly strong , and held the play of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until the game took into their hands . &quot;
&quot; it accomplished a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left fl@@ anges , then moved to the center and l@@ up@@ ens the ball into the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
exactly like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and in@@ es@@ capable , a rapid eas@@ ing between competition and pursuit . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the oly@@ mp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning st@@ ab that will protect from the bracel@@ ets to swi@@ mmer for the Tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you can not switch the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the queue in the coffee shop , without about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games , and a women &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could certainly have been sent among these known names which were sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising if he would be a swi@@ mmer , Tur@@ ner or even F@@ genuine . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the oly@@ mp@@ ic tramp@@ oline for gold . &quot;
the oly@@ mp@@ ic flame is not illuminated every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized : air@@ brush , Arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and may reign it for a long time .
&quot; but if I might make hum@@ ble arguments for my particular love , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline has already been a oly@@ mp@@ ic event since 2000 , it had noticed since 2000 it was the last 16 years so much noticed that many that I asked , did not know that it is at all an Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the US Ath@@ l@@ eten sent to competition , there has never won a medal in the tramp@@ oline and until 2012 had made a athletes who made it to final dogs . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to see the prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ cks Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline has a certain outside char@@ me , partly because it sounds an enlight@@ ened ear for an un@@ enlight@@ ened ear for a cl@@ own@@ ing school as those for the Olympic Games sounds . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a refres@@ hed enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ oral potential - the cardi@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ m@@ bling of his never to end @-@ up - but also the Grazie of athle@@ tic and do@@ ves , the two sports , which combines it essentially . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; jumping winner jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( rotating , h@@ ens and o@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ apro@@ gram to execution , difficulty and &apos; flight time . &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women are compete against each other . &quot;
the common oly@@ mp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight .
&quot; medalli@@ sts must go further in their quest for gold , faster , to the top and dr@@ unk , sometimes to the destination , sometimes round and back to the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only chase the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the output wall , but in the television transfer also another height target : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pos@@ eful desire is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to sti@@ r even a vie@@ wers to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I want to look at the chance of these games as something fati@@ gu@@ ed .
&quot; of this , the tramp@@ oline offers an at@@ rop@@ ause . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ spr@@ ing@@ ers is above .
a upward movement is not the goal .
&quot; or she pr@@ all@@ t , seemingly he@@ avier like a astr@@ on@@ aut , goes to top , then back down , then effort@@ lessly back upwards . &quot;
&quot; here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves into the distance , just the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s such Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification round and final cleaning of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in stre@@ aming around 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will beam the final round as part of a afternoon blocks to both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to over@@ looked over@@ looked . &quot;
&quot; if the consciousness of consciousness can only be achieved by the att@@ acking and the lenses of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his after air rin@@ ks , new fan . &quot;

violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who are calling for political changes in Ethiopia as opposed to violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ ested during the cl@@ ashes with the police have been killed .
is Ethiopia precisely here to sum up ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid state of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in recent months protests against the government the country and grew up in more and more areas .
last week thousands of people on the streets and required fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses raised that polic@@ emen were shot in zig un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and rolls .
&quot; in the circulation of well @-@ being videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or early of this year , show how security of young people were hit with sticks while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the leader of the UN Agency for Human Rights is now calling for a further investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold up this country and in future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expands into a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dras@@ tically - there is a new p@@ end@@ ent in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia has anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organizations have introduced the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , and dis@@ si@@ ders were effective for silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and these no other options have except to protest , it breaks off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in Central America . &quot;
all the youth protest .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground @-@ use until the wor@@ ding in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Eritre@@ a ; a struggle for this delicate , controversial line called in June hundreds of lives . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts as the Oro@@ mo @-@ liberation front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been more or less imposed in recent years , which could benefit more or less . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bitter after years of getting rid of Hin@@ kö@@ ch@@ el@@ ns under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media , as cheap smartphones have been more frequent and improved the Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the Government sets access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially for protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies to hide where they stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave them that they gathered so at prot@@ otypes .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ es in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since the ann@@ ons of the Am@@ har@@ as , the Am@@ har@@ as , which are mainly due to Christian highlands , in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are living and in low@@ land @-@ areas . &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are able to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray that constitute about 6 percent of the population , which are dominant in the military services , in trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former vine leader , was up to his death on a failed disease in 2012 17 years ago Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think of corners . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in it to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special officers to process opponents and make them harmful .
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ians of new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively in@@ scr@@ utable reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray control services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time you lived such a tur@@ mo@@ il and lived in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ esters , according to the data of analy@@ zes , was apparently stolen by the government and were subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following raid , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in recent months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts , Ethiop@@ ians are leaders for their vision@@ aries infrastructure , such as the new pen@@ it@@ ator , as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month of attacked protest in gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ische town , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hat@@ red opposite the Tig@@ ray becomes more common in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the protests in the USA and other Western allies can put into a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ ym on the neigh@@ b@@ oured Somalia , even if they recently pointed out that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; during the West , he clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his exile in a already vol@@ ati@@ ful area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp declares his sentence Obama has been established &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ versy , which surrounds his campaign by sending that his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fying new questions about the communication skills of the presidential data of the Republi@@ can , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings its co @-@ raising , who will endeavour to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain to the owner &apos;s own position , which he could not meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having made the clear@@ ing event of a campaign event on mit@@ tw@@ och@@ re , Mr Tru@@ mp in relation to the statement on Thursday and existed in interviews that he really did not intended to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tru@@ mp , he is simply s@@ ark@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , at which Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant completely serious . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator H@@ ugh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp also wanted to weak@@ en the testimony something to weak@@ en it that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , the Republi@@ can presidential did@@ did@@ at does not want to know about it . &quot;
the last storm of the cri@@ tic to Mr. Tru@@ mp is down while he is trying to direct the focus of his campaign for random or@@ iting values .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried again to return to this topic .
&quot; on Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself , when he said , the Russians should be Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons of emails , but explained later &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then return to ruin .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans , as they arrive , and then you may choose &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of fighting the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted an even estimated sound , since its revers@@ al values have gone back . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was released on Friday , a tour with a big lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he accused his critics frequently to dec@@ eive his statements or to understand his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he focuses on the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze brought his loyal fellow to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s celeb@@ rates , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani therefore said to the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s statements , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost un@@ familiar , small organization , he called them back@@ bone , totally wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstre@@ am Republi@@ can try to argue that the Government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an external Minister , ISIS allowed to expand to expand the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them out before , on each of his words , and be taken up against him . &quot;
&quot; he desp@@ ised the &quot; poor , &quot; Flemish &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; you cannot do it ! &quot;
some of the Democrats have been sorry for Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s as only a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once upon the price of the market is pushed , Café in Green@@ point comes back . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a har@@ big@@ ine cafe in Williamsburg , in which one could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years for good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , due to the prices of its Bedford Avenue shop front . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the Ver@@ b in summer 2014 er@@ ased , sold soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people consuming it as the last loss in a GM@@ O town .
&quot; the artist in Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap @-@ shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , it is also new making . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ bel@@ ated Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ time staff of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
&quot; when he offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ outside , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept much at . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ som@@ al model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verse .
&quot; but Rodri@@ guez said , that he also wanted to experiment . &quot;
he led new ingredients .
on the menu sand@@ wich@@ es with bac@@ on and cheese and there are y@@ ni@@ es such as cap@@ aci@@ ers and aci@@ zed oni@@ ons .
there are natur@@ als .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh fruit juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months Rodri@@ guez , Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old tri@@ bal . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also lab@@ eled by prizes from Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , dwelt in Williamsburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way up . &quot;
&quot; after leaving was closed , she gave a while the coffee table , she said . &quot;
&quot; I realized it was clear that it was the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b that fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they dro@@ wns they again coffee , even if they ordered on this day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai tea that is another new supplement . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal had been another long @-@ term and loyal customer since the beginning of 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered inev@@ itably always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ guez said , he wanted to experiment , and add new ingredients into the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ dre@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he does not have a Gro@@ ll about it that the rop@@ es business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to produce a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ baked coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go back to her offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the Café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the carte menu and Rodri@@ guez , that he has to put it soon , so that its new neighbours will feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has further advantages .
a local splan@@ ts wants to fill the cold baked coffee in bottles and sell them .
there is a chance that the café is expanded on an alert building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was magni@@ fied and said that he was destroyed on the ground as the café closed .
&quot; once the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said the bed of the Lok@@ as and the bri@@ ghten a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to cra@@ wl , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as an enemy @-@ ecker President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt a Fai@@ ble for sophisticated delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water@@ tor@@ tie soup .
&quot; his menu on this day was slightly hum@@ ble : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , Kartoff@@ el@@ p@@ ü@@ ree and as dessert a p@@ ud@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with leading people , &quot; &quot; Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ an .
&quot; co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was attended by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about living in a residential home on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest cooperation , &quot; An decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine while the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ por@@ ter in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ au@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em Im@@ bis@@ s at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ O crash . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh c@@ utter with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetables . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ por@@ ter Hack@@ br@@ ats ordered , this found the pair of discussion on food in the era of great depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was cru@@ el@@ uss@@ bro@@ t , liver and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and some Bil@@ lig@@ ent who stretched the ingredient .
imagine how many Erd@@ nuts have to eat that they serve them as dinner .
co@@ gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have put itself in the stomach as a lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , a all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women co@@ iled for male field workers and it was served fresh baked Past@@ els for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent to hungry Europeans during the first World War food . &quot; a Square &quot; &quot; stands out the paths to which the country went through , no longer the s@@ ar@@ ming country . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense was the new Bud@@ get@@ away : mysterious food such as Br@@ ote and Kas@@ ser@@ ollen were re@@ trac@@ ted to stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ ene as a &quot; wonderful way , &quot; mer@@ ging Zi@@ egel@@ man , since Kö@@ che C@@ losing ingredients were hidden under a creative sau@@ ce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dr@@ agon@@ ies .
meat that was the centre of American cuisine has become a rare luxury .
&quot; peculi@@ ar mix@@ tures have been tried , since a cal@@ orie and balanced satisfaction has had priority to taste or even healthy cooking . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , or@@ ship a dish of this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ el butter , too . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man leads further off : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PE@@ TA butter and baked oni@@ ons does not fit together .
it was typical for many of the business recipes .
&quot; as never before , before , exagger@@ ation - including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country such as such . &quot;
&quot; published by the Reci@@ pes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to transform their household policy and the challenge to transform Pamp@@ e like cre@@ m@@ ish sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports of the response of the government to the hungry citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he openly praised the simple Io@@ wa farmers living in his kitchen , he was like the millions of millions of world , to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked Continental kitchen like fish with guru @-@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was great real@@ ism .
&quot; President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have called him to stat@@ ate him with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , that led to a house@@ ke@@ eper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt that the White House brought out the boring food in Washington but also one of the most decent food preparations . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , with food handle , was rejected once the land came back onto the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is based on our advanced focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple was better understood during writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans mother @-@ in mother - for example they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a true fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; she really did ill . &quot;
there was the wind attack .
&quot; after the t@@ eller at Eis@@ enberg &apos;@@ s were vac@@ ated , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ough of Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that there was a common trick , hum@@ ble recipes to send a message . &quot;
&quot; there was no p@@ oured cream , only pl@@ ough@@ s , sugar , water and c@@ inn@@ amon . &quot;
&quot; everyone turned something rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a spo@@ on in the tough , brown limb@@ s . &quot;
surprisingly enough it was not bad .
co@@ e pick up three times a rash .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few ch@@ opped Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed attack : he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o
he sat his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old even died in a sec@@ bom@@ bs assault of the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil @-@ defence group , which according to the paper @-@ newspaper until almost 6@@ 0,000 people have saved life . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 Volunte@@ ers put her own life on the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses , and to provide first aid in the war @-@ area . &quot;
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civil wine , which shows him with a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house , went to the world . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans to illumin@@ ate symbol@@ ism in the Gre@@ ys of War .
&quot; but as heroes he never saw himself , according to the picture : &quot; &quot; for me , that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; if I want to save life , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar itself came to an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b attack in Syria . &quot;
&quot; helic@@ opter have rejected four fac@@ bom@@ bs over the Alzheimer &apos;s district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we eliminate the toxic remains of the bom@@ b , so that not children play with it , &quot; the image c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Grön@@ land : the oldest sp@@ inal is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land ha@@ ie usually come only in winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the Star@@ ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with good a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to the present day .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie got only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; while the Greenland works along the ground of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it is on average just 1.@@ 220 meters far . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five metre long animal speeds up to 2,@@ 6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
but this of long @-@ lon@@ eliness of life seems to be a patent for a high age .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate of a Greenland , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ ün@@ lein by the Max Plan@@ ck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life span that means for sp@@ ans a world record . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolution of evolution has been long since Greenland become rocky . &quot;
only lacking the evidence .
&quot; Greenland ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea before the thin@@ ly populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they dive on the surface mostly only in winter . &quot;
about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie know researchers in accordance with little .
her tim@@ est@@ op@@ ent@@ emp@@ o moder@@ ation it when they were six animals with a transm@@ itter .
&quot; loo@@ t make this shar@@ ks yet , in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the rem@@ n@@ ants of a ro@@ be , another had the pine no@@ p@@ ses of a young iron . &quot;
possibly they chase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek cad@@ aver that from higher water layers down to the bottom .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 5@@ 02 cen@@ timeters measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , analy@@ zes them with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens of the shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ id occurs already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , that the proteins contained in it will be no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
&quot; therefore , their birth should be lying after the early 19@@ 60s , when the nuclear weapons attempt greater amounts of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in which with 220 cen@@ timet@@ res in length of third animal , the Lin@@ sen@@ sei remains a low level of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , so it might have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie had a normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , which arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeters long Greenland a age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k might even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ females first got off last night , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length could arrange an age . &quot;
&quot; as one of the animals have been determined with 3@@ 92 cen@@ timeters on the cus@@ p of the sexually mature and his age of 156 years was determined , Grön@@ land with the multip@@ lication was obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
also this might be the most likely for ver@@ teb@@ rates of the world .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is not acci@@ dental .
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Grön@@ land w@@ al , in whose sp@@ eck on N@@ acken a 120 years old Har@@ der tip , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism is still running the animals of the animals living there . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to warm up in the cold water , the animals are often particularly big . &quot;
&quot; for the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal gets heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is so dangerous and should focus on it as soon as possible as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , a very large animal should rather invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
floor @-@ floor in a double @-@ pack
&quot; with themes around the building , the community at the most recent session has been addressed . &quot;
&quot; with relief the panel took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the younger dwell@@ ings may begin . &quot;
&quot; after the property , par@@ cel@@ li@@ zation and authorisation questions could be clari@@ fied and the moti@@ ons of the measurement could be placed , the sale of the properties in the residential areas &quot; &quot; path &quot; &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ strasse - Sel@@ f@@ ist section 1 ) , is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the streams of land @-@ bro@@ oks are equally respected in the rural and quiet residential area .
&quot; as it was meant , they can log up immediately at the City Hall , on the delivery of plots , the par@@ amount is expected to advise in his September meeting . &quot;
&quot; to also change requests to the settlement of other commercial enterprises , connected to creation of jobs , loss of the congreg@@ ations , newly established in the spring of this year , to change the plan plan in part @-@ areas in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the field of under@@ time there is already proven business @-@ area around two plots in the direction of State 2112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the City of the Main , therefore , in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxemburg experienced the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am benef@@ ited most from the Bre@@ xit V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of Excellence , financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses are further developed from financial transactions to the entire EU . &quot;
so far for the so @-@ called EU Pass you have to pay the approval in Britain until now .
this is just using big U.S. banks .
several banks have already announced their jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ Association of Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; has been calculated five years with 10000 new jobs in the Main .
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area is united as well as further important authorities as the European insurance coverage EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial industry than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the database is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg also insist on a large fund industry , cutting edge as well as Dublin as Dublin as Dublin as Dublin . &quot;

&quot; at the Seine , the rental property also has 50 per cent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of corporate consulting Mer@@ cer , the city is available in place seven , Luxembourg on position 19 , Dublin on position 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7. place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life be a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt was able to attract further banks and investors . &quot;
&quot; but London will remain in spite of the Bre@@ xit vote on the most important financial centre in Europe , my economic for@@ ear@@ chers . &quot;
&quot; to this also speak the power conditions : in London worked according to numbers from Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the ban@@ ker industry , in Frankfurt it were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;

cl@@ int@@ ons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % Bundes@@ control
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton released on Friday its tax statement for 2015 , this revealed for the presidential did@@ atin of Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Bundes@@ tax rate of 34,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Cl@@ int@@ ons USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly on the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton had an income of USD 3 million by the Verlag Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for her book about her term of office in the State Department . &quot;

they paid an effective Bundes@@ tax rate of 20,@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards with regard to financial transparency , &quot; &quot; gave Cl@@ int@@ ons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion known . &quot;
&quot; in a cr@@ ush opposite to this , Donald Tru@@ mp are hidden behind the wrong way and returns with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential data to publish their tax missions , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
Tru@@ mp , a New York busin@@ es@@ sman , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for denial , a control of tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Cl@@ int@@ ons elect@@ oral campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential formation of Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special advis@@ ers , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax insp@@ ections are not finished . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential did@@ at of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already missed out that his anger have issues relating to assets , his donations for charitable organisations , its divisions and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already folded on the subject and published on Friday a video on the Internet in which high @-@ level republi@@ cans Tru@@ mp are calling for his tax statement .
on Thursday she spoke the issue also during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he refused to do what any other presidential did@@ at has done in the last decades , and publish its control statements . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has not paid any or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a economic journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax evasion and tax advice , the statements that still could be the case . &quot;
federal control has become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ et that people would pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal also .
&quot; during a election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton spent last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ et@@ glomer@@ ate his seat here , Tru@@ mp to a meeting on whose taxes . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ et said , he was likewise subjected to a control of the IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp &quot; fear &quot; against voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;

&quot; the tax statement of the cl@@ int@@ ons of 2015 showed that this only refers to USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike the majority of all Americans . &quot;

Jewish director proposes Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots ent@@ angl@@ ed a media watch , after having betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pres@@ election as it would have been requested to have an employee according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; sent his anger at Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by giving an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried Israel to find Israel at the pres@@ op@@ tionally list of the hotel .
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a way to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; &quot; looked upon him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel told that the measure is an &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason , the reason behind it was , delet@@ es in the director even more melanchol@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they have demanded that the election is deleted , the accused of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli amb@@ assador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ trading sman called this a &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and troubled .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
&quot; the fact that this in Germany has worn exactly this hotel chain , is even a greater shame . &quot;
this does not require explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
&quot; the incident , a fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet , in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some under@@ gone the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been the alleged to have been settled by the alleged &quot; Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; ash@@ amed of you , it was called in another post , in which it was noted that the hotel , which is situated on the cl@@ assy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , close to a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all the accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident , &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , tells the mirror . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a direct statement , Israel would not be able to record the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increased to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade approach between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an annual to 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest in the Russian company grew strongly in shops in the country , divided the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further commercial l@@ ends is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he noted that trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 , increase and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent spr@@ int and amo@@ unted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the commercial down@@ turn was achieved by deliveries of machines , landing vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot;
&quot; D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , Russian foreign accounts were about 35.@@ 000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , an Iranian citizen . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries that affects the number of tourist destinations in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record figures ir@@ ate tourists in Russia last year , broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that hopes to change from the amb@@ assador . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the towns Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Sh@@ ir@@ az and Y@@ az@@ d , who received Monum@@ ents of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition . &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the male team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to f@@ ame as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ chor@@ us , which had made his Land@@ smann Sir Chris Ho@@ y had turned into his own . the J@@ y and made the legend proud to have a victory for the favourites in New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olymp@@ ag@@ old@@ med@@ a@@ illen . &quot;
they repeated the trick after they took place in March by train World Championships in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys only one hum@@ ble sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a Hin@@ des .
Ho@@ ys retired be@@ got a gap , the ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton attempted to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man , with whom they remained , when they saw the potential in the vill@@ i , that has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner sat in the qualification round a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but won the New Zealand in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ des was almost back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a large part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ des in a higher course was driving to slow it slow and to give it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as an BBC expert , and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des upon , when they were on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name for me .
we have been placed in the final dogs a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph , 2012 on the side Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys gave us that he fell on the train after a weak start . &quot;
he moved this statement later and there was no objection of English Rival .
&quot; with such an amazing victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; It feels with all the UK fl@@ ags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; we have come so badly with so many world titles , that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven of 10 titles were obtained both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if the bar@@ ometer of our progress has been in the last five months , that we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of Pos@@ sible that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three oly@@ mp@@ ic gold medals in a contest . &quot;
&quot; this would be born for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( apparently native date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a ej@@ ection of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the che@@ eses of Ho@@ y is equal .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which today begins and go over three days . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment .
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; If he wins two other gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medalli@@ sts of the day but there were other good news for England .
Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ erer @-@ four kilometers . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world record , which won in London gold was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) is held today on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with safety in the focus . &quot;
he suffered yesterday with en@@ voy before the qualification as it functions to be ri@@ ef@@ ly to measure his body size .
&quot; in the same women &apos;s competition , the morning continues and ends , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura f@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie archives soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World tre@@ k@@ ord@@ era in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team leaves itself to be a strong train team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a ch@@ ar to medals .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London have gone down the expectations for Rio .
&quot; in the background , Dr@@ amas played in the background , as the resign@@ ation of the Technical Leit@@ er Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of Sex@@ ismus@@ - and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ ers as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite afterwards as the legendary reputation of GB@@ s , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment . &quot;
future of mel@@ ting of Port@@ land on account of lifting the energy supply
&quot; the future of aluminum arrows of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are standing on the game , since the plant operators announce the energy supplier , and thus raising all delivery contracts , as the delivered energy company will be applied . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years of permanent subsidies is going on in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the area of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land stand on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk during a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ating effect , since the mel@@ ight uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ zer@@ ei , which led last year at a closing of the angl@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risky a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and finally due to the weekly basis for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which is supplying great aluminium allo@@ ping with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the multi @-@ owned property of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which Chinese companies C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L is assum@@ ing that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ight means &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L still said that the agreements called &quot; &quot; backup &quot; &quot; will have to come into force from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts will have a 12 @-@ month period of cancellation , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this , AG@@ L is assum@@ ing that the contracts in the financial year 17 are contributing to the revenue , &quot; said the electricity supplies . &quot;
all potential implications for the revenues on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong schedul@@ ing markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L shared with that the value of the contracts entered into the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; expectation of cancellation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the agreements concluded , the &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; &quot; the mel@@ ting to operate or to ensure the power to the mel@@ t@@ ment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company said that there has been a 20 year @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should enter into force of November this year , even though it is not yet a statement of why it has resign@@ ed from the contract . &quot;
analy@@ tic war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the sector before the possible closure of the Port@@ land Sch@@ mel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility close to Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the an@@ al@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land spends approximately 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; Strom@@ market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set , that would not be good . &quot;
&quot; more than just a card@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the Cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ing of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ omin@@ ator , 20 , Model and fourth subsidiary of the management and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ ps C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ ing of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand amb@@ assador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York completed the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , bringing me the sight of this co@@ vers to wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the revelations of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre body ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ y family , which has been forgotten by Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ al ) , as it ends the cover of their sister and ends with a classical turn : you all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this presents the cl@@ ot &apos;s act virtually every Birth@@ day of a children &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the proposition , &quot; &quot; You should have forgotten it ? &quot; , &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon ground at 8 am in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to participate her other girls somehow in this journ@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the Sept@@ ember@@ ed of the Vo@@ gue , the Vo@@ gue has started a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ om great sister Kim likes it , what the Vo@@ gue Cover is concerned ( her and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September magazine is a League for himself . &quot;
the September @-@ edition is the most sold for Vo@@ gue on the most recent issue of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , which resem@@ bles rather a picture band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , from the 8@@ 32 pages of the city center 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is so worth seeing , that during the last two years images of the magazine can still be crossed out before the official announ@@ cements . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ rities , the Model@@ ing &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ rities are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar @-@ awar@@ de@@ e and Di@@ or @-@ brand amb@@ assador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ den@@ omin@@ ator is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of its generation - under the previous category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or Reality stars or young people of today who know how to get a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true for mon@@ den@@ omin@@ ator ) .
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like this success . &quot;
with their Reality @-@ TV @-@ story J@@ enn@@ ers was always something tense in the fashion world .
in June the &quot; Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ den@@ omin@@ ator and their colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her &quot; the Mist@@ y of the eyel@@ id . &quot;
these feelings returned once again as the message with the show J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but to walk on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to go on the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ den@@ omin@@ ator is on the cover of the Sept@@ em@@ ite of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold out from her painted pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine .
and in her free time she is seen in the Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centers : 16@@ 0.000 people per year
&quot; more than 160,000 of the aid centers of the country are rejected annually by the municipal law centres , while the industry is based on the effects of other medi@@ ations on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , aid workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just delic@@ acy and similar products - in their search for free legal advice and legal advice . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ crowded , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centers are more than 30 percent of its federal states will lose . &quot;
&quot; the Director of the Par@@ dre@@ ad centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municip@@ al centres , revealed that thousands of people will be rejected each year . &quot;
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only become worse without lifting the state of the federal government .
&quot; Queens@@ lands community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and de@@ pressing debts , families who were dismis@@ sed by parti@@ tions - all these people have problems of legal kind and this survey revealed that they can not get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will cut funds for 30 percent in June 2017 , meaning that thousands of help people from Queensland are forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call for the Gener@@ ate General and Federal Minister , as well as Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these medi@@ ums immediately so that people may need help they need in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the provincial government filled its commitment to up@@ lift funds on national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now at the time to look at the needs of the community centres and its customer communities , as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government in this important work . &quot;

&quot; the incident will be described in a indic@@ t@@ ment , which was submitted on Wednesday at the Landes@@ court of Charlotte through Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini was on to have been waiting for months , that the affair would be regulated internally before it re@@ alized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;

&quot; weapons do not need to be de@@ duc@@ ted to set up damage , &quot; &quot; Bord@@ ini &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4th ) , and Berlin ( 18 September ) have a significant loss for government parties and CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; this representative representative of the opinion research institutes IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government of government in the north could be farther , this is not possible after the re@@ organisation in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both Bundes@@ länder , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus could have good chances to continue to face the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD passed from 35,@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to pol@@ l , the party saw only shortly before the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disp@@ uted between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left cheese on 19 percent ( formerly 18,@@ 4 per cent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens despite mild losses with 6 percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 percent ) again into the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent in the country .
&quot; according to Berlin deport@@ ations , the SPD of the survey is still limited to 23 percent ( election in 2011 : 28,@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they saw them behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17,@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the field of parliament .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return to miss the pirates in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ l@@ upe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer lived a disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed almost a half kilo@@ grams and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty kno@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was in the beginning eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would reach today for about two professionals with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gig@@ abyte .
&quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros you can buy the devices still on the Internet , but they are somehow from the St@@ one@@ age of the dormit@@ ory . &quot;
20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the Computer@@ messe C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the west @-@ format &quot; .
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the sense of communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to websites was possible by HTML @-@ browser , as well as agon@@ izing . &quot;
&quot; a tor@@ rech@@ ner was available , a digital addres@@ book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be turned similar to a laptop . &quot;
then there was a little keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; rather proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was at 3@@ 92 Euro .
no one could be in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator of the beginning of the smartphone era would be .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the phone number of Finn@@ s experienced a unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and wrapped at Microsoft . &quot;
the market domin@@ ates the market today which came all a lot later than Nokia .
&quot; always , and everywhere , this is today for a lot of people everyday life . &quot;
2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.@@ 4 billion devices have been sold to Samsung and Apple exp@@ ire about 555 million pieces .
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; to do this , the well @-@ running shops of the countless App providers and telecommunications companies . &quot;
around the smartphone has become an entire industry in the meantime .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in the beginning of 2007 , then the Apple Chef Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communications , all per touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , which controlled the market , had the offspring . &quot;
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
now Apple and Asian providers now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention a matter of course .
in the inc@@ ision every Germans look at the day 88 times a day on its mobile phone .
&quot; we have to learn all to put away the smartphone even by Jan@@ ina ball , responsible in the Siemens @-@ Board of Staff . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered as a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must guide the oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw is not only in our local commun@@ es and throughout London but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
&quot; for me , that presented the biggest attraction in He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the playing . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will achieve again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities we will be able to create 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport area . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big . &quot;
&quot; I was told that England never will be ready for the games , and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage . &quot;
the two @-@ fl@@ ee had w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to the overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any given question . &quot;
how the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in swe@@ ating growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs to leave the airport as well as in the whole GB . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion @-@ ures infrastructure investments in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in consequence to the world &apos;s best airport enter@@ minal was built up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequencies of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time that we direct this oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw along with our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of the UK .

&quot; for companies who earn money with online money come according to one of the software manufacturers experiments , indicator @-@ block , a &quot; &quot; cross and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would be ad flo@@ cked on his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side , published Ad@@ block Plus a blog@@ post where users may update their filters in the program to once again block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the en@@ coding regarding his advertisements , in order to detect the ad lock@@ ers , which is part of the page advertising is to complain . &quot;
&quot; yet , Ad@@ block proclaimed that there has been a new way to deal with the new codes . &quot;
&quot; in a blog@@ post , the spokes@@ man wrote of Ad@@ block Ben Williams that &quot; &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the simultaneous open source community and the ch@@ anting has already been underway since the invention of ad flo@@ wering community and that it &apos;s possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world @-@ world @-@ largest company has left into battle for social media , is a strong Indi@@ gen@@ ous indication for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people are using ad flo@@ wering ; almost four times a lot of 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with twenty billions of active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , hand @-@ value 84 per cent of the adverti@@ sers took on fac@@ ebook . &quot;
&quot; the company has shown it on display systems on desktop PCs , since mobile ad lock does not mobile effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , divided a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a enough large proportion of revenues , so that Facebook seems to be an investment of such a step as re@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would be upgraded to update the &quot; &quot; ad prize &quot; &quot; to have more control over them on them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook , that Ad@@ blocks would be worrying new filters because they would also block content on the site , which are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this does not represent positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , distributed a speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;

Mrs with suspected su@@ ic@@ ide on Swiss motorway over@@ ride
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses after having a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a suspected su@@ ic@@ ide by several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman put themselves in the Dark Ones in an act of despair , &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Schwei@@ zer@@ im at the age of 49 , that was gone by several vehicles , including a burden of trucks , even to kill themselves . &quot;
she died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified ; the police , which , as well as any witnesses of the incident , to report to un@@ subscribe . &quot;
&quot; it was opened an investigation process , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - when a person ran into the Dark Ones on the highway - was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a ped@@ est@@ ri@@ ans run in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
&quot; last year a polic@@ eman of the casual pottery was acqu@@ itted after having over@@ ride a man and killed , who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had dr@@ unk , and has become unconscious on the road . &quot;
&quot; the court noted that the poli@@ tic@@ ist -- which had responded to an emergency manner -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should register with the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ dell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhabited according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ d@@ ells .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could be raised with their hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once er@@ d@@ ingly conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere , and still slow . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ating the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to he@@ ap life and in front of the dark . &quot;
&quot; early Venus prof@@ ited also from a sun , which was 30 percent matter . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simul@@ ations exp@@ ires the slow turn of Venus its night@@ mare the sun almost two months long , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this warm@@ ed the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which affects the surface of a large number of sun heat . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution , the previously thought by Plan@@ etary Research . &quot;
&quot; although it was probably inhabited , Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ so much heat and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light were exposed . &quot;
&quot; their oceans , di@@ spar@@ ed and their water v@@ ap@@ pers was burned from the ultr@@ avi@@ olet light . &quot;
as their hydro@@ chl@@ oric acid only remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ d@@ ells at Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the star@@ ring of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ sh@@ tel@@ esc@@ ope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates below the stars of the star &apos;s Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars in star enh@@ ances are to different edges and in which context , the rotation time @-@ time rooms are standing with the planets . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we see through the compar@@ isons of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ ring of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this star run , which emerged before approximately 125 million years ago , reaching an adult . &quot;
it is now on the fastest .
at top rates of peak rates encounter large amounts of star@@ ches .
&quot; since this win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a bre@@ wed effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; if a star is alter@@ t , its rotation begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by demonstrating the time between the appear of a disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble star ch@@ equ@@ es -- like sun @-@ st@@ ains --
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more intense stars revol@@ ved more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ters as smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ball@@ et &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ aden we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star@@ ring of the Ple@@ j@@ ades so close is , it serves as an ideal cosm@@ opolitan laboratory to compare qualities as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ ring of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers a anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still much ahead of us what we like to learn more about how , W@@ ann and why stars slo@@ w@@ down their red rates down and speak to her &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in three times in detail about their latest analysis of the Rot@@ ary rates of Pl@@ ei@@ ades , which will soon appear at the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star occurs
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US Bas@@ eball star Star in best days from base to base .
&quot; after his emotional return notice , the 41 year old pro will carry on 12 August against the Tampa Bay R@@ ays a last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; to both the 14 @-@ Mal@@ ly All @-@ Star @-@ Game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature under a tenth year deal with him since 2007 27 million US dollars .
&quot; until the end of the contrast , on 31 December 2017 , he serves as a consultant and youth coach - in full sal@@ ary . &quot;
as a player it paid for a long time with power .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
&quot; but in the retirement hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be recorded . &quot;
&quot; for as successful Rodri@@ guez - Nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; - on the field was , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; already 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; had been abandoned at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked up to the end of 2014 for 211 games by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main , for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in south @-@ Florida @-@ promoting resources . &quot;
after a dispute the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez then south@@ wards . &quot;
also his far@@ ewell days have not gone .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games get once the big stage had to sit Rodri@@ guez frequently on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include a far@@ ewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez got married , who was married with the actress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and actress Kate is said , sympathy con@@ und@@ esi@@ ons of fans from the Y@@ ank@@ ee arch@@ al Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
we want A @-@ Rod &quot; s@@ angen the p@@ endant at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez @-@ Team .
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first D@@ op@@ ters
knowing : because of a positive D@@ op@@ ing rehear@@ sal - weight@@ ed Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio not launch .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ tic waste .
a caught ath@@ l@@ ete would have won almost one medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition , the first official no@@ op@@ ters have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ s. in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles from Bulgaria and Polish weights , Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the anyway critical athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to un@@ time . &quot;
&quot; for Ch@@ en was already proven last Sunday the Di@@ ure@@ tik@@ um hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de , which is used as a mascul@@ ini@@ zing means for dop@@ amine . &quot;
the International Sport@@ forum CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the finale over 100 m butter@@ fly , only by 0.@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the pre@@ h@@ ops over 50 m of open style .
Ch@@ en has applied the opening of the B @-@ sample during the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) .
&quot; the national trade union take the matter &quot; very seriously and asks by Ch@@ en full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ forum CAS and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the sanctions of the sports@@ men with positive cases . &quot;
also during the night of Rio le@@ aded the message about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa through the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act in the bot@@ tom@@ less substance around the blood @-@ offering EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been provisional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w en@@ acted immediately with criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men did not pull the right conclusions , &quot; said : &quot; we Bulgar@@ s are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , some weight of weight may not take part in the chron@@ ically offering @-@ offering nation in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; was also known as the London Olympi@@ ans in class up to 85 kg as his brother Tomas@@ z has been positive due to the an@@ dis@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both openly deny the intake , both may not be started in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
in front of the start of athle@@ tics there is particularly the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
&quot; the World Association I@@ A@@ AF had the complete Russian team to an exception because of the systematic D@@ op@@ ings to the start , even the L@@ ords Kenya was produced in Rio numerous bad news . &quot;
in the swimming pool there were also the earlier Ver@@ sions in China for fier@@ ce disputes between the athletes .
thus the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t made the Chinese Olympi@@ ans Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of open style , I want to commit myself , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun also stood at the center of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positive in the Chinese champi@@ on@@ ships positive to the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit in three months . &quot;
dat@@ kl@@ au : as per@@ fi@@ de er@@ press h@@ acker their ran@@ som
programmer at Re@@ yn@@ ungs @-@ Mal@@ ware are currently targeted companies - and we are successful .
&quot; according to a current survey of the mal@@ ware @-@ defense specialists in Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany have been at least 40 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months at least once , partly numerous victims of a attack with black@@ outs software . &quot;
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware ext@@ or@@ tion .
&quot; 40 percent of the victims paid out by the offen@@ ders , in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators Speci@@ alize their Er@@ pres@@ ser @-@ Software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; they are successful there , the potentially ingredient ran@@ som is clearly higher than in private use . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re currently monitoring a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertisement advertising . &quot;
then discovered the perpet@@ rators of creators software for themselves .
&quot; only were private use the goal , but the change to company reg@@ att@@ acking took place in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on the computer &apos;s computer is active , it looks for quite long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ o or database files as well as to archives photos and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of the pres@@ et .
&quot; to get the final turn @-@ key code to the files , the victims must pay money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where in terms of private users the personal photo @-@ database is at stake , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production stands still . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage comes from when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German firms affected by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break the business completely , in one case people were in life danger . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , numerous hospitals have already been threatened by attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of ambulance . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : does not pay , you therefore promotes the problem &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay their data . &quot;
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in operation .
the h@@ acker again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety for@@ scher of F @-@ Secure the user surfaces and contact with the pres@@ pres@@ ets are examined and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they are explaining their sacrific@@ ing by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set freely accessible support sites or de@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and they will rede@@ em individuals after payments of a few hundred billion , companies need to negotiate hard and pay five st@@ elli@@ ge tot@@ als to return their data . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risky winn@@ ings from the Ran@@ som@@ ware Er@@ press@@ ors , the h@@ acker is always professional and sharing the work , explains security exper@@ te Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from Anti@@ virus provider Sophos , &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within one week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , however , is that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their claim software then in the form of a software buil@@ ders to the actual em@@ pres@@ ser .
&quot; the existing mal@@ ware @-@ kits created by the mal@@ ware , advice and additional tools purchased for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is a adaptation tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and brand@@ ing can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the pres@@ et are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the fresh software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; one is therefore log@@ ged in one of the forums in the underground , purchases the set of a crimin@@ als and asked another way to install the software on as many PCs . &quot;
the payment is made per un@@ processed calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually bear the crimin@@ als then sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies which provide their data better .
over 50 percent of companies @-@ IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be rep@@ lic@@ ated by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data is not sufficient for successful issu@@ ing more , the perpet@@ rators brought up with the publication of sensitive data such as customer list or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ ski . &quot;
the damage potential depending on the type of data is still higher than before .
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators could continue to take a completely new goals on the internet of things to go . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security for@@ scher , as they could have been using the Internet using ther@@ m@@ stat under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the outdoor heating of such a block heating might be quite a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the do@@ ers then instead of heating in the future will block a whole production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in the Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday .
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V has been rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , just the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls down there . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage space .
&quot; it is not just a trunk of 45@@ 3 l up to high @-@ up and 10@@ 26 l down , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , when it sounds : the sitting area of the back bank can be high @-@ valves and offer storage space , which is high from floor up to blankets 1.@@ 24 m . &quot;
&quot; the trunk is well loaded , however the load @-@ height with 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up to HR @-@ V thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful .
&quot; however , his work is likely to do something qui@@ eter . &quot;
encouraging is the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another motor ization : a 1.5 @-@ l gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a little direct .
the decor leaves in the tested top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes open .
&quot; among the safety systems , the City of Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ Assi@@ ent ( works up to pace 32 ) , the coll@@ ision war@@ system and the don@@ or assistant . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ ns sometimes , because he is rated many obstacles in the Ran@@ ger than &quot; her@@ b@@ ann@@ ah@@ ent objects . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works for the remote @-@ assist@@ ent .
and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ ters re@@ acts to the traffic detection and d@@ ros@@ selt when needed the speed .
&quot; but full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , receives the gas@@ oline from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ waste norm .
&quot; with HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : over@@ throwing on air @-@ bridge
a Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passengers .
&quot; for a liability is conceivable only in danger , typical of air traffic , argu@@ ed the Ober@@ land@@ es@@ court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the r@@ ack@@ et had broken down in the overthrow a knee @-@ pit .
&quot; however , the accident could however happen everywhere - it is a general lifestyle , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
disease cases : when paid the organizer
&quot; dear holi@@ day@@ makers , after their trip only get money back , if the cause of the disease is dubi@@ ous freely in the hotel . &quot;
this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests raised the same symptoms .
in the twi@@ sted case a family was hard on the second day of her Tur@@ qu@@ or@@ ur@@ lau@@ bs heavy to diar@@ rho@@ ea and cr@@ ashing .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
&quot; their condition led the holi@@ day@@ makers to a def@@ ective clarification , which alleg@@ edly fought the sea@@ water poll@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; the family was the view , which was not a lack of travel - and cl@@ oned against the organizer . &quot;
&quot; before , the r@@ acqu@@ et had no success . &quot;
although the frac@@ ture was actually def@@ ective .
but the organizer was just shortly before departure from the r@@ ack@@ et .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his inform@@ ational obligations , so the judgment . &quot;
especially in the samples of the water no contamination have been found .
&quot; the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ red by infection , among each other - belonging to the general lifestyle . &quot;
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 points .
&quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , according to the violence of violence in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state kis@@ sed and decided to react at the same time on the terrorist attack .
it is certainly : our country will not answer the violence of perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; this triumph , we will not treat the terrorists . &quot;
&quot; if criminal enforcement would have to leave the country , but the safety and strength also have the consent of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the Bundestag
&quot; he also announced another personal rein@@ forcement of the security forces , and &quot; in medium @-@ medium size order for several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism is again under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weapon quite so novel@@ ty that it is worth the purchase of weapons on the Internet . &quot;
the last much deb@@ ated welding for doctors should remain awake after de Ma@@ izi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the doctors , such as the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view about the psychological dri@@ els . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister keeps a better social support needed . &quot;
teachers would need to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ atis@@ ed people .
&quot; in the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning to be used . &quot;
&quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of Minister was clear against shareholder . &quot;
&quot; this was a ear for the char@@ ms in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , Gabriel said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke ME@@ DI@@ ENG@@ RU@@ P@@ PE ( Friday ) . &quot;

better traffic flow at the motorway R@@ ahn@@ br@@ inger
it is regularly down on the road @-@ road - here a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the legal framework should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all cars , who are in public transport on the ambient road every night at the St@@ au River , if they drive over the motorway in Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road in road building extends the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th of August ) , in the area between the hammer street and the exit of Wes@@ eler , the right @-@ lane track around 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then fly directly from the hammer street on the right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic shares the earliest , whereby the overall one will be improved in the various sections of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of the Treaty of Münster @-@ West .
the driver @-@ drive on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is annoying at the mot@@ orists mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ wards ranges from the back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes in addition . &quot;
&quot; the reason is impeccable , on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler Street . &quot;
&quot; from here , the traffic will only be log@@ ged via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second loop had to be returned in front of a well @-@ three years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had the result , that the bridge has no longer the required capacity to accommodate above all the heavy @-@ traffic lights . &quot;
&quot; how long this Eng@@ pass and the connected St@@ au will last , the local operation can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to reck@@ on : because the bridge has an official resi@@ dual duration of up to the year 2034 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal ab@@ bi@@ eg@@ esp@@ ur , the state run the traffic @-@ weak@@ ening time in the school holidays , because with disabilities to be expected . &quot;
the traffic will be run on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .

&quot; most of the young people in the class are between September 2015 and March 2016 among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and bro@@ adly enough German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ o@@ graphi@@ es , the s@@ zen@@ ische pictures and video animations it had been possible to follow the course of action on nevertheless , so the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;

rain rather than star@@ ches : hope of weather
the weather has made the star @-@ sn@@ ail Gu@@ ards in the south @-@ west Germany in the night to Friday a stand by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night is bad because of clouds and rain has been bad for this , the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chair of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;

relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , one turns out forever , at night there is a time for hours in the morning , in the morning there is no more to think about sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one of these problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleeping disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently relaxing as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleeping ?
&quot; there are several forms of sle@@ e@@ dys@@ functions , and there can be many causes of underlying causes , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ am , managing director of the German Society for Schlaf@@ es and Schlaf@@ es Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand is , however , is the in@@ som@@ er , thus an input and sle@@ ep@@ tive disorder . &quot;
&quot; just that , many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says J@@ ens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , manager at the German household medical association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is it ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , psych@@ ic or durable factors , but also medicines . &quot;
not rarely is the sle@@ ep@@ tive expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early up@@ watch is especially common in depression often , &quot; says We@@ am . &quot;
and it can be that various factors are in each other .
&quot; for example , who for example has a stre@@ amer , can lie poorly , w@@ acht every two to three hours and start wom@@ an@@ ably to p@@ onder@@ ing about all @-@ day problems and care to greet , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should one be with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; who has not been well asleep over a period of a month in at least three nights per week and the day is com@@ promised , the doctor should go . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment may look very different : one is tired , tired , uncomfortable , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or bodily ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to so@@ ften the bed@@ side , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options , among other things behaviour changes , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or drugs - classic sleeping @-@ tablets just in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ question . &quot;
&quot; Lower Sle@@ eps are not available in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of interdisciplinary Medical Center of the Char@@ ité University Medical Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; that is why you should consult with sleeping problems at first to the hous@@ eholder , &quot;
&quot; the may clear with investigations , whether the problems have a physical cause . &quot;
who should go into the sleep laboratory and what happens then ?
&quot; to study in the dormit@@ ory of medical research , for example at snor@@ ing with respir@@ ators , in disease @-@ fatigue or if one does not find the cause of a stu@@ ction trouble , explained Fi@@ etze . &quot;
you do not have to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a mid@@ day @-@ sheep , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the c@@ abling , one goes to his normal time in bed . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des in the body , one carries a rhin@@ en@@ bri@@ lle , a chest strap and a fl@@ ags on the finger . &quot;
also a camera is characterized by the ceiling .
how can sufferers have the problems get a grip on ?
&quot; there are quite a lot of pitch , where you can sleep for better sleep . &quot;
&quot; We@@ aving counts : regular bed@@ time and lifts , not too long in bed , not to sleep far away , not far away to sleep , alcohol , and at night don &apos;t look at the clock - then one starts immediately to reck@@ on , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler carried out via Facebook to dis@@ appoint the D@@ SV team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he took gold for the first time in December 2014 and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in the criticism of the ex @-@ team member states .
&quot; in a country where an Olymp@@ ics 20,000 € premium and a jungle minus 15@@ 0.000 € should not be wondering about missing medals there , wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls , on the other hand very good . &quot;
&quot; this means that we cannot compete with countries , who will not promote a lot and do not see it exactly on the subject of dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I do not say that here the controls are to be set , &quot; &quot; explained . &quot;
he wanted to start com@@ eback that he would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is how one should keep it with countries too .
&quot; if not a certain time before World Cup / OS can be controlled by independent control holes of the W@@ ada / fin@@ a , may not participate , &quot; the election of Hamburg , which meanwhile operates an ic@@ el@@ ele . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of baggage was arrested
professional Di@@ eves at Düsseldorf airport
&quot; on Thursday , the Austrian police officers had succeeded in the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the Tat@@ v@@ tigen was committed as Ban@@ de several gro@@ w@@ - and bag @-@ resistant .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30h , civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Düsseldorf a ban@@ de again which was known the police officers from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several deliber@@ ate since the middle of July of this year , and were also very professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime rate of 34 can take the thi@@ eves that were submitted to Germany , from criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four acts of actions . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had a total of more than 15,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; ancient buildings , a couple of Lin@@ den@@ b@@ äum@@ chen , a couple of Lin@@ den@@ b@@ äum@@ chen , inter@@ fere with the rest of sc@@ ams : the Rig@@ aer road in Berlin @-@ fried@@ sha@@ sha@@ in seems at first sight not so , but the police counts them among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; one goes along the road from the East to the west , one gets along the playground , a fresh@@ ly kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
at the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a gray house someone has ugly !
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl that shall be demol@@ ished , will soon be demol@@ ished : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; tr@@ en@@ ous district &quot; , &quot; like the relevant property company peac@@ em@@ sha@@ in is called for burning cars during the last few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once was it occupied , meanwhile have the residents ten@@ acity , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , the police officers had repeatedly called for a hard drive of the police against the project , the region as &quot; no @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomy . &quot;
&quot; after on June 22nd , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede were vac@@ ated by 300 police officers , according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , b@@ illing parts of the street and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
local construction workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owner the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administrative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later , police and buil@@ ders under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; at this summer morning , the road works peaceful : parents go along with children walk , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking pre@@ m Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are a elementary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main or@@ ge of many people : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the area since 1999 , and Jana * who spends three children here , especially by the police officers . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the care of rising nur@@ tures and g@@ entri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound according to an area , who wanted to do multiple police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , who made the Berlin interior and the police between the household and their neighbours , does not exist so clearly . &quot;
&quot; peaceful sha@@ h in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which is also a lower average of average than the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; some houses and the new@@ born housing projects have long been occupied for a long time : 1990 , numerous homes were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the main@@ zer was vac@@ ated under large police officers in a rule @-@ right road , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ aer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming the magn@@ ets for tourists and El@@ um@@ ber@@ ers from all over the world : with them now they share their inhabitants from the GDR @-@ times and former house . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the rental , which has increased by nearly 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ aer are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them on wor@@ ded discs or fresh rep@@ lied fac@@ ades which were dis@@ car@@ ded with dy@@ es .
&quot; no other street was mentioned so often , along with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for that not all neighbours could see this as a problem , could not necessarily be affected by the crime : crimes of bodily injury , statistics according to almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most important part of criminal off@@ ences make non @-@ alleg@@ ations made , which are to rise rather the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years , there cannot be any talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; concerning violence , it is sham@@ eful : people in the 94 are their neighbours who do not have been that . &quot;
&quot; also the famous burning cars also give it right in the Rig@@ aer , no longer . &quot;
&quot; for the studied architect , their road is not a crimin@@ ality , on the contrary , &quot; &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than wo@@ unded . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn into the Rig@@ aer road - and remained .
&quot; therefore , it was so important to get back to the inhabitants : from the police , the politics and the media , which all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of the residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away : through sear@@ ched new buildings in the former buildings that impose the old residents . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately property apartments , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well explained , &quot; says she . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction cannot be absolutely true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but what should one do , if one never li@@ stens to someone ? &quot;
&quot; there is frustration on all sides of frustration , even in the police and the residents . &quot;
&quot; for listening , the colour@@ ful bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene included in the area . &quot;
&quot; who draws , should be aware - just like someone who draws into a pub that can complain bad about noise . &quot;
&quot; all persons presented only with the names have been asked , not to be called with their proper name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact @-@ based in terms of integration and organization .
&quot; furthermore , it is a social @-@ worker in front of the place . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le the refugee camps for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ics team supports the team of managing agate in Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as a contact partner for all players : refugees , working for refugee camps , administr@@ ations , authorities and who else else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine client of the work@@ circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ vers w@@ ool w@@ ool , which has mainly a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less sp@@ ck@@ ingly , as rather on the multitude of er@@ wish tasks , targeted - meant for administration to write the place . &quot;
&quot; demanded administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social @-@ work , even a viable w@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organisation , work with people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years of time @-@ term .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le ehr@@ an and full @-@ time actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
&quot; a serious problem , it has been recognized for some time , apartments for the connection compounds which have been recognized . &quot;
in charge of the connection are the municipalities .
you have to put refugees in your own or log@@ ged residence .
the costs for the building that rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from Land@@ rat@@ eur at the Comm@@ une and J@@ ob@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lords want to offer his place . &quot;
the search has been designed for some time as a very difficult one .
de facto does not manage private apartments .
&quot; so far not so far , we are dependent on private apartments , so don &apos;t care . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments have to be made available , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing @-@ road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed lead you are practic@@ able , training courses , training courses , A @-@ euro jobs and instruc@@ tional activities for refugees and migrants who have to be found or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or help home , do charitable work - and motivated and very tidy , as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
it hopes that work for the community to become a positive effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not mean only work .
&quot; the day need a solid structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a belonging thing .
&quot; so , there are offers like sports , contacts with natives and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are r@@ ar .
&quot; so , also jump to the management and hon@@ orary posts . &quot;
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you have to explain the refugees , that it just takes and they can find the time useful , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who eventually develop the feeling , he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , which will never be integrated . &quot;
the distinct majority is motivated .
&quot; but of problems there are also , says Client honestly , &quot; people , where nothing goes . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and the client is therefore always able to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
this is all a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two after the recent occurr@@ ences are afraid of radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly , &quot; what man@@ cher can be called nai@@ ve . &quot; a Res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko would be and do not want to ex@@ clude it . &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed should be the hel@@ per .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks they are completely in call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , the main and hon@@ orary local spot must be kept out in the region and in the region . &quot;
&quot; however , they are always in the background that soon a new Sto@@ cks of refugees and migrants might come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a ceiling ?
this question is clear to answer this question .
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on @-@ site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would relax the situation . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already exc@@ eed@@ ingly successfully , the previous people are reasonable . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 persons , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they are helping them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political situation is so complex , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ ner with helic@@ opter sought
the police h@@ ub@@ op@@ ters flew about an hour long different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are aff@@ li@@ zed on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants found the two and struck the un@@ hol@@ de into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1000 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , tru@@ ths both Blu@@ e@@ je@@ ans and Black Kap@@ u@@ zen@@ pul@@ lis . &quot;
it escap@@ ed towards the city center .
&quot; to the tor@@ ney , the police set several stri@@ ps and a police h@@ ub@@ op@@ ters . &quot;
the f@@ eit@@ ing ran without success .
maybe the unknown before the apartment fell close to the apartment or during their escape .
