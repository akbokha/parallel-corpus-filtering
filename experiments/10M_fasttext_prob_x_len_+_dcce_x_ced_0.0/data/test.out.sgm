<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policies compared to: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP - they want to both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"one of them are the two US presidential, however, in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to put the economy to death, and regulated to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on the other hand, he would be quite different, maintains Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively drive regulators, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfill, he has disadvantaged opportunities and need money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"to be invested in the nuts, Trump and Clinton almost wording."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic evaluation in Announces had the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are rejected by the state of state Teachy wings of Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, in Trump, you could send another cross-party discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearly the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to rebuild carbonic power stations and again increase coal reduction in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil development should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton in contrast, Clinton wants to expand their investment programme explicitly and asks:" a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two rivals are not too far away."</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, both do not want to sign. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but just to protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"those are to be paid even better, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger pay.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump will do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">"however, the great discussion of the coming months might likely be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand is Trump, who wants to stimulate the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics are holding it before, so that the fiscal deficit would only be even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton stands at least from the rich that they pay more taxes and say their critics: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women, who alone flee, almost already in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"if they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>

<seg id="6">"each has a baby, which is at the most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid their little son in his arm.</seg>

<seg id="10">Until they noticed that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">It smiles short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is the business leader of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria, and is dealing among other things with the topic women on the flight."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are winged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Münchner North in one of the few decentralised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - even as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is an Wachmann in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here, has done on their flight experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are politically pursued because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as a hope to join Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">"for women overweigh other reasons for escape," many steal themselves secretly, because they see no other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here, all women in refugees would often be regarded as inferior and hardest."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in the North in Münchner north, it is estimated that it is estimated."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not optional."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often do not help to help, there are more accommodations only for them, asks Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven districts rule for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question whether from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, please answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is such a thing in the governments of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Swabians alone, women are not separated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher by the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Unter- and Mittelfranken can be found in some communal locations or homes only for women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is rabayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study that was released for the committee, it is said:" "it is very important that men and women are being separated."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy or are lodged together, men and women are being accommodated together, it may come to - continuous - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washing rooms should be easily accessible and accessible to women in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this protective field, it is possible to see the ingestion that gives it to the house in Munich."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Allianz of aliens"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and proclaimed a official end of the eight months long lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes its Turkish counterplayers in the seated hall of the St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I can't forget the expression that Ankara wants to win this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the hand, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile procked, and he has little heat off, even for its backward relationships."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, he repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report full of five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count it.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even further improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day a newspaper that Erdogan had heard so that Erdogan would have heard, as if there was never anything worse."</seg>
<seg id="11">Me seemed like his enthusiasm to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin exradiant, sustainable cooling showed that the state of Russia had nothing forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory mating: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was awake.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Putin shared and accused Ankara, Russia fell into his back."</seg>
<seg id="16">Leaving was even bigger because it was committed by a good friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Vetrust can rebuild again is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"months long, the state controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed to be the door for everything to blame."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the most serious officers, the accusations were benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which could be controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg was the official message, that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erdogan that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a ceasefire must be clearly stated on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is needed primarily all friends who can get it after his last month at a failed state almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also shaken it too.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have made Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is gone by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated, if the flights are recorded."</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a delay in the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week prognosed the state, cheap fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agrarian imported."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulate it:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry in the West since it's reaction to the tried to take power over the weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to do this, the continued Groll come across the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the blackout, out of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian heads in Ankara won a bonus that he called for the attempted state of support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-tolerated for Moscow, a self-understanding that even has a deep-sitting fear of rain."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace at the sea allowed it Russia and Turkey, one which once seemed to present me an analytic" "alliance of aliens" ": two countries who encounter themselves from the West and are now being treated badly and now."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are differences between the two still great differences."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the largest difference in Syria, where Moscow has recently been the role as a peacemakers", "but where Russia and Turkey are opposing views."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it might be revealing that after almost three hours of initial discussions, both of the presidents spoke at the press conference that they could not even shed the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the president of Turkey rent it clear to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete discoaster, as NATO member, Turkey, the Russian Kampfjet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State were at least again talking to one another."</seg>

<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who is supposed to build the favorable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD-president Christoph Bratmann says:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas in future, 20 percent of all apartments must be exhibiting as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be developed in stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the large dispute point in the city hall is, however Bratmann:" how do you go to investors who want to build on private spaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "we want investors on such a surface at least 10 percent, but as best as 20 percent of the apartments are building as a social housing."</seg>

<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the program is not yet entirely: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you like the loss of further about 1,300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will be run in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments alone by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, as the planning-policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought from the city now."</seg>

<seg id="27">Because in the west city run the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price of cheap apartments there.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>

<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the varied rebuilding of sound is not based on a boom in millennials that would like to greet the novelty of physical objects, but also to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all predictive after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hormone by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older flat-runners rather keep her feelings rather for himself (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a modest road in Soho, before I keep steal, my hands hold and something determined to say like:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look at it."</seg>

<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: he is now able to purchase plates that he could not afford, when they had appeared and again sold items that he sold, when he was young and plague."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things when I was probably something to young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy the boards, rather introverted and likes to spend time, and add:" I don't smoke and I drink not much. "</seg>

<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medienhpe people who have heard about the comeback, and let's see their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually have been kidnapped around 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records now," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to trailers of the record revised of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to recognize that record shop has a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers attended the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to pull out to the stability of trusted mukets, of objects, the happy itorderships. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material owner than a kind of consolation," "says WEZ."</seg>

<seg id="57">"no one sees her - maybe because they are only pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them."</seg>
<seg id="58">"it is pure" record "." "</seg>

<seg id="2">"a day after they had shot three gates during a 6-1 winner over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American Feldhockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday to India that the Americans have won 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five goals in two games should actually represent a thoughtful performance, but Bam (27) said it could not remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not among the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">But that knows them: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons on the first place that remain unbeaten to Japan after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>

<seg id="9">The first platter will take a little longer out of the way that the other group lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may start on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania on, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she was the most recent in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympiad in 2008 as she could not qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham was named Craig Parnham, an Englishman, Trainer of the National Team, and thus began to turn things to better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work of work in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the rest of the rods can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Thursday, Bam opened the gate in the first half of the game with a setback from the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was gone to the game without a victory in the tournament into the game, but the team showed herself surprisingly strong, and held the play of 1-0 to the third quarter until the game took into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it accomplished a sprint with the flat ball over the left flanges, then moved to the center and lupens the ball into the gate to get a 2-0 guide."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the doorkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a rapid easing between competition and pursuit."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as if the olympic Fackel itself would be a burning stab that will protect from the bracelets to swimmer for the Triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can not switch the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the queue in the coffee shop, without about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time in the Olympic Games, and a women's warm with dimples, could certainly have been sent among these known names which were sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he would be a swimmer, Turner or even Fgenuine."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame is not illuminated every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized: airbrush, Archery, Badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may reign it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I might make humble arguments for my particular love, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has already been a olympic event since 2000, it had noticed since 2000 it was the last 16 years so much noticed that many that I asked, did not know that it is at all an Olympiasportart."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the US Athleten sent to competition, there has never won a medal in the trampoline and until 2012 had made a athletes who made it to final dogs."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to see the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rocks MacLennan from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline has a certain outside charme, partly because it sounds an enlightened ear for an unenlightened ear for a clowning school as those for the Olympic Games sounds."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a refreshed enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoral potential - the carditoonous trembling of his never to end-up - but also the Grazie of athletic and doves, the two sports, which combines it essentially."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"jumping winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (rotating, hens and otos) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are evaluated according to the official Olympiaprogram to execution, difficulty and 'flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women are compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists must go further in their quest for gold, faster, to the top and drunk, sometimes to the destination, sometimes round and back to the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only chase the Ziellinie or the output wall, but in the television transfer also another height target: the world or the Olympiarekords."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the purposeful desire is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a viewers to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I want to look at the chance of these games as something fatigued.</seg>
<seg id="30">"of this, the trampoline offers an atropause."</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolinspringers is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A upward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"or she prallt, seemingly heavier like a astronaut, goes to top, then back down, then effortlessly back upwards."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves into the distance, just the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's such Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification round and final cleaning of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will beam the final round as part of a afternoon blocks to both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to overlooked overlooked."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the consciousness of consciousness can only be achieved by the attacking and the lenses of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently, Mr. Dooley awaits his after air rinks, new fan."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a foe of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who are calling for political changes in Ethiopia as opposed to violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protested during the clashes with the police have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia precisely here to sum up?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid state of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government the country and grew up in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people on the streets and required fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses raised that policemen were shot in zig unarmed demonstrators and rolls.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the circulation of well-being videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or early of this year, show how security of young people were hit with sticks while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The leader of the UN Agency for Human Rights is now calling for a further investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold up this country and in future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands into a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new pendent in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia has anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organizations have introduced the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, and dissiders were effective for silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and these no other options have except to protest, it breaks off," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central America. "</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protest.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground-use until the wording in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this delicate, controversial line called in June hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists as the Oromo-liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been more or less imposed in recent years, which could benefit more or less."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitter after years of getting rid of Hinköchelns under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media, as cheap smartphones have been more frequent and improved the Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the Government sets access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially for protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies to hide where they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave them that they gathered so at prototypes.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnies in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since the annons of the Amharas, the Amharas, which are mainly due to Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are living and in lowland-areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are able to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray that constitute about 6 percent of the population, which are dominant in the military services, in trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former vine leader, was up to his death on a failed disease in 2012 17 years ago Ethiopian Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think of corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analyst say that he was particularly versed in it to use early signs of dissatisfaction and special officers to process opponents and make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analytic. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopians of new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively inscrutable reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray control services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time you lived such a turmoil and lived in 2005, after thousands of elections protesters, according to the data of analyzes, was apparently stolen by the government and were subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raid, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in recent months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts, Ethiopians are leaders for their visionaries infrastructure, such as the new penitator, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month of attacked protest in gondar, a amharische town, of Tigray guided shops and the hatred opposite the Tigray becomes more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests in the USA and other Western allies can put into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronym on the neighboured Somalia, even if they recently pointed out that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"during the West, he clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his exile in a already volatiful area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "" is a very thin. "</seg>

<seg id="3">Grönland haie usually come only in winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the Starship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with good a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-haie got only 150 years of offspring.</seg>

<seg id="9">But this of long-loneliness of life seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "at any rate of a Greenland, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Schünlein by the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span that means for spans a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolution of evolution has been long since Greenland become rocky."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacking the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland haie are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea before the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they dive on the surface mostly only in winter."</seg>

<seg id="18">"loot make this sharks yet, in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remnants of a robe, another had the pine nopses of a young iron."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they chase them sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek cadaver that from higher water layers down to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, analyzes them with the carbon-14 method the lens of the sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyelid occurs already before the birth of the sharks, that the proteins contained in it will be no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, their birth should be lying after the early 1960s, when the nuclear weapons attempt greater amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in which with 220 centimetres in length of third animal, the Linsensei remains a low level of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, so it might have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland-haie had a normal carbon-14 quantities, which arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 centimeters long Greenland a age of 335 years, while the record-shark might even be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-females first got off last night, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length could arrange an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals have been determined with 392 centimeters on the cusp of the sexually mature and his age of 156 years was determined, Grönland with the multiplication was obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this might be the most likely for vertebrates of the world.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is not accidental.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Grönland wal, in whose speck on Nacken a 120 years old Harder tip, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism is still running the animals of the animals living there."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to warm up in the cold water, the animals are often particularly big."</seg>
<seg id="38">"for the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal gets heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is so dangerous and should focus on it as soon as possible as possible as possible," "explains the evolution of evolution."</seg>

<seg id="25">"they are explaining their sacrificing by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set freely accessible support sites or decode for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and they will redeem individuals after payments of a few hundred billion, companies need to negotiate hard and pay five stellige totals to return their data."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky winnings from the Ransomware Erpressors, the hacker is always professional and sharing the work, explains security experte Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus provider Sophos," a single person can write a ransomware approximately within one week.

<seg id="7">"Regine client of the workcircle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eivers wool wool, which has mainly a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so, some - less spckingly, as rather on the multitude of erwish tasks, targeted - meant for administration to write the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"demanded administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social-work, even a viable wool."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organisation, work with people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent spot on three years of time-term.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle ehran and full-time actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a serious problem, it has been recognized for some time, apartments for the connection compounds which have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">In charge of the connection are the municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to put refugees in your own or logged residence.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the building that rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from Landrateur at the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlords want to offer his place."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as a very difficult one.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto does not manage private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far not so far, we are dependent on private apartments, so don't care."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments have to be made available, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing-road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed lead you are practicable, training courses, training courses, A-euro jobs and instructional activities for refugees and migrants who have to be found or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building or help home, do charitable work - and motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that work for the community to become a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a belonging thing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, there are offers like sports, contacts with natives and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, also jump to the management and honorary posts."</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you have to explain the refugees, that it just takes and they can find the time useful, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who eventually develop the feeling, he could not help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, which will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but of problems there are also, says Client honestly," people, where nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and the client is therefore always able to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">This is all a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two after the recent occurrences are afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer very clearly, "what mancher can be called naive." a Restrisiko would be and do not want to exclude it. "</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized should be the helper.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks they are completely in call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, the main and honorary local spot must be kept out in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">"however, they are always in the background that soon a new Stocks of refugees and migrants might come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them helpers on-site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived there where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, this would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already exceedingly successfully, the previous people are reasonable."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 persons, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they are helping them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political situation is so complex, there are no simple answers."</seg>
