Obama welcomes Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly .
the two intended to oppose the implementation of the international agreement and oppose Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; for the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the ongoing sett@@ able settlement of Israel and thro@@ ws up a continued action in the peace process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; through the Obama &apos;s promoted climate , the Iranian nuclear programme has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship of the two . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu has held a controversial government at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans prior to the US Congress , which had been valued as an af@@ front against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not dismis@@ sed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with a reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
in a cler@@ ical blo@@ ws Professor to have his girlfriend went shot
in a letter Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on &apos;s represented with a somewhat timi@@ d voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that his house would have to come to his home .
&quot; Lamb is important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; little dog &quot; &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of dead woman might be found on mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; the officers of the house found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written notice : &quot; I was so sorry , I loved it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved . &quot; this was the question of the authorities in the letter , and he was represented by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that represented in two online courses for the Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Mississippi , under@@ directed 300 miles on the school premises , where he was shot to the police a popular history Professor , E@@ than Schmidt , shot to his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Poly@@ im@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18@@ pm .
he said that he &apos;s rejected the mysterious emergency day sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lam@@ b caught the life as the police inv@@ it@@ ated him .
&quot; a day after the shooting at the University , the students and teachers to hide behind closed doors to hide behind closed doors , try to get an idea of what &apos;s motiv@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the inquiries to both ends of the state , as well as what the students and employees who knew him , helped him out a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers to draw . &quot;
students said that they were engaged in their teaching .
&quot; the police in the Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , &quot; he did not have any history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned represented in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; , &quot; he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both sub@@ ordin@@ ated in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teacher has 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , who &apos;s praised he also seemed a bit worried and ed@@ gy , as if something with him was wrong . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lam@@ b told him he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
he previously had the Delta State University to have asked for health reasons for health reasons and said he could have some health problem .
in this year he only set up two online courses .
&quot; latest changes in the employment policy of the university , that the Promotion , had worked so hard for the lam@@ b , would represent no guarantee for an automatic road to an employment as an assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; university president William La@@ For@@ ge said , he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was a little bit of Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s conception . &quot;
these are questions we can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus the police were later trace of lam@@ bs when he returns to Mississippi from Ark@@ ansas .
&quot; before it could be arrested , compl@@ ained on@@ ward with an .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people that he lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; he began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and studied geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he took his doctor@@ ate in the spring in educ@@ ator .
&quot; one of the long @-@ term girl@@ friends of Lam@@ bs drew him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met through mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her guitar playing . &quot;
he was then the women &apos;s hot .
&quot; all the girls are mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the call he said , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no evidence of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick building which was adjacent to a ba@@ it in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she was sho@@ ved off 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
they and their mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he &apos;s never met , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played in blues . &quot;
he &apos;s represented Pr@@ enti@@ ss but he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail joined two years ago both on a summer market .
later they played together one or another .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse responsible for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sh@@ af@@ fer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak lighted bar close to the Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s represented Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ous Night in the night 5th of September , ended in front of a pregnant audience . &quot;
there were no signs of anything that something did not coinci@@ de .
&quot; just a lucky pair , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the au@@ zer and jo@@ king with each other .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , senior the first @-@ term seminar and specialized in American natives and colonial history , says Don All@@ an Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ansas and was President of his Br@@ otherhood and the students Committee .

Michael J. Fox over@@ came over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre of the Roy@@ als , and I noticed that the seat is next to me empty , and it will gradually realise that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me that I can simul@@ ated a simul@@ ated guns and an ar@@ ching length of it , with the Princess of Wales in a date . &quot;

UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia strengthened military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss again calls for all parties , including the Shar@@ ed UN Security Council to unite and integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the Ministers of Ministers of five permanent member nations of the Council - U.S. , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the minist@@ erial meeting of General Assembly for this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he is de@@ plor@@ able that the spl@@ its in the Council and the Syrian people and the Po@@ wers &apos; situation make this situation in@@ sol@@ uble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; B@@ an asked the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they proved to be demonstrated by Iran in the achievement of a nuclear de@@ part of Iran . &quot;
8 re@@ tention values indicated that Donald Tru@@ mp is seriously to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to drag Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks of Poll@@ s down , it has not yet worked . &quot;
ten of the last eleven national surveys run Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ dig@@ it field and some begin to seriously ask what it means for nom@@ ination of nom@@ ination of real estate .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody argu@@ ed that Tru@@ mp are likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts say that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys came to the Asc@@ ent Herman C@@ ain , none of whom won only one state in the nom@@ inations process . &quot;
there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; however , external groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s stamina and start to drop its dollars to pl@@ unge it . &quot;
&quot; here are some current speci@@ ality values , which suggest that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase : &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s Beli@@ eb@@ ell values have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy middle of June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten republi@@ cans looked positively . &quot;
up to mid July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative attitude .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa did last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as a Candi@@ date .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Republi@@ cans , they would be either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; happy &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm like Tru@@ mp ( 43 per cent , they would be &quot; &quot; excited &quot; &quot; about 40 percent , who say the same thing over Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
what is next in my enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio at just 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters do , that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied or &quot; angry , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Republi@@ cans sees Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and bel@@ lied statements , 52 percent of the former Irish voters have critic@@ ised the correct temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first pre @-@ elect@@ oral state of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think that it has the personality for a com@@ mander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively carry out office and almost six out of 10 in@@ depen@@ dents said that his temper@@ ament does not p@@ ale in the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they set up their money , the Republi@@ can voters carries Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if you are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination wins , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C in the past week four out of ten , that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
that is a change since the time when four out of ten end of July began their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete revelations : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est cryst@@ all@@ isation in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten republi@@ cans reported that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final candidates Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ vote Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign could be plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Republi@@ can refer to another Candi@@ date , H@@ mp also proposes almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that the spl@@ itting field will likely contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is more than a dozen other candidates counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September reveals that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp Com@@ bin@@ es the majority . &quot;
&quot; he has 2 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ ze and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ an @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only cont@@ est@@ ant that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on race .
&quot; a scar@@ ce majority of Donald &apos;s Tru@@ mp fans says , that they have formed their minds . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters will support the Tru@@ mp , say that they have confirmed their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say to change the mind . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said that they leave the door open , in order to switch to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; however , Tru@@ mp@@ s strongest competition in the moment the other out@@ si@@ der , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters , which say they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 republi@@ cans say , that they are in combination with Tru@@ mp on the matter of immigration . &quot;
&quot; since then , Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign was called for two months of immigrants from Mexico &quot; Rap@@ ist &quot; , &quot; was the immigration and fishing hub in the public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic press @-@ pressure of Tru@@ mp are far away from the Republi@@ can party and imp@@ aired the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey , from Monday six out of 10 republi@@ cans they agree with Tru@@ mp on questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration lies in the li@@ mel@@ ight , the Donald Tru@@ mp will appear to do too . &quot;
the frustration of the government climb over new high@@ s .
&quot; at Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now accounts about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , notably through their out@@ si@@ der status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 republi@@ cans say in the new Mont@@ ing survey of ABC @-@ Mail , they rather want a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry in Washington .
a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in Io@@ wa three weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by 54 per cent &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive living accommodations in Germany &quot;

&quot; upon Sy@@ lt is the offer of objects naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special rounds is one square meter the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for one student office in Munich are not really little . &quot;
in contrast to Germany top @-@ residential places such a price is like Pe@@ anu@@ ts .

&quot; there are several ten thousand Euros nix - per square meter , well @-@ sto@@ cked . &quot;

a lucky hit by Thomas Müller p@@ lied the FC Bayern the Way to a earned 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ che@@ us - then it ran .
a sovereign N@@ ude of the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have brought a dream start to FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pir@@ re@@ aus .

they showed a concentrated and dedicated perception without to shine .
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had gained his recent six do games in the royal class , including against rep@@ utable cl@@ ubs as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els were defeated with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went to bold , but from their offensive efforts but often to un@@ com@@ mon@@ y to works . &quot;
the attacks often went on by le@@ aking t@@ ying on left @-@ out Douglas Costa in a way that crossed the previous Braunschweig Om@@ ar Eli@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i rarely .
&quot; Müller took more luck from the right , when his side st@@ ank from the right semi @-@ field in the upper left corner of the Tor@@ eck . &quot;
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .

&quot; like that , when he had a shot of ide@@ e about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; in front of him , Guardi@@ ola left a quad@@ ru@@ gs with David Al@@ aba in the centre near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Götz@@ e , according to mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ res , sitting at first outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup Her@@ o gave a green light only after the desc@@ endant , &quot; said Sport@@ vor@@ s Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that &apos;s quite mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
also at the first change he decided against him when he brought King@@ sl@@ ey Com@@ an for the Asc@@ ended Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .

&quot; who consuming it , has a higher risk , to lose teeth &quot;
&quot; who consuming , shr@@ ink thus not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that sets a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : r@@ zi@@ tion lo@@ wers the risk fast .
smokers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this goes out of the long @-@ term study of an international research teams , including several employees of the German Institute of Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers @-@ holes , there were the risk to lose their teeth in pre@@ matur@@ ely , in order to pre@@ matur@@ ely - up to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the researchers had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
&quot; root causes for break@@ down are c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ um , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these par@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors . &quot;
the relation between smoking and dental loss is therefore back to common g@@ um inflammation in smokers .
&quot; not clear , to what extent do smoking also increases the risk for tooth decay . &quot;
&quot; people who heard out of smoking could reduce their risk within a short amount of time , then write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it would last over ten years until the threat to the level of non @-@ smokers , first @-@ author Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; people can convince people of this , non@@ smoking , stated study masters of a Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; qu@@ itting the life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and results after our findings also at a good dental health to the high age .
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population affected by 65 to 74 years of dental treatment , shared by DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early dental loss .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over the TTIP
for the release of the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the EU Commission has proposed a substantial reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration mechanisms for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be dis@@ solved by a transparent system , which in its way t@@ aps clearly more traditional cuisine . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ian at the question@@ able of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the question@@ able of the Prime Minister with excitement expected
Mr Bur@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to be his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to noon for the first of his six pre @-@ com@@ missions set shortly after noon and his performance from the media is likely to be examined and the Labour MEPs from the vicinity .
he called &quot; less theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also stated that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave them to their colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , as she is coming to his appointment as a member of the cabinet and his speech at TU@@ C @-@ Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the singing of the national anth@@ ems at a commemor@@ ative ceremony on the 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory MPs , faces the main focus of a title @-@ stories about the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decided not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne has attracted attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , he was &quot; &quot; dis@@ respectful of silence &quot; &quot; and he did the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ et , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he got to sing the Labour leaders to sing the national anth@@ ems , &quot; regardless &quot; of his faith that the monarchy was to be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns for excellence , and they are called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary Party originally supported him as leaders . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences belong to the Labour Party &quot; , &quot; said Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns comments on the position of the European Union and the limit for women . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes occurred to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow and pensions and pensions ministers said that the party &quot; said to be &quot; very clear &quot; that they can only down to £ 23,@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron and since he has been T@@ ory boss in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the parliament .
&quot; the Labour president , which promised a different political approach , says he &quot; &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 articles . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister has become a front@@ ational , and that he has conducted both &quot; &quot; p@@ ulation &quot; &quot; and the dispute with Resi@@ stance and instead p@@ aving to serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Merkel , the shadows of economics , is represented if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally grab the word and that he found John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ person of the House of Commons , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; who often linked to the question of Prime Minister . but a few years later he discovered that he has failed . &quot;
&quot; since it has been sent on TV in 1990 , the question has been argu@@ ed with the prime minister of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and its position under his parliamentary committees , although critics were argu@@ ed , they become a caric@@ ature and indication far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

the idea brought him a poster in a P@@ EG@@ I@@ DA demonstration with the wor@@ ding of &quot; potatoes instead of don@@ er . &quot; he had seen it by chance on television .
&quot; since then , in its shop he turns into a bar@@ be@@ que grill , equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has now reached the Leb@@ anese in the meantime in the patent office in Munich .
they have recently been protected by the authority as a used pattern .
&quot; like a lot of meat and how much potatoes the sp@@ ie@@ ch contains , Al@@ h@@ ay do not want to bet@@ ray . &quot;

met@@ an@@ .de laun@@ ches ground up campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ diar@@ rhe@@ a
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the Ig@@ A branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ R@@ ise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale Met@@ cash has launched an Under@@ standing campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million of the Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di , the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia prepared early next year , strengthening Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets to expand its relations with local food suppliers and marketing the brand Ig@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing through the Social Media on , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like iron manufacturers S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ borough , who sold in Ig@@ A @-@ shops samples and shop@@ ke@@ e@@ pers who sell to sell tickets for the South Australian Football Reg@@ in@@ ers to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will release further details of its defence strategy on 29 September , if the wholesale distributor for foods , alcohol and devices goes through its annual investors . &quot;
&quot; it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia can make nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ shop@@ pers and higher profits as a met@@ a @-@ Ig@@ A @-@ Network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; in South Australia and Western Australia , not@@ ables in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 per cent in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analy@@ zes like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets approximately five percent of the food market in these two states will be pushed away and all existing players , but mainly independent ret@@ ailer and retailers will take away . &quot;
&quot; in this week , the analy@@ st of the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ailer 360 million sales per year and Met@@ cash 250 millions $ to the end of 2016 could be lost . &quot;
that progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened to 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and generates sales of 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and groc@@ eries and in the quantities of Met@@ cas@@ hs hot fixed cost @-@ based , Met@@ cash could cost some 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ Single is the most faithful . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley takes off that Met@@ cas@@ hs sales up to 3.8 percent in 2016 to drop 4.8 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and will reduce the market share of 14 per cent by 2020 to 10,@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week told the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably van@@ ish within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
cash cash rejected it to publicly respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
yet it is assumed that a manager of Met@@ cash received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ As market share has been in@@ duced since 2010 by 18 percent to 14 per cent , and revenues from Met@@ cas@@ hs food and food wholesale , which is supplied approximately 1.@@ 200 Ig@@ A ret@@ ailer , has been around 43 percent since 2012 , refl@@ ecting its operating dormit@@ ories with simultaneous print on turnover and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the wholesale distributor W@@ hon@@ ours however , and is investing more than 150 million $ , sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ vo@@ ths to improve their stores by getting faster growing fresh foods and deliver a better choice of private label food products . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ cade &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice , says that the pricing and loading @-@ refurb@@ ishment programs are to be submitted and hop@@ ed that the wholesale distributor in 2017 returns to a profit growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis club Steve Heal@@ y
T@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise as criticism for its behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; &quot; in the recent storm with his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves to praise the President of the Australian tennis club Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for its own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; to get caught by the in@@ famous exchanges of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka with the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery Quali@@ fication game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was supposed to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison was called : &quot; Wa@@ an@@ inka has had to beat C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a c@@ amp@@ er promised a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Co@@ kin@@ akis was defended by Heal@@ y Co@@ zy . &quot;
&quot; the teen is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in a single course behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals . &quot;
&quot; one thing I conc@@ eive myself , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little bit into the dispute , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et that he lost because of a cr@@ ut@@ ch in the US Open , but he is not the first player to have a r@@ ack@@ et from frustration with yourself and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has changed extremely well in the US Open @-@ Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he earned a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I believe he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old who works very hard , and he adap@@ ts to the team , and so on , he has never respected a problem with the other players , he is good in shape , he is well done in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision to take K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os on the important preced@@ ents , which on Friday begins , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; than the right for all , but he saves the man of Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term solid feature to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not on all the contro@@ l@@ apping around &#91; C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick was done very quickly , where people worked out as a Feder@@ er and Murray . he goes out in the eyes of the public , and he deserves to support him , we try to consider him the consequences of his actions . I think it &apos;s best for the team and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency meeting ends the border of refugees
&quot; Hungary explains the not@@ stance and broke the southern border with Serbia on the Tuesday , and held every firm who tried to go illegal in the country . everything with the aim of stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed at the border , when hundreds of migrants were gathered in a kidney @-@ land and ser@@ b@@ ish officials with rebellion . &quot;
&quot; the people who were flying before violence , push for an unknown period of w@@ ro@@ am on the road between the two points of the countries , and built tents and settled down there . &quot;
but fru@@ ition .
&quot; as a police helic@@ opter on them ho@@ vering , sc@@ andi@@ zed the migrants &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and sm@@ aking Bel@@ ar@@ ches against the Hungarian polic@@ emen . &quot;
some transferred from protest to food and water back .
&quot; serving Minister of Foreign Affairs , it is &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) will be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damages .
&quot; in the coming days talks to Brussels and other countries have to be held , &quot; I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il in the hung@@ arian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ Block with a firm meeting in Brussels could not agree upon a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who sought under over@@ shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they aff@@ lic@@ ted their hopes that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would eventually reported that the EU states would pick up further 120@@ .000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an extraordinary summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , made its hopes not to be an aw@@ ful action from Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency meeting in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to get out of the crisis , so they could block roads and asylum . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said , that his country also highlighted the construction of a bar@@ bed wir@@ ls along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence at the Ser@@ b border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ailers in the race , the bar@@ bed @-@ wire bond between Hungary and Serbia were created . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has grown for many war ties from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and the input point into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has insi@@ sted that most in@@ coming economic migrants are , who are on the search for a better life , and not war assem@@ bling that are entitled to protection - a view which is strongly in contradiction with other EU countries , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws which entered into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the corrupt of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall of us , to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , for a crime . these laws also impose a higher proportion of commission@@ ers for jud@@ g@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; given the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government states the state of state , said government spokes@@ person Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ o@@ inter@@ tern in the southern town of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree with the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ por@@ ters of Associ@@ ated Press , who armed the armed forces with vehicles and dogs are already seen for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ ors for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people trying to cross the border to cross the border ; 15 others have already had gotten deeper into the country . &quot;
they come across as they damaged the fence ; they are now arrested in police and will be accused of crimes of crimes in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are ready to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials also shut down two of the seven bor@@ derland with Serbia , after having reached a wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire , in order to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos embr@@ aced the main crossing of Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and put a crowd @-@ amount to move on there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded , but thousands were staying outside . &quot;
&quot; another group of migrants block the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse food and water until they go to Hungary . &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ on &apos;s lead in front of Bern@@ ie S@@ anders in the national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to remain a two @-@ dig@@ it jump in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Bern@@ ie S@@ anders wins this towards the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the previous elections ( 58 % previously ) , while S@@ anders is second in second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed whether he is elected President of the President , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most of the democratic voters want it too early to say that their opinion thinks that candidates will support them . &quot;
but Cl@@ int@@ ons supporters are more scattered in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton have lost a series of demo@@ graphic groups during the course of a number of gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have less@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ int@@ ons an advantage in democratic voters among the age of 50 years has exp@@ ired , and they are , and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
but Clinton has a big head start with the older voters .
&quot; last month , Clinton had stood before S@@ anders with two @-@ dig@@ it lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point head start with this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections , they would like to support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;
&quot; a quarter would support them with some bearing and another 15 percent would only support them , because it is the nomin@@ ee . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
&quot; perhaps not surprising that Cl@@ int@@ ons are , and most of all about her . &quot;
&quot; the views are stronger with those who , at present Clinton does not support - only about a quarter would they be thrilled . &quot;
&quot; during 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections they can say Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters do this above their leaders in Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 % ) . &quot;
&quot; if Cl@@ int@@ ons are asked in an open question why they want it is the most common response that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time is that a woman is a president ( 13 percent ) and that they will be the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; by Cl@@ int@@ ons supporters , their association with Bill Clinton is also mentioned . &quot;
consent to dealing with problems and voters shall be c@@ ited .
&quot; as the Vice President grants a potential for the Office of the Office of the Office , 57 per cent of the democratic voters will see him in the race - although a third thinks that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked by the elections , who would be a second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; by Cl@@ int@@ ons followers , say more than half that bid@@ ding would be far ahead of His second choice . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is decided not to nom@@ inations for the nom@@ ination of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ on &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bid@@ ding in betting on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate , as a candidate to win elections ; however , this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; by far , Bi@@ den is by far a second factor in this measurement , but the percentage of people that see him as the &apos; chosen &apos; , has increased . &quot;
&quot; however , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , democratic voters ask questions about voters . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate to consider this voters of the presidential elections as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential applicants get good results in some important features for voters of the party elections .
&quot; maj@@ orities , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong executive qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cuts in the three candidates most from honesty , while cl@@ int@@ ons is the leader . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 per cent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters see the elections in general also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ on@@ ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion from us . &quot;
&quot; having questions about Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons are continuing to be present with their personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office , most of the Democratic voters of the previous elections are satisfied with their reference to the matter and say it has not influenced their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; half of the Americans now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the issue of light came , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans say that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent had said that their opinion of her was still deteri@@ or@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 which say their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is seen by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 per cent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight per cent less than last month , and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not keep it for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elect@@ or@@ ate land@@ es@@ far also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp receive good notes at leadership .
&quot; of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best be best in honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees something rather than honest , but like Car@@ son many do not have any idea of it . &quot;
&quot; the error rate of the sample volume of 3@@ 51 , constitu@@ ents of the presidential elections is 6 percentage points . &quot;
Ben Car@@ son shifts at land@@ es@@ further pol@@ l near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is located at the newest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; due to the two candidates , half of the support of the voters goes out in the new survey , and others are losing a dramatic impact . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted against Fox News debate last month by 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son flo@@ wed at the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son met with demo@@ graphic groups and met Tru@@ mp at Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio , John Ka@@ met , who has fallen in deepest with Wis@@ con@@ v Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deepest of 10 % support in the last month at now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former governor of J@@ eb Bush , the former governor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place . &quot;
the error items during the sampling of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son runs in the surveys - he landed at 19 % support at the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp considerably before Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at one of the last week Asc@@ ent Car@@ son found , Tru@@ mp found some side@@ places to the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son har@@ med faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on last Saturday during a show event in Io@@ wa . &quot;
pleasant bathing : the eastern part of the Mediterranean is at present up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; also when peak levels are measured only in the distance , a trip from the Mediterranean can already be found in the Mediterranean to offer still warm water . &quot;
a dip in the north or Baltic Sea is likely to be a maximum of a maximum of 17 degrees .
some more people go into the sea : maximum 18 degrees the water in the north and Baltic sea during this week shares the German weather service ( DW@@ D ) with each other .
&quot; bathing : in contrast , the Mediterranean Sea continues to offer : in the east it comes even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is located at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Br@@ otherhood has been deb@@ ited with the death of a bar@@ uch college .
&quot; almost two years after a student during a fl@@ aw@@ ful ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , will mo@@ urn for five people . &quot;
members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood of Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ritual in September 2013 was brutal and ench@@ anted his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death to the police . &quot;
&quot; officials spoke that he had been deb@@ ited with their eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeated , while he tried to go over a frozen field at a destination . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g finally qu@@ ailed over head@@ aches ; then he fell unconscious .
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood does not get the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g impot@@ ently was disp@@ uted and waiting for an hour before they brought it into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to conf@@ use D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to contact her symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Br@@ otherhood to contact Rat , said M@@ acc@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point , members of U@@ ten@@ os began to hide and put the good of the Br@@ otherhood fundamentally on the von Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poly@@ im@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
he could not revi@@ ved again and he died in the next morning at his injuries .
&quot; after an automatic generation , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt strength injuries at the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the chic@@ ks of the Br@@ otherhood . at least one student dies in the sli@@ ders , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , represents in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and that step of public authorities is very important . &quot;
&quot; a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indic@@ t@@ ment for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ thirty members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged by sheer attack and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to make the involved persons responsible , but if there is an organization who , officially , officially , officially , we will also apply this to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College is banned by the Br@@ otherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation to the town group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
&quot; a zinc @-@ empha@@ sizes entered , and the house will enter into the w@@ ob@@ ble , return for bonds and the economy gets gli@@ ding into a recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long that will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little instructions on how to do it . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggression of the Federal Reserve of raising the interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US central bank have empha@@ sized that investors should not focus on it when it begins to increase the interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
&quot; at the end , market participants could determine that the entire excitement because of a Zin@@ ser@@ ture was perhaps exagger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the first raise of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ itably to be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of the &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , boss at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , we do not expect a gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still to the lowest level , to the sei@@ sm@@ ic shock , which many seem to be afraid to . &quot;
&quot; this , however , does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
&quot; here , one of the historical trends of fact @-@ looking eye on how some areas of the economy could react : &quot;
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the inc@@ ess@@ ation of Zin@@ ser@@ ca@@ vities may make things for a@@ while vol@@ ati@@ le . &quot;
&quot; once the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to increase wealth of wealth 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank Analy@@ sts in a newer study about what happened following Zin@@ c ca@@ vities in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market is usually published during the past 35 years - approximately 14 per cent - on the path to Zin@@ ser@@ ture , fairly flat in the 250 days later ( average profits of 2.9 percent ) , then back to normal sales after 500 days , with an average yield in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , Bob D@@ oll , Chief Investment Strategic on Nu@@ ron &apos;s Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stocks will rise to the increasing cycle in the increasing cycle and the return of return begins to dimin@@ ish .
&quot; rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic activity , but Zin@@ ser@@ ths boost them often . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some terms that could not exist before and accelerate the one recession . &quot;
&quot; extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is in close proximity of its lowest point , in a sin@@ us@@ efulness of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , in 118 Zin@@ co ca@@ vities had only been rated by nominal GDP by only 4,5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3,@@ 6 percent , only a few that will last and expect the third quarter to arrive after the Atlanta F@@ ed just 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; zinc ca@@ vities with such frag@@ mented economic backdrop could be risky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time it is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
market participants have made a change in the interests of F@@ ed throughout the year and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday .
&quot; while many str@@ aps and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could be an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures trading is just a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the boo@@ sting cycles from 1950 to the present day in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , took place on pre @-@ re@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ öh@@ en very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; but in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which has maintained the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far it was 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the firm income was also vol@@ ati@@ le since the market takes advantage of zinc @-@ empha@@ sizes , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect at bonds is faster than in stock , if that change its strategic course . &quot;
&quot; at bonds , the rate appear to change the direction once the first increase in the cycle is carried out . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the c@@ rests , the c@@ eas@@ ef@@ acts fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ at@@ ests of Charles Schw@@ ab believing that the increase in interest rates will result in the interest rates , and result in a gap between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a break@@ down of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ level bonds often bring better revenue , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ tist at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , Jones means that the markets have already been adapted to the F@@ ed strategy . &quot;
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of in@@ flows , there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the earning ur@@ ve is flat , bl@@ ackl@@ ed and the vol@@ ati@@ lity have increased - all characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed tight@@ ened its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies that benefit the larger part of their business operations in the U.S. , will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts are worse , as the ending of dollars will make their products on the global market more expensive and just as the financing of their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares should tend to respond positively , three months after an initial cre@@ ening effect , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ analy@@ st in a report to the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with low balance sheet after each of the zinc @-@ ca@@ vities in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points . &quot;
&quot; companies with high capital yield and lower vol@@ ati@@ lity still exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at the average each 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; they could see profits from higher y@@ ields , even if experts are different from thinking that will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM Council worth a member of Andrew B@@ ingham
the conserv@@ atives member of the parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the sender because of his &quot; gener@@ alization &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards and said that she was just The Br@@ its
Parliament &apos;s group of Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins reached the show The Voice and said that this is not so original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , holds a leader member and increases new pressure on the radio station to prove that he does something what the private sender do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham was also the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the publicly @-@ term radic@@ als &quot; was sil@@ ly &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguish from its commercial competition . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 sh@@ ines - I do not use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards held in the last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its appear to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; the BBC &apos;s director , pointed the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is well ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals , when it comes to live music and clarification of the public . &quot;
what I learn from Radio 3 l@@ erne and I am nowhere to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that really is uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the dedication of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works to be commissioned , I consider also really important . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , believe will be tough@@ er to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , radio 3 was not the only member of the BBC production which took place during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for the purpose of taking the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins grip The Voice to - the musical talent show of BBC which was bought by Dutch producers of Tal@@ pa Media for a total of 22 million £ .
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - was produced with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Jud@@ ge .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company is taking a hit from our house @-@ in barn , when the next time it comes to a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to make ordering another rows of The Voice for the future or budget@@ ing money of the pay@@ ers for other specialty formats . &quot;
Internet rail@@ ings stu@@ ds in August at the lang@@ sam@@ sten and the Black Friday can be held responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month saw the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by the use of phones to shop
experts believe that Black Friday has stopped in November Friday in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping mile has burned down and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into violin . &quot;
&quot; experts say that there are now signs of online deposits , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure on August presented the lowest increase in growth since the year 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs of online sales figures after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the years and go back in 2000 , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y said , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ sales correspondence the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales were strengthened three years ago , as a buyer set to make shopping with their mobile phones . &quot;
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments such as home on the sofa .
&quot; but now it is like that , and we may possibly experience that growth reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America , is quoted as a reason for the decline of revenues . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers have their purchases against this event , held last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers op@@ ed ones . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer would be fought for snor@@ ing , buyers from what purchases need to do . &quot;
a study of British Retail Con@@ sortium found a little bit more than 1 £ 0 .
&quot; with some products like TV and laundry machines , more than one third of the purchases now available on web shops . &quot;
at the same time more than a quarter of men &apos;s clothing and shoes online instead of staying in the inter@@ iors into the interior .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane @-@ accident Get@@ uns - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims with the first bur@@ ial items in Mec@@ ca through the streets

&quot; the Ministry of Health says that also a total of 3@@ 94 people were in@@ ju@@ red , after the crane cr@@ ashes ... &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves when 29 of the victims were carried out by the streets to bury the ones who were killed , as being a crane at Mec@@ ca el@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; they filled themselves , largely in white dressed , the distance to z@@ ew their respect when the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Mo@@ or@@ em @-@ cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the grape proc@@ ession went to the Holy site , where only days before a building crane by the v@@ eiling of the mosque , and then on the bed over@@ thre@@ w . &quot;

&quot; among the dead was both Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane was crossed . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch at the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officers have already pointed out that the H@@ add@@ sch after Mec@@ ca will continue to achieve the city , continue to go on . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said , the Am @-@ Laden @-@ group would not have to ste@@ al the arm of the sick , than he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decre@@ e , which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking Service of the message agency reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s guidance should not be banned . &quot;
&quot; at the start of this week Pro@@ man praised sal@@ ads , which caused the overthrow of the crane who thre@@ w them into an inner courtyard of the grand@@ children , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims sat before the p@@ addle , which later gathered in this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group does not have any statements regarding the collapse of these crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree hat@@ ch@@ ored the group because of not current safety measures and because they do not cooperate with mete@@ or@@ ites .

B &amp; Q Boss said that the time of cheap Eastern European craft@@ spe@@ ople is over
&quot; increasingly reli@@ ed on craft@@ sman , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of qualified professionals from Eastern Europe has the increase behind
&quot; this also leads to 200 more pre@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen . &quot;
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q retail outlets is close
&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , city Chef @-@ correspondence of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it will be asser@@ ted that British pay their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen , carried out their work in their home &quot;
if you are sent with a hammer or a brush for controll@@ able from walls , you still belong to a minority . &quot;
&quot; because British are increasingly professionals in order to do do @-@ it jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Véronique Lau@@ ry , new business leader of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the farmer &apos;s chain , said that a great increase in the number of qualified professionals from Eastern Europe , offer services to high @-@ grounds , is now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 more pres@@ t@@ aller to shop@@ pers who are directed to craft@@ spe@@ ople and to make 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to find more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are taken by women . &quot;
at the moment the men weigh the men .
&quot; she said it is necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends , which have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our departments .
we need to shift this stronger and balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a huge part in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , a leading company by just five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed company , has also included her top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company owned by 50 percent of the team occupied by women , including its management and financial status . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate choice - diversity is an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Super@@ visory boards .

functional : A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; at the municipal court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt , you have to master two functions of the Austrian volleyball world vice @-@ band A@@ ich / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and shoot . &quot;
the accused would not be guilty of this .
one of them was also charged with religious missionary .
by this accus@@ ation he was un@@ power@@ fully engaged in May Law .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the Robert Ri@@ ffel ( in 2006 ) , Robert Ri@@ ffel had joined in the pre @-@ investigations that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 are mon@@ at work of associations , about which they were dispos@@ ed in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage was reduced with around 400,000 Euros . &quot;
the sports functional ones are also charged with financial crises .
&quot; this principle was the chairman of the entrance gate , called Micha@@ ela San@@ in , . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to the accus@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represents that the association had never emerged as a asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports functional had only been calculated compens@@ ated and the Sport@@ club , which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and had invested a lot of time and money from debt - the passi@@ v@@ us@@ ement in 2001 approximately 60@@ 0.000 m@@ illing ( rd . 44.@@ ,000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we continue to hide or lock the club &quot; , &quot; told one of the accused , in the funeral of the financial vocation of the financial sector . &quot;
&quot; then he decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , at the same time . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have paid money , our life insurance for security in the bank was &quot; &quot; went &quot; , &quot; he said at the rede@@ mption . &quot;
the association was agreed : you can manage the money free there must only be no debts .
&quot; furthermore , even if the corresponding financial success was adopted - the payout of the alleg@@ ations was postpon@@ ed until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the nec@@ essi@@ ties have only been paid for years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus is paid to the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there will also be l@@ ump in l@@ ump and not detail bookings , explained the former Ob@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ au@@ ans managed by the two def@@ endants , said the second accused . &quot;
why the association had not been marked in detail before the association asked Jud@@ ge .
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial recovery , which only has been the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 against the temporary investigations , an amount of 120,000 euros have been transferred to the association . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ gru@@ ff had been , &quot; the accused . &quot;
&quot; this report was based on the names of the other def@@ endants , and was not known by the association , according to the above @-@ mentioned association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
&quot; after this , the in@@ quired did not know a long answer . &quot;
&quot; then he said , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known something of this money , the prosec@@ utor has been introduced to the space . &quot;
&quot; the compl@@ ained has been informed , justi@@ fies the functional ones . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &apos; in@@ dem@@ nity .
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? what did the judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
&quot; to this question , the first accused , he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association has never formed a defect . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the couns@@ el says , &quot; with whom you are all out of the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the functional , he never did one cent higher content , he used only o@@ dom@@ eters and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; for the diet he has charged 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
exact records for the early years could not pre @-@ present the accused .
&quot; these are after the inspection , in which everything was judged as correct , not more preserved , explained . &quot;
o@@ eter@@ ism had also referred to the second accused .
&quot; all containers are within cash , to do so , from his place of residence of the international market to the Bank to St@@ agn@@ es , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings will continue on September 23 with the consultation of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the US government
&quot; the world is ob@@ serving when the US is database within two days , on Wednesday and Thursday coming together to make an important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade is raised the interest rates . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists who questioned by Reu@@ ters , found that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue a little longer and will keep interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 per cent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL . &quot;

&quot; the police in the Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that &apos;s represented by Ge@@ ography and Social Scientific Education of the Delta State University , the emergency number on 10 : 00 am Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and said , he was shot on someone and someone is killed . &quot;
he represented the staff of the emergency that the police polic@@ emen came to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I forgot my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he did mention that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house , that &quot; &quot; no one will inter@@ fere , &quot; but will likely be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller named after his name , but he did not deliver him . &quot;
Lamb is no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as the police investigate the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , which said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I would und@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved . &quot;

&quot; university president William La@@ For@@ ge said , he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was a little bit of Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s conception . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the lam@@ b supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there was &quot; no information &quot; no evidence &quot; of a &quot; tri@@ une relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was created by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were approximately seven years old when a &quot; good person &quot; described . &quot;

&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and they may be destroyed . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , by statement by Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , who had represented with him for about three years . &quot;

&quot; the aim of the new real@@ ign@@ ment is a contribution of about 500 million euros per year and in@@ sol@@ uble syner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play months due to double cheer@@ fulness
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double penetration of his right position in the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven .
&quot; while doing so the left @-@ wing def@@ enders for crying and ex@@ clude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al is not hoping that Sha@@ w can be played in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno after the 20 year old Sha@@ w in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated only nine minutes on the board and needed oxygen before it was brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has double leg in the hospital and lies in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later , and then in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s hard and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mas@@ ke .
he cri@@ ed .
&quot; I &apos;m not a Doctor , but if you have a double vision , then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
&quot; Moreno seemed happy to be a red map and the suspension of an ace , escap@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Nicola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not pen@@ alised the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had to be mist@@ aken .
&quot; they can judge for themselves , when I say that a misery and a red map are due . &quot;
it was a very serious attack with two legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account ass@@ ed : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can not describe how do I get , my path to recovery starts now , I come back more quickly . &quot;
moved here : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with the defeat at the PS@@ V
England &apos;s def@@ enders has an additional incentive to recover from the European Championship in France until June next .
&quot; Philli@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very sharp violation . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury are all very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt your opponent .
Moreno suffered a epith@@ eli@@ ft while Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als The Netherlands team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and if you then hear it is a very aw@@ ful injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said C@@ oc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in a different direction , so it didn &apos;t see as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 , Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels like I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad there . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; as he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister decided on The Lor@@ ax , which was created in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , and writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or a message we have ever missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which David pur@@ pos@@ ely reported the act of the book , instead featured a table representing the film version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to bro@@ aden the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , he hopes to attract a young man named Ted , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , his father of Au@@ dre@@ y , his rich@@ ly name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss f@@ uss and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that has not been suspected : the text reads from Cameron already reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie theatres , which is presented on the Internet Movie Database , and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a good , hopes to win a boy named Ted , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is allowed to be a prag@@ matic Father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the action of the book so little familiar . here is an un@@ familiar boy , like the local environment through the cas@@ h@@ iring , trees fal@@ si@@ zing , be@@ ur@@ b@@ ular beings , which speaks in the name of trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a volunteer committee , who did not read the Lor@@ ax 20 times with a child in a short distance . &quot;
&quot; a down@@ ing street speaker , said that the text probably came from Camer@@ ons elect@@ oral office . &quot;
&quot; Super@@ camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons have been delivered , but there were no further immediate comment . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was obviously threatened by the exclusion from England , but it is still hard . &quot;
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you selected the cad@@ res the England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not ex@@ clude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ looks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing assembly , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not wear scar@@ ring from 2012 , only a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een develops Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an un@@ familiar size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; in this case , Adam Ly@@ th depart@@ ing from the England test cad@@ res and will be replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , is of course hard for me as his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that the thri@@ lling player are based on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark in Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said this - Player their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one could have extended the course of poetry , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; when he suggests other L@@ runs in Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is added . &quot;
&quot; the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he did not get such good performance , and this is not surprising me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test stroke will get to make his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do hom@@ e- and down@@ ward .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can rise , was that England first wrote Jonathan Liv@@ t in the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in the Caribbean , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a stroke that I appreciate highly . &quot;
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ tic player that we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he got 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent bridge and achieved what we met .
&quot; it has to receive at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends of course on the split adjustment in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea , Mo@@ een to beat Cook , which would bring a extra spin @-@ pun@@ ish and four mer@@ icks would get , and I have nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a stroke can not beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket player . &quot;
&quot; she might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ ces@@ ter@@ shire , but it &apos;s a number 3 for them and there is no difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before it joined 2001 as an Op@@ ener . &quot;
he immediately got away a hundred R@@ us and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as Back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people might want to see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a plot , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ ans who have their hands and the coaches have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the crew , England has made some smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Neu@@ awar@@ am , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the testing games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest people of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as he played amongst all the conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and for@@ c@@ eful use into the setup .
&quot; I have always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as Coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously mentioned ones . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ i &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , is not used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I for my part did not have a problem with it . &quot;
some will not agree but coaches and Team@@ work do not determine the schedule .
they must remember that as they depend on players their jobs on the results .
such decisions are not made light heart .
the Bre@@ xit @-@ camp ( Bre@@ xit = exit side of Britain from the EU ) could be gaining access to Zul@@ u if the economy is in a fin@@ alized base by 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced neo @-@ making strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get more deeply into trouble with each day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C who was sh@@ attered around for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at fan and said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angl@@ ed in different crises , such as the EU is now and not always of their own fault , Britain &apos;s own ranks with a seg@@ reg@@ ation treaty provisions that they usually do not want to be filled . &quot;
&quot; in Bright@@ on , TU@@ C decided on their annual general meeting that it does not like this even when they thre@@ aten the social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; minister and finance minister climb@@ s on meetings or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , make a photo of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they will win alliances for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes to be an in@@ active UK inside the EU &apos; tent &apos; - &apos; let us not alone with France &apos; , says Berlin - and leaves that more and more short @-@ sight@@ ed Minister and officials came to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an association , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the ministry before it looks bad for her as it was done badly for her as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President François Hollande can look back to his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ ending force .
&quot; Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist sovereign government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will be a blo@@ c to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even have ill@@ iter@@ ate any helpful notes , quite in the SN@@ P style , during the British referendum , to accelerate the Bre@@ xit @-@ process , thought my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt &quot; and &quot; great Britain has won nothing about the value of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how r@@ ari@@ ber@@ ish can be the Fle@@ et Street on their cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the Pres@@ is@@ ar@@ one as they did during the by Tony Ben@@ n inspiring speaker du@@ ms 1975 but not been that our entry into 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; they can be weak at Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ unity , who has made a name for itself as an &quot; EU @-@ called ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
during all his mad@@ ness I knew Ed Mili@@ band who were his enemies .
&quot; this was followed by the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing jack@@ ets , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening countries and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ foreigners , most of our great newspapers . &quot;
actually Tony Bl@@ air actually thought about her but was firm that if you were sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage allowing better ban@@ anas to distr@@ act him instead of having lunch and dinner .
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , when he was accused of Camer@@ ons Advisor , as Bl@@ air had turned the principle on the EU adopted by French and Dutch voters to open it back to him . &quot;
the press has never seen him too .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he was no more time for me to be wast@@ ed - seems to repeat the danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ y@@ ott Mur@@ ing strategy of the 80 @-@ hundred years , an error back then and now . &quot;
&quot; it may take but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe is - I express it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blast@@ oc@@ ular tendency and the wil@@ der@@ ous vessels of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ English , everyone can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and on television this week said , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ he years , when his old father himself stro@@ ve to his faithful , loyal to his Labour @-@ cabinet cabinet , without losing too far and to lose his cab@@ inet@@ d job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ky &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight in order to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; to remain &quot; Benn@@ ett &quot; - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow meetings and members according to all reports on their statement on Monday . &quot;
&quot; what ever wants to convey the Bl@@ ender @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a brood @-@ centre of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no freedom of registration for Europe who allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ dum@@ tic campaign , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks of so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ ui@@ ties on EU membership - in accordance with its Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ ulation economy - its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion of the left disc@@ othe@@ que which is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
&quot; as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not have a campaign for the outlet , the foreign diplom@@ ats will be oblig@@ ated to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin should w@@ asting a political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ es@@ sions to the British , if this cannot be meaning@@ less . &quot;
&quot; the US has already disappointed quite disappointed with the weak military achievement in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with an expense of the T@@ ory government in power , I was reminded of something that was recorded on Monday by British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts cri@@ tici@@ ze report of public health England on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes was less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 persons , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , &quot; said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined The Lanc@@ et by cri@@ tici@@ ze the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
p@@ he published the &quot; Mani@@ fes@@ to &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the tough@@ ness of data and transferred to the ties between several experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial board in the medical journal Rz@@ g@@ ish last month attacked the &quot; &quot; very win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; on the p@@ he his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; another researcher wants to write in BM@@ J , and have asked whether the claims they build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ etown , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that the proposition is made by p@@ oth , that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of post @-@ wise and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria @-@ decision Analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions about the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ etown said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director has previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Medium ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting agreed to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding they have received after reports before by the Tab@@ ak@@ companies Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of members of the body are not delivered , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes , some of which also provide some industrial funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco industry .
the session also took part in the tobacco management of p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; cur@@ ly signs &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products with most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Chicago . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ri said that the claims of p@@ hic that &quot; there are no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes will serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers .
&quot; professional F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that on the claims of BM@@ J was already respon@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addi@@ ction .
&quot; all evidence put close that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to that are low , but that we still have the long @-@ term impact . &quot;
&quot; he has the unique obligation to inform the public about what the evidence is occupied and what is not , particularly when there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers of tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die yearly from a disease with regard to smoking and smoking costs the national health system two billion euros per year . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clear advantages of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders - says ex Chief of Channel 4
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC would cease to send programmes such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; will give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should be used only to make the type of programs that are not sent through other sub @-@ channels .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC that they are considered public @-@ legal programs which are likely to be seen by a smaller public , in hard cont@@ enti@@ ous periods against the most popular shows of its ri@@ vals and by broad@@ cast@@ ers as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC &apos;s Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he continued for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success with the BBC in terms . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC would like to create programs or sends , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ structured ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson &apos;s Upper @-@ Communication @-@ Committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broad@@ casting fee , which I consider in the medium or long term , one should stop its production at least to programs that do not do or order . &quot;
they send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to reach as much a wide support for their future as possible .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it is natural . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both of @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm to it . &quot;
I am trying to see me how this is public @-@ right TV .
I don &apos;t believe that this would adopt the BBC ever at all .
&quot; Johnson , a repr@@ en@@ eur for series , Channel 4 from 2004 until 2010 said that the BBC has to blame for the &quot; hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to maintain long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most fav@@ oring broad@@ casts of BBC , give back what the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ diary presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 schedule that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal N@@ ish programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they argue for their own sacred missions for the justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ broad@@ casting fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have seen all these obsc@@ ure programs which no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; to the radio station , Johnson said the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather rainy system in terms of conditions that can get the best value below . &quot;
&quot; of course , think of all , think that one receives a great value for 150 £ each year , but for those who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , for they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC would examine their Rei@@ se Mission to provide and entertain . &quot;
he said that only little by the BBC @-@ production would now be classified as education - he said that it &apos;s 1 % of their TV Production and 0.1 % to the radio station - and she should take an example in public @-@ related TV broad@@ casting in Australia and Canada . for example , clarify and entertain . &quot;
&quot; to question the partnerships did El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , whom he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial tran@@ smit@@ ters to make everything online available . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by c@@ rank@@ shafts .

scientists have bred the wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by cre@@ ws of c@@ rank@@ shafts .
&quot; tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des signs the direction right now , in which they have with sound impul@@ ses , which have heard for the human hearing too high frequencies to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impul@@ ses are working through the power of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ as@@ ound shafts . &quot;
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new trial , called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , used in ultr@@ as@@ ound ultr@@ as@@ ound body , in order to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of the brain stimulation , the electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread people usually do not respond to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani made firm that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out to reinforce the ultr@@ ash@@ light waves then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultr@@ asonic @-@ waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms cells .
&quot; the c@@ rank@@ shafts do effect the opening of these ion channels , as well as activate the cells that are assigned to it , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ as@@ ound Nem@@ ato@@ s , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ous TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels have to be toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if ultr@@ as@@ ound ultr@@ as@@ ound among these changed creatures , the sound@@ waves are enhanced by the micro@@ bl@@ ings and turn into the wor@@ ms , where they activate the modified mot@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetic tool , a tr@@ ail@@ bl@@ az@@ ing tool , which enables scientists to allow ne@@ ural with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
&quot; but Chal@@ as@@ o@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics might have some advantages over this technique , &quot;
&quot; contrary to light that has to be sent to an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ as@@ ound tissue can happen immen@@ sely and can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible , the stri@@ pped human neur@@ ons are temporarily pr@@ one to the ultr@@ as@@ ound treatments in a clinical setting for certain neurological procedures , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student dormit@@ ory
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ fulness 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormit@@ ory , but only now I remember the tense sm@@ iles which I have refused - and to the numerous , leg@@ ic complaints about others . &quot;
most what I learned is di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the influ@@ x of student dormit@@ ories extends from slightly nerve wre@@ cking up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to de@@ wat@@ ering : people tell wh@@ ence you come , where and where you &apos;ve been put in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you can &quot; frank@@ ly &quot; Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in Ernst , guys , there is only a stap@@ le tap to ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe out .
and help others to do the same - Make any questions and show interest .
it inter@@ acts the conversation and helps you find out the people that you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak even if your eyelashes did in fire and that fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages - recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
compared : do not remember when university begins with a relationship ?
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted receive a gro@@ ove of treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refu@@ ge , yet many students form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ bath culture , which can be friendly and socially and is a life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be a hell for someone who is trying to recover , &quot;
&quot; nothing in culture allowed to say to you : &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want to go away our friendship , but you need to go away , so that I have burnt the energy for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a cl@@ as@@ sm@@ ates is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send it to an SMS instead .
A@@ pro@@ pos ank@@ lo@@ ine : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ory had the idea that a didn &apos;t eng@@ ul@@ ent door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship through fre@@ aking .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of back @-@ man@@ ia , the monastery is at the doors of people to present themselves with a dish full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd as the welcome of 1950 @-@ he years &apos; welcome in the neighborhood , I have to smile , if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade jams is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
&quot; your ro@@ omm@@ ates are obliged to entertain yourself , and will in the end perhaps to associate your face with a delicious surprise . &quot;
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery . &quot;
poorly mixed l@@ ump of fl@@ our , sugar and fat lead to them sleeping , when you fall asleep . &quot;
foods to ste@@ al is an independent crime in student dormit@@ ory .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is a rob@@ bery , but is it just taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
re@@ viewing this with the milk @-@ owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say themselves to serve themselves , even if they are in the inside . &quot;
&quot; when anyone sh@@ ep@@ ed your stuff , is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to handle them more balanced than my ro@@ ommate who added a r@@ ins@@ ant to overcome them . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent human being but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the end to the people who sit in the glass house .
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbours to ask them something else , drum &amp; bass something qui@@ eter , because it was 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted to more so with worse music .
&quot; when they finally heard about 5 p.m. , they gave their neighbors remain two hours sleeping before she shut down their own music , shut her door shut down , and walk in her three @-@ hour examination . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen by chance at the same student residence ?
&quot; what is the other way around , it would not be ground@@ ed rather aw@@ k@@ ward if you have a ro@@ ommate for your future partner , to get to them again and then join it every day and maybe experience how to bring all common friends to himself ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own paths - but when a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future partner , try at least to talk to your lower reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has his key in his not eng@@ ed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing is just when it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good strike is funny , but it only takes moments , until he becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place through hiding a valuable and am@@ using L@@ ess@@ on about security - but never do someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ amp@@ oo .
&quot; shut her door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you can then put in the free@@ zer -- but sm@@ aking her pos@@ sessions at the ceiling no more than twice fixed . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will be pushing for a member market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or Turn@@ h@@ all has no sustainability .
because people stay a great part here .
&quot; given the refugee current , we need plenty of living space in the coming decades . &quot;
a very mund@@ ane and tri@@ angular limb@@ o is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a tourist house needs a least square .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different when people un@@ blocks the people in housing blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , is composed of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be re@@ arranged according to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; tor@@ tie : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is charged with 184 000 Euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction took .
this is reasonable .
building rules for their plans are complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I have been correct my project correctly .
particularly complicated it makes it an end @-@ end d@@ amo@@ cl@@ er value and the Stell@@ bur@@ ation order .
cre@@ epy .
&quot; there is still inter@@ tw@@ ining who creates three apartments in a san@@ atorium house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the inhabitants have responded to their Rei@@ h@@ ouses project ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have thrown me , lux@@ uries for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what is definitely not true .
but wh@@ ites you not put the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but has been built a luxury apartments that can hardly afford a lot . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but likewise the alone mother or the righteous . &quot;
I am showing how to build cheap and well @-@ built today .
that is why it works .

iOS 9 : how to receive the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Adjust@@ ment app , click &quot; General &quot; and then &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when ready is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install the installation . &quot;
some are pushed after the installation to problems as they get an error message that fails to susp@@ end the &quot; update @-@ update . &quot;
&quot; to deal with the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may sound the delet@@ ing of apps to create space - but Apple has done that through the dis@@ agreement of the updates , it will be simpler to do this if one is using a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it once the process has completed . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s worth to ensure that your mobile phone is rech@@ ar@@ ged during the update , or is located close to a charge device , making the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the cargo is too low , Apple does not admit that the update will continue , as the phone might turn off halfway and this could lead to a dismant@@ ling of the updates . &quot;
&quot; more : iOS 9 release still timetable in schedule in spite of the watch@@ OS delays in checking of iOS 9 : the least exciting , but the best update of iOS 9 : how to prepare for the new iPhone operating system . &quot;
&quot; you should also make sure that you &apos;ve seen before your download our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things to prevent things going wrong and to protect yourself , if they us@@ ht@@ . iOS 9 brings new features , including a much more wis@@ er personal assistant and enormous new productive features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and restore the operating system . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice in the field of fields and invest EUR 3@@ 10000 Euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; we are also happy for Sam@@ t@@ ep@@ ist@@ or@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Cooperation in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
in many places in the country doctors - As@@ endorf opposed it &apos;s luck : Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice in the field .
&quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ber &apos;s retirement in retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing to his successor over the next few months later . &quot;
&quot; after an expansion phase Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then it has invested 3@@ 10000 Euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first glance , when Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently manages her medical practice in the For@@ ward Hospital , and who wants to interv@@ ene also in practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ber and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I made it just inv@@ oked . &quot;
the Couple Müller enjoyed the idea of operating in As@@ endorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and permanent contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to meet and accompany families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see his own boss as well . &quot;
&quot; and so one was agreed , the gar@@ bage bought it purchased the house with the practice . &quot;
living will continue to be in el@@ hausen Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there is the two @-@ fold family pension Frank Müller also attended , his medical inst@@ or@@ ship in Hannover and watched these stations in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is active as a senior doctor in Sul@@ ingen , he also became a leader in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz , and he is engaged and engaged in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Ter@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
from the 19th of September the practice for the new boss is prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ al is working as a veterinary surgeon who has specialised in Ur@@ sel Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) at the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
&quot; the gar@@ bage dump , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , are interested in a general practitioner . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes thus out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after re@@ modeling the rooms will be modern .
we will offer further ultr@@ as@@ ound exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and pay@@ load EK@@ GS and need a talk room more .
&quot; additionally , the ED@@ V is completely re@@ done . &quot;
&quot; a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 Euros granted the gar@@ bage under a funding programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) , as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is on @-@ going , &quot; &quot; stresses &apos;s deb@@ stri@@ ker Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; approximately 2000 patients come to the practice of Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll each quarter in the practice field , in the north @-@ German aver@@ ag@@ gling practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is another land@@ arz@@ t@@ pra@@ xis .
a positive effect of the practice @-@ effect obtained by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if not a successor would have found it would also have gone .
&quot; who attended the officer or one hour , is by the way continues to look in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialist and the cleaning power of the field sides . &quot;
with whose part@@ ing ends in As@@ endorf a era before all the medical devices have been practi@@ sed for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot;
after a little nostal@@ gia they feel after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue living in Hohen@@ moor and will see many patients still often , &quot; says the dormit@@ ory . &quot;
&quot; your man is suppl@@ emented : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have always pressed I have been pressed , but this could be a different one . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also bound to our border , &quot; &quot; Interior of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel with this .
&quot; however , be sure that anyone who wants to make a asylum application , this could also be &quot; granted . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; but it is clear that clear signals needed , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
people need to know that bor@@ der@@ less migration flows are not accepted neither on the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
Croatian government had announced that Slovenia wants to continue coming down refugees in Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances can be cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees too .
&quot; in this , the interior of the Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar in Stav@@ anger is not . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia is the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the border of the Schengen area . &quot;
as the Minister magni@@ fied that he wants to mar@@ vel in so with its limits to refugees but not abria .
&quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system may not function , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already been trying to set the first refugees in the evening hours on Tuesday , in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to rec@@ ede to the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could draw their attention in the nearby cor@@ n@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the company has constantly developed law cars with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Sy@@ rer and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also lif@@ ter and the Red Cross are already in action .
&quot; in the coming days its country with around 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; moreover , buses from the evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported the Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade however , however , that it is the people trying to make certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor do we want this , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , at any rate in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrive at the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were the whole night about 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has promised , so the police have said that we should come here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; with this , it could actually turn the previous shift to the previous Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Serbia to a somewhat further west stretch . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s interior of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously empha@@ sized that his country has been prepared for the case of a strong regime of refugees , for possible forms of potential configur@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t mention it , but he pointed out that Croatia served as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
maintain tight controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner since then is going through a good testimony of what the standard of border controls are concerned . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , there are still some 300 refugees on the Hungarian border @-@ border . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing H@@ org@@ os , who came to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border crossing H@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees now wish to reach the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm part at a local hero in H@@ org@@ os : he consider the debates on alternative approaches of refugees , since the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature . &quot;
it would not be a very high amount of refugee .
&quot; one could not say whether they would continue their trip on Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers rates migrants - dangerous - altern@@ ative floods
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee camps have already begun to spread to the refugees of land , where alternative routes are indicated throughout Croatia . &quot;
&quot; the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian , still not vac@@ ated min@@ ef@@ ields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine @-@ spatial in the border region was sent .

&quot; all things are about living , therefore we are with the action in the middle of the city and among men gone , &quot; Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer said . &quot;

&quot; therefore , this public relations to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old must be good . &quot;
&quot; if anyone want to communicate publicly on the tablets , however , is comprehen@@ sible , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the issue of death and dying is still retained by tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although it &apos;s just the recent years that the Hosp@@ es movement has helped many things to open themselves in the last few years . &quot;

Fed@@ Ex result mixed , final prospects for 2016 cut &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports betra@@ y@@ y results for the last quarter , and the supply Gi@@ ants lo@@ wered his winn@@ ings on one year due to the weaker demand for freight @-@ transport and higher costs in its land transport service . &quot;
&quot; the firm also said that she is planning to get about 5@@ 5,000 cars for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company would want to stop the 50,000 b@@ ending workers for the holiday period . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 per cent in the Pre @-@ market @-@ trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn an gain between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the current financial year that ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than at previous forecast . &quot;
an@@ al@@ ysts expected to be expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the lower view comes despite the survey , which are an average of 4.4 percent and be effective on January 4 , despite higher cuts for soil transpor@@ ters of heavy and large packages , which are collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it still expect the result to increase the result compared to the previous year due to rei@@ sen@@ ing , higher revenues and due to growth in the online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; solid income y@@ ields &quot; &quot; mean that the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade , are taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holiday employment were repeated a day later than those of the Rival UPS announced that plans , 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5.000 extra labour , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million earned $ , 6 percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amount to € 49 per share , just behind the $ 44 per share , the twelve of the acks of investment research asked an@@ al@@ ysts . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the packs were expecting an@@ al@@ ysts expected to 12,@@ 23 billion . &quot;
Fed@@ Ex has seen a decline in the international pri@@ ori@@ ente@@ ering shipping sector in recent years , which brought sales to the economy in its unity Express delivery . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has raised the results via Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales growth of the ground transport rose by 29 per cent , but the operational result was mainly flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ assurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit registered higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result due to higher labour costs in the freight @-@ shop . &quot;
&quot; market trading , about an hour before the opening , rech@@ arge the Fed@@ Ex shares by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
on Tuesday she concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 per cent at a record high@@ t on 11th June .
&quot; at their most expected meeting in the year Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table , in order to decide whether it is time for the first time in nearly a decade to highlight the console . &quot;
&quot; Dro@@ ho@@ end on them at one end of the first , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed sitting set @-@ sitting is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
&quot; the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ et , and her colleagues are supposed to put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things . &quot;
the central bank has a two @-@ way order of Congress : maxim@@ ize the US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the large recession the F@@ ed guides have acknowledged it &apos;s a miserable , third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; this third mandate would be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ di@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to sp@@ rep@@ el the unprecedented interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data in the economy seem that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets already inten@@ sely make these vol@@ ati@@ lity often due to raising the interest rate for government bonds - and be it only by a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is first and foremost to be the most important that they observe , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ists in the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased security around the global market will continue to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , what the financial market itself is uns@@ ett@@ led . &quot;
&quot; about half of the mon@@ stro@@ kes that were recently inter@@ viewed from Bloom@@ berg , a Zin@@ co @-@ cave is predicted this week . &quot;
&quot; however , financial markets expect an exit from the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , it is that the str@@ at@@ ves hit the impact , by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was held by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or around 1,@@ 4 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 99@@ ,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations , that the F@@ ed politics is continuing to carry the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , boss at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she is doing it , &quot; she needs to go very far in her explanation to calm financial markets so that they don &apos;t get into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a Zin@@ co @-@ cave would be calm to the financial markets , because they would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on good way to raise the set of proletarian percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of the spher@@ ical conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; y@@ ellen had said in spring and in early summer , despite the complaints of Liber@@ als , that they would require more economic advance , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wing down , the improvement in the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; unemployment rate sank to 5,@@ 1 % in the past month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
job wr@@ aps have shown signs of a recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly running under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the ed representatives said that the main reason the temporary impact of clearly lower oil prices was . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief of Pan@@ theon &apos;s Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but financial markets lived together over the world , at the end of the last month , after China had its currency . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage &quot; fell in May by more than 16 % of its peak , as investors feared that a slo@@ w@@ down of Chinese economy would increase global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered from this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now about 10 % under the high end of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence have significantly influence the complex calculation , when you would raise interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news did not occur about the weakness of the Chinese economy within the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at the U@@ C@@ LA C@@ inn@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the U.S. database . &quot;
&quot; now he pre@@ di@@ ct that she will wait at least a month , to get the impact better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be affecting the U.S. economy and there is nearly no reliable information that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the principal min@@ ers of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in their decision making . &quot;
but in the end it has become the F@@ ed monetary authorities of the world .
the influence of the central bank has had a tremendous impact over the past years .
&quot; the mere fact of the then Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ ank in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be &quot; &quot; cr@@ ust expansion &quot; &quot; and prov@@ oked tur@@ mo@@ ons around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly fond of each other , they can only monitor the developments in other countries , but also consult with other central banks and experts to find a better understanding of global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that month that &quot; the F@@ ed has linked a story of over@@ reactions to the financial market movements that seem to be associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acker , justi@@ fiable member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advocates the interests of zinc @-@ based decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its guidance into volume of 0,75 percent@@ ages in three meetings &quot; despite limited recognizable effects on growth in the US , &quot; said . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives did und@@ o this cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put on the first place aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis as a &quot; &quot; re@@ unification of 2008 &quot; , &quot; said Adam S. Pozn@@ an , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the latest tur@@ mo@@ il do not come close to this level , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to get into the situation where they are afraid of a interests , because the markets opens up , &quot; &quot; said Posen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t believe that they should be hur@@ ry of the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
&quot; to prepare you a warm welcome , does not work without the commitment of unt@@ ing@@ sof@@ ten@@ ing hel@@ pers . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ an .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
also written with their 74 L@@ encies she is still learning .
every Thursday she is doing her in the asylum seeker in the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .

Brazil &apos;s Brazilian Society Rio Grande nur@@ turing nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian organization SP@@ RS is trying to elu@@ ci@@ date women in the sho@@ cking way women , how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding mothers . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted with br@@ akes of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast @-@ milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies provide all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements will get pregnant and young mothers , their daily cal@@ orie intake increased by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ä@@ te@@ tical adjustment that should make the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet often affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet for the child can affect the immune system negative . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ hardt of the sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried un@@ approved the construction order for the 2.3 million euros in the sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat@@ ter for solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ hall@@ ing of sports premises are proceeding well as a step forward : in the recent municipal council meeting , the finished construction work was coordinated without great discussions included . &quot;
&quot; earlier , the Panel had decided among other things a proposal for a new legal &quot; exemp@@ tive &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form on the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; saddle @-@ roof with non @-@ w@@ aged first and roof @-@ level is to be established . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the proposed use of the roof space for solar power plants : &quot; as such we get a wonderfully large south @-@ roof , &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in turn , &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; in turn around the sky@@ slope that originate from energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan of evolution - under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan relating to the ro@@ ar had no &quot; exceptions &quot; - the ber@@ ber of the com@@ mon@@ at usually goes even more restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; but in turn , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the athle@@ ech@@ at@@ ement at the Sports Center is a collaborative project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2,@@ 3 million euros have been calculated .
subsidies are expected from the school and gr@@ ass@@ ail@@ ment support .
&quot; in the next process of procedure , the building contract for the 18 x 36 meters large hall now has to be tabl@@ ed to the county seat . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ gh@@ berg will be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) of new medical director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ gh@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; seeing the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the estate , which confirmed the land@@ holder Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on the line of the Super@@ visory Board , and the Board of Directors to meet on the following Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees spent at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ gh@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority of solar panels are cat@@ ching with fishermen and from an existing inner station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees , who cannot go with Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a place in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; it has triggered the change by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of the year &apos;s doctor Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik and is now moving to a private office in direct proximity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; to the question who is scheduled to follow the follow @-@ up came , according to Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , who agreed to take over management of 1 October and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this appears in each case a &quot; &quot; enhancement &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the range in the &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
fishermen is a specialist for cardiovascular and defi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior stop on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; in comparison to the next two years , fishermen have to agree with his team when the Super@@ visory Board will lead to the following two houses , until then last year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ rais@@ al , which is expected to be completed over 35 beds in P@@ ei@@ gh@@ berg , after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the County had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment was completed by the Hospital in Wei@@ l@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; J@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , who is also President of the Super@@ visory Board , turned out ru@@ mo@@ urs , that the house , which is in possession of the Bundes@@ rat , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum @-@ fever . &quot;
&quot; I close it . as it moves with the real estate , Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White could not say it takes several refl@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; currently there , a short @-@ minute maintenance of the Car@@ itas and a city @-@ psychiat@@ ry occurs . &quot;
&quot; what better we could not happen , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; so Fischer war@@ ned over the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who had been received by the staff &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which fisher@@ man has worked as a boss , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to assume the post of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ gh@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was constantly threatened by closure , departments were shut down , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the palms of all the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar Leo are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 PM ) on the Berg@@ ischen HC demanded .
&quot; the tab@@ ular leaders of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal , the clear favorite , cause for its arrogan@@ ce , however , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; during the last season , the Bad@@ enes with the B@@ HC had an pain@@ less defeat and got a bit g@@ ill out there . &quot;

&quot; during the sti@@ cker on a cor@@ n@@ field in Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , there were several hunters in action , like the police press . &quot;
after a donation suffered a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year old man serious injury and were placed in hospitals .
&quot; how exactly it could come to an accident , was initially unclear . &quot;
the police criminal investigation should be determined .
miss 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate victims of violence
a crime dar@@ ken has led the police to the Lei@@ che of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate .
&quot; in the trial period , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave to the young people killed and their body was thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a since Saturday of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate is a non @-@ violent loss to the victim .
&quot; the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found at the camp in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern to Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as he awaits pro@@ secution and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; a stand still is said to be , also on the evening of 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who en@@ forced the phrase and investig@@ ators for the fund@@ ament of the Lei@@ che . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after they didn &apos;t have come home after a visit to a autumn day in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on Saturday evening .
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators is initially based on personal items from the victim . &quot;
in respon@@ dents in the friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the Ver@@ mi@@ sts finally sur@@ rendered a crime against the 20 @-@ year old .
&quot; the pre@@ disposition of the k@@ iller brought the police into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; the un@@ bi@@ ased gave the authorities in the police transm@@ itter , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put into the cor@@ pse on the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be pushed ahead at the harbour , the investig@@ ators put it down to the burden . &quot;
information on the circum@@ cis@@ ing circumstances of action shall bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ nings of residen@@ cy
the location on the German housing market is stra@@ ined .
increasingly more refugees seek a pre@@ paid lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing building stands in front of a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since started .
&quot; with the an@@ ur@@ in@@ coming refugees and people from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market , which is now over@@ bur@@ dened in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with income citizens about the last affordable housing .
&quot; to cover demand for paid apartments , would have to build 400,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
this result comes a study on the order of the ally &quot; social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; by comparison , this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are completed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; refugees are no longer obliged to live in the first three months of their stay , as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial holiday accommodation . &quot;
many then come across the apartment market and go into the long sn@@ akes in front of the flat rentals .
&quot; according to Statisti@@ cal Office , however , in the last year , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers come to rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the residential area is not just the rising of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing construction of recent years .
&quot; Germany fails to be a person deficit before , which will be bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; missing in the metropol@@ itan areas already around 77@@ 0,000 sleep units , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many colleagues lived therefore in large cities in large cities .
young adults stayed because of the floo@@ ding in the housing market un@@ voluntary longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square meter per cap@@ ita has declined in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the coalition &quot; social housing &quot; strikes a new start . &quot;
this action plan to boost new incentives for social housing .
so could be ab@@ st@@ ained on the admir@@ ation tax and the property tax for funded apartments are limited .
&quot; in addition , the alliance of attractive tax @-@ profit possibilities are necessary . &quot;
the sponsorship programme for refugee quot@@ ing of the Staats@@ bank K@@ f@@ W comes now well in towns and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start was Saturday , with 184 million Euros already more than half of the currently available approximately 300 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have a free p@@ ation : Croatia and Slovenia to reach Cor@@ ridor .
&quot; after Hungary there is practically no more to come , there are more refugees travelling to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb An@@ ends to grant transit through Slovenia to the North without any hur@@ dles .
but the route still is dangerous .
Croatia will communicate with the neighbouring land of Slovenia across the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian internal affairs , and if it is necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and has been part of the Schengen area .
EU @-@ country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
&quot; after the deportation of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have reached the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian TV station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had ch@@ ored its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws which entered into force on the same day , over@@ taking asylum @-@ procedures in Hungary virtually super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia will let the refugees happen .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic : &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who would not want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police had sei@@ zed the first refugees at the border of Serbia from the border to Serbia .
&quot; most of the media reports are reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came only by bus and taxi to the Serbian Grenz@@ stadt Si@@ d .
immediately after arriving they would have tried to get there on foot through the green border to Croatia .
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter the border . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border crossing many dangers . there are still sharp Min@@ es from the J@@ NA &apos;s Civil War in the 1990s . &quot;
min@@ ef@@ ields should now quickly create a safe passage .
after the closure of the border there are hardly any refugees .
on Tuesday the police had 36@@ 6 en@@ rag@@ ed people .
shortly before Tor@@ tor arrived on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws to overcome and dam@@ aging the border level joined us as a crime .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged I have also initiated 35 pen@@ al procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were five years deport@@ ees and deportation from the country to five years and its deport@@ ations out of the country . &quot;
&quot; after the immigration office , a total amount of 94 asylum seek@@ ers has been accepted on Tuesday to almost all - 93 - at the main transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; under the applicants , they are 13 families with young children as well as two elderly people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees trying .
&quot; however , virtually no one has given a prospect of given asylum in Hungary asylum . &quot;
&quot; after this view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should get there to the top . &quot;
in front of the &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ z@@ ke &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees gathered .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to dream in that way .
&quot; they gathered the tr@@ ash , which left the tens of thousands of people over the last few weeks by the road@@ side . &quot;
barrier f@@ ences were replaced and one of the audi@@ ences in the border town was rebuilt .
for the purpose of this construction nobody wanted to express itself .
Austria concluded a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also enhanced its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 immigrants raised in terms of government , but in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the way to Germany . &quot;
in the morning the train to Germany was stopped in the morning on the statement of German authorities .
&quot; in free@@ zing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot . &quot;
Mayor went &quot; Ges@@ tr@@ and@@ ete &quot; on the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the au@@ ction , when suddenly ten people were traveling with travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists ; they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; but because Germany was surprising to surprise for the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee period , which was immediately for@@ warded to it in W@@ ern@@ stein , so it was immediately for@@ ged with two hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into Pas@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before , we have only res@@ sed the un@@ expected guests only once , with fri@@ break and drink . &quot;
we immediately put it away and we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was of course for us &quot; , &quot; so for@@ kli@@ ft in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; a man did not let it take to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; this has been very happy , &quot; &quot; for@@ kli@@ ft &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the passengers in@@ exp@@ ended at the Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to pursue it after the short notice period that the railway traffic would be dis@@ continued to Germany , but still the border to try . &quot;
but the regional train was placed before the border into W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border in general high in the course .
&quot; the bridge @-@ firm together with the Bav@@ arian neighbors on Sunday soci@@ able , had previously been a two @-@ section spor@@ ty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends out more details to us , is a logical result of the apparent policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of being right at the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the construction of structures , humanity is publicly available , our Federal Chancellor , and publicly challenged the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ es of National Socialism . &quot;
Lei@@ d@@ speakers of this policy are not only those of the Austrian who are now facing the bor@@ dering areas with chaotic conditions .
&quot; the p@@ oul@@ try have to find that the &apos; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land , &quot; which they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; there will be a major challenge in face of the ongoing refugee streams and the nearby winter , with us human resources for seeking protection . &quot;
&quot; and there will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad on the search of 35.@@ 000 winter@@ holidays quar@@ ry
Konrad has full to do with the refugee treatment of all his hands .
Christian Konrad is used for his word weight .
the government has inserted the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker to provide the lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousand of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already already gained a handle .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came on Monday to Austria were without great tur@@ mo@@ il , &quot; says Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; competition . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Culture spoke on the other hand , by a &quot; cr@@ app@@ ish situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; altogether , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ iger year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number , the next few weeks will have to be found 35.@@ 000 accommodations - 20,000 should present those countries , 15,000 of the covenant . &quot;
&quot; should it take more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
by the state of the state he has already held talks .
they would have promised to it even for the coming refugees quot@@ a .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ al@@ atar is supporting Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , which should be settled , as the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; major expectations concerns the asylum @-@ ordinator also in the OR@@ F @-@ Action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is on the platform that individuals are able to offer complicated accommodation .
&quot; furthermore , one hopes to get hotels that will be empty during the winter . &quot;
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier cri@@ tici@@ zed yesterday the standard for accommodation as &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Not@@ ice , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ san should have to respect a certain amount of the hand @-@ holders or the size of the upper hand . &quot;
&quot; for a fixed time , &quot; &quot; rescue &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; that he is more successful in case of the treas@@ ury , when the accommodation is more successful , co @-@ founded on his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am a tur@@ istic Lord , whom you can not without any further face the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness be his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause any cost , as they explained themselves . &quot;
their employees want to increase them on three to four .
the own choice of accommodation has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the square Steph@@ an@@ splatz ( square miles ) as an office .
however there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz calls for a better location
until no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips arena and design centers for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; this is not necessary , as the person concerned would be able to refrain from those involved without these measures , says Mayor Klaus L@@ ug@@ er ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , further sites are to be tested for emergency purposes . &quot;
criticism of the city has been in the context of the division of Refu@@ ge@@ es within the Federal Republic .
also other areas must do their contribute here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bav@@ arian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) Landes@@ mann Josef P@@ ehr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday to set up further procedures in the refugee issue .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer found me reas@@ sured that German borders are not sealed .
the increase of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however there are now that the corresponding border controls will be put .
&quot; special conditions with refugees to Germany , there will be no more . &quot;
but the search @-@ seek@@ ers would however have taken into Germany with regular journeys to Germany .
from the other EU member states the fund for increased solidarity in the refugee issue .
&quot; that now Austria also goes back to its borders , is a logical consequence of &quot; emerg@@ es &quot; from the procedure of the Germans . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ er industrial foot@@ er is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the exchange office is one of the stock company S &amp; T entr@@ ust@@ ed , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is supposed to be rented to young , innovative companies from the supplier area . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ Chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine to invest in start@@ up @-@ companies of the New W@@ har@@ f and later to get started .
&quot; already from the start , S &amp; T he wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; about 7 million Euros was inv@@ ests by S &amp; T in the site , 3 million euros in the Tech@@ center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is from Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 27 square square metres in the building are rented , for another 40 percent give it requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the arc@@ ades
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are central to the center .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta wanted to lay with a dog in Jut@@ ta . &quot;
this project had to raise the 49 @-@ year @-@ old project by Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade short up@@ lift : after all , it now has been granted further growth in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; at the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business , in which they sold among other bags , suit@@ case , shoes and fabrics , various manufacturers , now all about Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ se are from 75 Euro . &quot;
&quot; larger po@@ ckets and accessories for up to 500 euros . &quot;
&quot; since yesterday , the new shop has been in operation . &quot;
&quot; previously , several weeks has been changed . &quot;
&quot; but I have long wondered whether I still want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; says broad . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things , that even the fur@@ la producers who are home in Bologna , from the idea of a dedicated location where only their Hand@@ bags are sold , taken with . &quot;
&quot; we are the noble in the Greater Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion @-@ interest has been boo@@ sted by her mother in the cradle .
&quot; I am di@@ pped in most , if something developed and I can show new trends at reasonable prices . &quot;
&quot; why there is so many women sitting on the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , could also answer the rac@@ ch with last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is used every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ am@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Lum@@ ber@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called in@@ am@@ or@@ ted .
this feature also links some of the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US President .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for @-@ off .
&quot; whether it is bound to dis@@ conc@@ ise hos@@ tile journalists , journalists or knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. Office of the President of the office will give you the strength of an election . &quot;
and cuts well on .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate milli@@ ard originated . &quot;
the New Yorker with the Cl@@ ose @-@ e@@ --@@ is a concept among many in the Win@@ zer@@ village at the wine @-@ road .
man@@ holes in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related via -@@ zig corners with him .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election campaign . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers know about his aim to be em@@ powered man of the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow we find it exciting , but are not deeply impressed in their striking species too , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ ey@@ ard has shot a am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous S@@ os@@ s@@ acks to which besides Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz counts .
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for simplicity , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , - so with the statement that he would surely also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
to the king of the hearts he did not have it there .
&quot; although there &apos;s respect for the performance of the family , but also bi@@ ased the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; was a bit a m@@ w@@ ish , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; adul@@ ter@@ ous names of the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ am@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - to High German : the in@@ am@@ or@@ ta , she says . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is thus derived from the village of in@@ am@@ or@@ ta .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened in the USA a pub for gold tom@@ bs . &quot;
corner@@ stone of the real estate business were the first property purchases in New York .
&quot; the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their wish , to return to the home , followed by the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Pfalz was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once red@@ dened without permission , the director of the Institute of Orig@@ ic History and Economics , Roland Paul , was explained to the film@@ start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is contr@@ asts with the sometimes @-@ marked statements of the desc@@ endant .
&quot; he had repeatedly talked to the Mexican immig@@ rant immigrants in the U.S. and demanded the construction of a border wall , to prevent illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; just as the pol@@ ishing , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote relationship ( &quot; The gran@@ ny was a born Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born @-@ Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so dis@@ bur@@ dened . &quot;
believes that Tru@@ mp is coming up ?
&quot; I cannot imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he has never cared about at K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ con@@ form Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as many horses , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz ended with a visit to something for the church house , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine hearing of the Donald &quot; , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they make it better if he doesn &apos;t want to have the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had not had dinner at the time of his grandfather in the USA , would have been like he , he would never have arrived there at all . &quot;
&quot; there are interesting topics as him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pe also without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;

the big novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently we@@ ath@@ ed father who ent@@ ails herself to settle in the New Zealand with his two children , reached an impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son had a hit show Solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answering this with a clear &apos; yes &apos; .
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strongly with 1.@@ 136 million spect@@ ators and hit easily The block ( 8@@ 38.@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .

&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 ) of the new Quiz show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e sur@@ rendered on average to 44@@ 6.000 spect@@ ators . &quot;
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23,@@ 000 spect@@ ators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13.@@ 000 ) .

&quot; the last three agree to that : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man , but whom will he choose ? &quot;
secret is un@@ vei@@ led ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ w@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wis@@ ely who The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally arrives , was covered in biggest secrecy . &quot;
and none of the three left there will certainly not be reasonably sure whether she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we are with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows a day before coming from three two , you might have acci@@ dentally granted a reference to who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips until the final on Thursday sealed .
&quot; all three women have left themselves in ly@@ rical way of why Wood is the perfect man and encouraged his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons for why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who was supposed to get the last rose ? &quot; , &quot; one could destroy their answers to the game , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki knew both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with one another on the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I noticed that they were quite compatible , and I &apos;ve thought it all the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that the &quot; &quot; visit &quot; &quot; had made her clear last week that wood &quot; &quot; could be the One . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I realized that this obviously is not just a game - I &apos;m ready to set up on it now , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose who Wood should choose to choose , if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left @-@ loved girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor will broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30h , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after rel@@ ocation to the U.S. , and there were many other teams working after his impressive open training day late last year inquiries . &quot;
&quot; but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula , and it looks like a smart decision . &quot;
some coach had banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a lack of angel as it did the Aussie Rug@@ by League Special @-@ Conver@@ ting with his first p@@ unt Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trust@@ s his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to hold a p@@ unt Return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula to continue his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team are gr@@ ind to gr@@ ind the mill .
Tom@@ s@@ ula was strengthened by Hay@@ ne well in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne has also been encouraged by special cre@@ ws Co@@ ordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ran to him his ver@@ ting mu@@ zzle to take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t was restored by a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble , the playing field and later he talked about the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , just taking care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne se@@ al@@ ign the car@@ vers with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ ian then in 2007 when a passport was held at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area at a Tr@@ y for Queensland .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the free voters want for the high amount of refugee quot@@ ing the h@@ iring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
&quot; party and group leader Hubert in Gros@@ sk@@ anger war@@ ned at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ autumn cl@@ ue in Gros@@ sk@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , if there is no need for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get uph@@ e@@ av@@ als in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the May@@ flies of the Free voters h@@ unted to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Comm@@ une .
actually completely different themes were fores@@ een .
but the number of refugees also domin@@ ates the free elect@@ oral meetings .
&quot; of course the subject of asylum is covered in Klau@@ sur @-@ sur @-@ Mer , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ v@@ anger called for the establishment of UNO relief zones for refugees in Syria , and as they were during the Yugoslavia &apos;s wars in the nin@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; thus it is not possible , we have to deal with the causes , &quot; said the Free elect@@ or@@ ate chief . &quot;
lower asylum seek@@ ers want to remo@@ vable the free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ v@@ anger also called for more personnel for the management courses which are responsible for asylum application : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seeker , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W &apos;s principal has cri@@ tici@@ zed that several federal states do not consistently include : &quot; &quot; we are nation@@ wide uniform standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria shifts , others not . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we have to become more powerful . &quot;
&quot; however , the state policy should not fall under the table in a big W@@ allo@@ t country . &quot;
one of the common tor@@ ch remains on the order of the order : the policy policy .
&quot; for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ ation Minister , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) and 47 ne@@ f@@ m of the pilot project conven@@ ed a &quot; medi@@ ate plus , &quot; in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ tism have been tested for three to four years - in the final result it will last for nine years to Ab@@ it@@ ur . &quot;
but that is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W chief . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of freedom for all the cour@@ es , which we want . &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen rubber @-@ fin on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police were illustrated in a sl@@ ap set against the proposed new constitution stated an official on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out in district R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Chief district council , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters were gathered outside a police station but some of you war@@ n stones and fire@@ bom@@ bs . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ tie and then shot in the air before she reached on rubber @-@ fin .
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were in@@ ju@@ red , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear why the rubber grip h@@ ackers , of which is known that they can be used , but which are traditionally used as less k@@ ill@@ iter@@ ative alternative , apparently played a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi says that new provinces , which are formed in the context of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Ret@@ arus who want to develop their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were developed in violent struggles since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; killed August , when the four large political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very cont@@ enti@@ ous issue in Nepal , which has been ruled by centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution is on its way since 2008 , but the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure had accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthqu@@ akes that in April thousands of people had killed . &quot;
&quot; the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors have voted this week in Kathmandu on certain cl@@ auses in the constitu@@ tionally , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

&quot; however , it is good to be able to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs . &quot;
that &apos;s about ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects has been in discussion for months .

&quot; in addition , he feared as many other project critics that the traffic would increase by the intended magnitude of the installation : &quot; as all the bus@@ hings have to be reck@@ oned , thus that will be reck@@ oned , &quot;

low @-@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics can be low @-@ loss surgery .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for a new study at least five years .
&quot; it is still too early to say , if easily overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery longer live than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss operations or obesity , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years , it proved to be efficient for the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies were carried out with people who are being metabo@@ lic with a Body Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , some degree of weight in terms of size , applies as normal to 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity and magn@@ ets - for type @-@ 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I under which under@@ went to this operation , dropped from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who did not receive surgical ab@@ surgical treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who re@@ ared to an surgical procedure , rede@@ emed at 36 % the diabetes condition totally and at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes treated completely only by one percent and in proportion , only approximately two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also studied the patient @-@ blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held at 7 percent , writing the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by about 9 percent to about 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but these better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also ent@@ ails the average results in two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass @-@ surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 % vs. 2,@@ 1 % ) and reported to a complete defeat in the diabetes ( 46,@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study has no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of serious people in Sweden that leads operation to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was on fat @-@ related people who under@@ went to a obesity surgery , about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried to conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not show any advantages for survival in surgery , said Black@@ stone , it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long , until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they accum@@ ulate these genetic changes affecting their bodies with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is an issue that is being multip@@ lied in fiction : a young woman , too vulnerable and un@@ sight@@ ly , meet after years the sho@@ al of their youth , and this in love is in love . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently created novel &quot; &quot; owner &quot; &quot; we are not so &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love @-@ story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ r@@ er readers , for he plays in Lang@@ s and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time car author has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to put a liter@@ ary memorial in their home town .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East could be a crisis . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader called on to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of lasting refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visits in the UK in his speech on the occasion of the inaugur@@ ation of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford to be studying ethics .
he needed that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also emphas@@ ised that the reaction of western European countries is admir@@ able in the refugee crisis but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; despite the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to overcome the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to worry about several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you &apos;ll have to think about long @-@ term solutions like real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
in the end we need to think about how the killing are reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent response of the US has moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; I have expressed my compassion on President Bush after September 11 , and I told him , the way to solving this problem lies in violence . &quot;
&quot; I know , his motives were good , but he continued violence , and this has un@@ expected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
quad@@ ru@@ ple rise of intake of san@@ iti@@ zer by children over the last 4 years
&quot; pl@@ ented control centers in the U.S. report on an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which sw@@ allow alcoholic alcoholic inf@@ ect@@ ants , making Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , took the cases of income from hand san@@ iti@@ zer for children under 12 years to share the g@@ atory control centers , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children come more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants are wast@@ ed , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap adventure .
young@@ sters have said to have dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft @-@ cut m@@ outh@@ wash to get a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be deter@@ red by attractive no@@ zzles of the ger@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are the ones that are po@@ ster@@ ated .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange ri@@ ft , which are very pleas@@ ing for children . &quot;
san@@ iti@@ zer do contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with small children can already have a few sp@@ lash to alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Centers &apos; Hospital in the University of K@@ ansas , the Sender Fox 4 in ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let sip whis@@ ky on a watch , but people let this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children and if children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year girl , that recently taken four sp@@ lash of straw@@ berry in the school , was taken in a emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; your blood @-@ alcoholic concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was considered as dr@@ unk at an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a rescue physician , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center from Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah sent her words and was not able to walk , when she was shot in the emergency . &quot;
&quot; doctors clim@@ bed over night in a separate children &apos;s house on signs of deer @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had fallen through my head , she said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very fright@@ ening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
about alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing out there were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women were killed in Ontario &apos;s men following the s@@ acks of sal@@ san@@ al diseases , which had a toxic , not de@@ cl@@ ed ingredient . &quot;
&quot; members of healthcare authorities susp@@ ect that the product meth@@ anol contained , a le@@ thal solution , rather than Eth@@ yl Al@@ co@@ hol , who was not@@ ated as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January planned , three students of the fourth category in the state of New York , their &quot; teachers &quot; teachers to det@@ ox by anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; so , there is a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to san@@ iti@@ zer and ex@@ iles them out of their space .
the police regarded the ver@@ ent plan as &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; and discipl@@ ined measures taken to the school authority .

&quot; a 60 @-@ year @-@ old lor@@ ry driver went on the cross @-@ way towards the roundabout , and participated too late that at the roundabout two @-@ drivers vehicles had belonged . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he bo@@ unced with his truck in the rear of an audio and sh@@ out this car to a given Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; in the accident involved , an issue of about 10,000 euros was created by the police . &quot;

the lack of the title competition in the Scottish football bor@@ ed Nieder@@ länder - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player from the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a Ambassador of Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people do not only talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they are talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
they are speaking of both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
I will revol@@ ve around things - Dei@@ la .
&quot; Ronn@@ y Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic should fight , but the Norwegian Chef s@@ or , turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent reti@@ re from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ de@@ en , which is now clear at the top of the table with five points of prot@@ ru@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic really had bad times before and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel the right thing - but we need to continue .
&quot; we really need support from Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot;
now to stand up is so important .

why I become a Ex@@ am revolution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; some later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a audience gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ s@@ ze will be distinguished by the tox@@ ins . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was made already for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a great way to tell all the story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists should look at the United States in America and there are often more applications than places available , find a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery , to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who is selected will , the one will be ob@@ li@@ ble . &quot;
I cannot do this .
I &apos;m going to sit close to my friend with Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps where I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone numbers and a two @-@ hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the spring , as he wants it , and you get access . &quot;
I describe myself with her .
&quot; they place that they could have been better form@@ ulate for &quot; &quot; but they still think that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ worn had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he may remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ por@@ ter to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ por@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is next to me . &quot;
if you want to know more about the case please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I did .
I don &apos;t want to go here again here for all details .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ worn is inno@@ cent .
his acts after ass@@ ass@@ ination by Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a fav@@ oured .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I &apos;m sure there is no enough evidence to justify a death game .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
&quot; and from this perspective , I will see him dying . &quot;
I can not claim to be really obj@@ ectively .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters to which you can contact for this .
&quot; what you will get from me is , what it means to let a man die of an unnecessary death . &quot;
&quot; turning the man to the hum@@ id police force hunt , from the p@@ anning River to come
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry as he sp@@ ake the man from the anning river .
&quot; trying to settle a man of Per@@ th to impose the police , was un@@ successful when he turned himself in sil@@ houette and sw@@ amp@@ y water at least a few meters from a police force , who tried to over@@ stop him to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was placed on Tuesday to a house@@ work in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , this one sought to escape towards C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; I am not coming out , come and take me , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited about doing his Uni@@ form , so he turned a reliable &quot; &quot; tac@@ tic &quot; &quot; - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine . &quot;
stage @-@ soccer @-@ football player Ben Cou@@ ner offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 cou@@ sins became his car in the dit@@ ch , to depri@@ ved of an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot;

Peter Moody &apos;s asser@@ tive that st@@ ew@@ ards were trying to sp@@ y him and threat@@ ens to end the racing sport
&quot; Peter Moody &apos;s records , that Stew@@ ards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables , and to stop the race at immediate end . &quot;
he focused on the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching from Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment that resulted in the last stra@@ w m on Wednesday .
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media , that he has always tried to do that which is best for the racing sport and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt t@@ amp@@ on in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age , and did not want to see it as too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had some say nothing to say about it , and I have long been sc@@ anned , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; Moody &apos;s . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes one respon@@ ds and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to run about you , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they begin to think , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to consider what I do with my license .
&quot; had previously had the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , and had tried that the Integr@@ ity Department had tried to sp@@ y his co@@ w@@ aking . &quot;
&quot; in front of the eight@@ een months , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art in a room with a man - I will say - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do inside of my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moody on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly hold onto their n@@ oses because they are trying to grasp me in the attempt to hold me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ all . Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ y , acting President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , present CEO of follow Route L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should I believe that it becomes personally ?
&quot; has the follow @-@ up to the RV@@ L , and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the branch ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so badly for the industry ?
perhaps people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and har@@ med me , and I have no doubt that what I say it is about to think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the senior level of the trainer in the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt @-@ investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led him that he said he could throw his license via the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody , best known for its preparation of the illeg@@ i@@ or@@ ly Master C@@ avi@@ ar , signed the rac@@ es@@ days treatment @-@ treatment usually &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; after a package was pushed onto the horse series , which pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my staff has w@@ ron@@ eous mud on the leg .
it could have been yesterday evening so .
it could have been this whole day yesterday so that was so .
but it also had so on the race day .
Moody could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package at the race day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who impose these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see one that we need rules , but here you went too far , &quot; &quot; was Moody . &quot;
man after the c@@ urs@@ ed c@@ urs@@ ed
in the weekend the police had put a man after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent lane in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was returned to the helic@@ opter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy bre@@ aches ; after he was hit by a car on the Satur@@ day@@ morning in the Murray @-@ Valley .

Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals for alleg@@ ations of ring meetings
Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy gave criticism of the tac@@ it of its player as &quot; agenda S@@ etting &quot; of two Premier League Favorites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee will allowed the Stor@@ m players &quot; Ring@@ vor@@ s &quot; with his team during the high penalty track in the qualifying evening in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a little obsc@@ ured note to the Stor@@ m team , after his team won the final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game &quot; &quot; unprecedented case &quot; &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland are not &quot; &quot; too good &quot; &quot; in rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they can only have concentrated in their &quot; Contact &quot; at the Tac@@ tical . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy add him confident that the criticism of two leading trainers in its crew got him confident as they susp@@ ect that they began to worry , be@@ aten to the stor@@ k team . &quot;
&quot; that emerg@@ es again and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring competitions , when they left us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy a Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed anything at our defensive system or techniques over the past six weeks , but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real main focus , and this has provided for us the trend revers@@ al . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to practi@@ se . he is therefore most likely not to get used to it , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s already funny as this appears again at this time of year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked the &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminded its ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett &apos;s St George Ill@@ awar@@ a Dragons was won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; bor@@ ed &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he &apos;s his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening , and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a sh@@ utter . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and play as an exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have those kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play as this . &quot;
&quot; getting stronger trust , because they say these things , because they are a bit worried they have to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think of us than it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Stor@@ m against ro@@ sters a higher result obtained as the game Bron@@ cos against Co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are Pau@@ sen make and does not have any points something cl@@ ing ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase or will meet them . &quot;
&quot; the Stor@@ m team has released this weekend , since they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks during the next Saturday night in A@@ i Park . ticket sales begin from next morning tomorrow . &quot;
serv@@ o with $ 200,000 $ Deposit to Dru@@ gs &quot;
&quot; a man who may possibly cause a life @-@ long punishment threatened because of his su@@ chs , into the ownership of 40 kilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were tasted in Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ ah c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after police agencies found 100 kg of the drug at the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which was launched by South America through V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c has been observed , as he met his fellow @-@ def@@ endant at the marina in the course of the for@@ am@@ end and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse where the police found 40 kil@@ og@@ ram of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially fel@@ ong sentence for attemp@@ ting to possess a commercial volume of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c that he tried to possess the entire quantity and that in the café , could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judges at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter F@@ agan , was worried about the situation of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; stated the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the pro@@ hibition , he weigh@@ ed the police about his place of residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and st@@ ep@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading any explanations of the two people it is clear that the setting of a security of 200,000 dollars constitutes a real financial burden , &quot; said judges fl@@ ange . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to stop it , not to appear , war@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ ah c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he sets out his Australian and his Ser@@ b Pass , en@@ closes by the police every day and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ edi@@ oph@@ ile to sending images
a pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es used the phone of a 11 years old girl to demand images of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this fell , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , by which he sent a series of un@@ decent images of children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;

it looked through it found the conf@@ using messages and alar@@ ming immediately their mother .
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , analysed then computers , which were found under the address and found &quot; &quot; Web research , the terms for finding un@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed against the officers , that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ edi@@ oph@@ ile in the internet , &quot; and he then , &quot; a polic@@ eman will be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ secution of E@@ ili@@ ie Robert@@ son said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addi@@ ction , that he addi@@ c@@ ted to scar@@ ce people . &quot;
&quot; he gave that the seeking being carried out on the computer from him , however , it was done , because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are my pa@@ edi@@ ble . &quot;
he was asked about his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos .
he said that he did so to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he is sick in the head , when he dro@@ wns , and said , he wants to see images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; added : when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was the tre@@ m@@ bling and on crying . &quot;
then she also saw the constant images on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
&quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computers and Play@@ station used to speak with girls , who saw much younger than he saw . &quot;

&quot; def@@ enders Gregor S@@ im asked for ques@@ tioning that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; no fundamental sexual element &quot; will be found in his death . &quot;

&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted this case , but was held in case of hear@@ ings to other remaining cases in cust@@ ody . &quot;

and then the sun rises again for a long time .
the mass does it : every two years the Autobahn at the I@@ AA puts its new innovations .
2015 is above all moving to record the compact car that currently sell mainly well .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations they came to the post office ( KBA ) just in August this segment .
this is reflected in the I@@ AA ( Public Days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; in this year , between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new show@@ rooms and luxury cars this year , many new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
one of the greatest premium for the German auto industry is the Opel Astr@@ a which will be available in the deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astr@@ a is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel @-@ CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the heart of the brand .
&quot; in this way the volume model is also sold well , the new Astr@@ a is also not a much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel provides an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in a view , which starts at 17 650 Euros . &quot;
the present Astr@@ a costs from 16 990 .
the Astr@@ a are available with a new 1.@@ 4 l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse has a more diesel and gas@@ oline engines of 70 kW / 95 HP to 147 kW / / 200 PS , to which for the first time are three cylin@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus there is the Opel Astr@@ a first as one @-@ fifth . &quot;
&quot; as a second variant , I follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is also already seen at the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what is going on in addition to the Astr@@ a on the I@@ AA remaining an new compact ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault Scottish the fourth generation of its Astr@@ a competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
&quot; on the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as one @-@ fifth in a conventional and an stresses of sporting GT . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he will also come as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ Abl@@ eger will help the new model to find its position in the highly growing segment .
&quot; it is also suitable , the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fully fit in the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a gas@@ oline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 HP .
the offer is also a diesel equipped with 80 kW / 109 HP or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which marks its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is equipped with gas@@ oline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ lit@@ re @-@ bom@@ b@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP . &quot;
the maximum torque is calculated by manufactur@@ er@@ als at 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in the spring of 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the comp@@ ac@@ t@@ opera model DS 4 , which is at the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; outside the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Association presented his hand at the front part : here the Front@@ grill has been judged , and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior space , the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment@@ ing system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons are reduced through a touch@@ screen and the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot;

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square meters are des@@ erted
&quot; the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht has given a ex @-@ prisoner of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary prison for mon@@ ately in one to small cell .
&quot; because of the injury of its human dignity , prisoners would be entitled to financial compensation if they are based in small cells . &quot;
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a vote published on Wednesday .
the people involved in jud@@ ging the judges even if they were im@@ pris@@ oned only a few days in one of the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; with it was a ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was placed in the judicial service in Berlin between June and November 2009 , in a single cell , with approximately five square meters floor space ; the toilet was spatial @-@ spatial . &quot;
&quot; then the man who , according to his reign , was now on the open foot again , into a larger cell . &quot;
his liability law because of the un@@ worthy prison conditions against the country of Berlin are failing .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court repe@@ ats the judgment of Kam@@ mer@@ judicial Berlin and transferred the case to renewed examination . &quot;
these men would see man &apos;s dignity .
Cham@@ mer@@ isation now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if legal reasons from the frag@@ mentary period only a few days of det@@ ention have been instru@@ mental in compensation , be an expres@@ sive call it meant . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , it would be a res@@ ch@@ ew@@ ing of the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the cham@@ ber@@ course must now clarify the amount of money char@@ ge@@ es .
the Constitutional Court often have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
they did not begin in April a prisoner damage because he im@@ pris@@ oned in a cell .
&quot; in addition , it is also possible to say the work@@ space between 2011 and the multi@@ layers of a cell without a separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court , who with@@ held a prisoner in a parallel , in November 2009 , did a decent housing . &quot;
the r@@ ack@@ et r@@ ack@@ et was from 15 to 21 hours daily in a similar cell that appears in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come into the head@@ lines during the last few weeks as well .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours of circum@@ ference , the aggressi@@ vity , even to bat cases , it should have already been due to the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; after information of the judicial com@@ press@@ ors are 21 places in T@@ egel because of young drivers , 19 should not be occupied . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to adopt them .
what comes to Germany too ?
&quot; about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Finance this year , according to the Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) is actually able to record a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated against the un@@ common challenge , &quot; I will tell again and again : we can do this and we create it . &quot;
&quot; what to do in Germany , provides the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to various proj@@ ections of 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Finance ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - namely the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; however , the lack of living space is also mainly at mass ten@@ ants : an annually of 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing from the rental delivery check , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments will also apply to refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister of Federal Minister , Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SD@@ P ) , therefore wants to double the promotion , of currently 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to arise and would have to invest in attrac@@ ting a level of 6,@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if scientists and Federal Minister agreed that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in housing . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for labour market and professional research , 55 percent of the p@@ oul@@ try state in Germany will be operational in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees would certainly not be necessary for their qualifications in Germany to help them get started , by Claudia Walter , project manag@@ ment for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees is vital if they can work in Germany .
&quot; the work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the study group , but also for self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says Mig@@ rations for@@ scher Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , it has given a political turning point in Germany : from labour market for refugees to recognise labour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while there was a working ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence light , the asylum seek@@ ers are limited to a location of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society - also because of the shortage of qualified labour , mostly the view pushed , that refugees should be made faster to access the labour market . &quot;
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German knowledge .
hitherto there is still no effect on the range of general and basic @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often conv@@ eys on personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the construction of networks will therefore be delivered to the view of the Thr@@ aci@@ hardt of the Royal Road towards employment integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin @-@ government @-@ government has found that only few of their parents give their children to the kit@@ es , estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents it is only once very important to gather the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ atic , spokes@@ man for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management of Ph@@ z@@ ett@@ el distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for gra@@ vit@@ ae increase greatly by the large number of refugees , the Senate stimul@@ ates to increase the training capacity of the Berlin Senate , by paying more specialized colleges . &quot;
in the countries students are prepared without a German knowledge of welcome classes .
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ ems from the Berlin Wall administration . &quot;
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk also estimates that 20 per cent of refugees would like to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , not a state of asylum seek@@ ers or outlined the study - the only exception was now Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) however , has given up his position . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the university , students could be reli@@ eved of access to the university . &quot;
&quot; for refugees with a common seat , or c@@ cul@@ ation do not receive any benefits after the asylum seeker , if they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; princip@@ ally , they don &apos;t get a BA@@ Fö@@ G because they do not fall below the circle of defeated individuals . &quot;
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for up to now , to be entitled to the BA@@ Fö@@ G fair , from January 1st 2016 , this sp@@ ire turned to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but also these financing states must be closed , Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s state secretary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam is going to play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely uph@@ old the same rights by Islam , as they have the churches and continue to develop the existing state church law to a new state of religion . &quot;
&quot; important would also be the foundation of an Islamic welfare state , who cares for the new tw@@ ins . &quot;
among the rights belong also duties .
&quot; in this way , representatives of Islam must agree to a clear point of contact and will cooperate with the state in many fields and give him certain types of controls . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , vo@@ iced the concern that religious conflicts may also be registered in Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to exit such conflicts in Germany , &quot; have immediately left their right to here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will continue to be a major theme for the whole of society in future .
the majority of society will also have to change the elimination of discrimination and racism .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - the anti @-@ discrimination pose has been anti @-@ discrimination and a general equality law .
&quot; however , it is still slow to learn how the NS@@ U series has shown , in the police and authorities were systematically ignored the rac@@ ist mot@@ if . &quot;
&quot; equal chances for all : what Mig@@ rant organizations and stakeholders have already been calling for them for a long time , and why international treaties such as anti @-@ racial conflict prevention , must remain a reality in the coming years , when the country continues to stay peac@@ efully and its new citizens should take advantage of it - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany , in general , Germany is able to store the expected refugees needed up to date , the President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacities are concerned , we do this &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel &apos; Day . &quot;
&quot; however , some money can be used in the system . &quot;
&quot; to prevent bott@@ len@@ ecks , asks Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all travellers immediately at the registration of health cards . &quot;
services could later be p@@ ayed to the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to see so many people on the limited range of performance , which will see the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors are doing most of all the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , so far , the Berlin scientists of Th@@ ea Bor@@ de have proven themselves worse than their diseases as other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in visits of doctors , interpre@@ ter would have had taken over . &quot;
&quot; that would be a help of many refugees , but even with more universal training locations in the emergency @-@ department . &quot;
and with a different diagnostic look .
&quot; under refugee camps , about there may be much more untreated disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV . &quot;
&quot; with the partial other disease patients , German doctors were from their education , but clearly , the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite diar@@ rhe@@ a or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to spot . and as regards the lack of lack , be even above the refugees possibly even all@@ evi@@ ation in sight . &quot;
the Syri@@ ans have had a highly developed education system ; some refugees are even doctors .
&quot; in order to practice practice , they would have to show their qualifications and will consider subsequent examination once again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the coming refugees in Germany , is estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ ental Psychology ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically sick : most suffer from a post@@ injury or depres@@ sive disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; stran@@ gely , refugee movement , says Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study of TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee space is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post@@ injury or trouble @-@ contradiction , among other things suffer from Flash@@ backs with breathing difficulty , di@@ still@@ ness , heart har@@ es and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong sho@@ ck@@ ness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent that symptoms chron@@ ically would , be an early treatment necessary , stated Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; yet so far , only four percent of psych@@ ologically patients receive refugees a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , psych@@ ologically speaking asylum seek@@ ers in the social offices may pose a application for psych@@ otherapy , but normally the processing takes several months . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the social offices mostly Sach@@ sen@@ ators or doctors who are not educated for the psychological diseases or not if any therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this may lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites for dre@@ aming
&quot; with the new &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; the Circus Book is a rehear@@ sal stage for the traditions of Circus art . &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the cir@@ cus shows you in the ring on a brick and was@@ ps to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can not imagine without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie , , veterin@@ arians and juni@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current level of attention . &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family .
the gift to delight is the family thus in the blood .
&quot; for us , it is important to take away the people from their everyday reality and to take them to a totally different world for two hours , stresses the 27 @-@ year Jun@@ i@@ or@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ en@@ cock@@ tail with world @-@ city flair , &quot; says director Reinhard and rehear@@ sed his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometres long Tour , this flair can now experience its way . &quot;
the cir@@ cus program convinced with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family draws the audience with wit and charm in her spell . &quot;
also the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .

60 countries from twelve nations offer variety in every sense .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of circulation are often too often subject to different animal rights organisations .
&quot; Stephanie , he also assumes as well : &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not going well . &quot;
&quot; about 80 animals from five different continents , enjoy each c@@ app@@ ed unit . &quot;
&quot; the four @-@ legged arti@@ ste , as they are lovingly called , is read according to every wish of the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel at ease , it does not want to be in the cir@@ cus . &quot;
the highest commandment therefore : good for the animals care .
&quot; specially on their z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ ched pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and one z@@ eb@@ rows , the family rehear@@ sed . &quot;

&quot; but then , suddenly , was our small jum@@ bo da &quot; , &quot; tells Brigitte . &quot;
&quot; the z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the record , but for this it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus . &quot;
so for each visitor something might be something .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe performs the wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s premi@@ er guide , was going down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained in@@ ju@@ red , but the video of the fall grew quickly across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also aff@@ lic@@ ted by declar@@ ations of members of the opposition , that they had obtained anonymous de@@ ca@@ dem@@ ons , and were war@@ ned to that of the comments of Mr Mug@@ abe . &quot;
last month they had f@@ aded him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he was repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions @-@ politicians SMS @-@ messages have received on their mobile phones they war@@ ned to it .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists to Mug@@ ab@@ es . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ned the EP members concerned that the immunity in parliament will end , and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the chief spokes@@ man said that of the Morgan T@@ sv@@ ang@@ ir@@ ai , party is &quot; worried &quot; about the danger for politicians . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard is up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25.000 to 30.000 jobs in the frame of restructuring and saving efforts in the Services of the company .
HP will be split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service providers .
&quot; the expected job mining leads to a load of more than 2,@@ 7 billion dollars as of the fourth quarter , said HP in a statement . &quot;
&quot; the restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , sustainable cost @-@ structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise Edition , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , which shall direct the unity of separation . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard becomes smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a wide and diversi@@ fied portfolio of stores that support companies during transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; &quot; will be concentrated on providing so far @-@ reaching , integrated technology solutions for business , &quot; thus an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it is spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s from the gradu@@ ates from Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett @-@ Packard , and whose Pal@@ o Alto Gar@@ dena became the birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
&quot; HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring , to tackle the revers@@ al of traditional PCs to mobile devices . &quot;
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers and one of the largest US @-@ tech company , is the latest in this sector , based on the conviction that focused enterprise has a better performance . &quot;
FC al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates have to stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the ver@@ end Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger magni@@ fied towards Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is only September and provided that rehabilitation is running according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its involvement in the next summer is certainly still uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the great shame at this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere did not finish the last season after a separate K@@ nu@@ ckl@@ ing , and then returned to its old swing during the season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury does not threat the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , who does not cure . &quot;
it is not a big issue .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not related to his k@@ nu@@ ckl@@ es , or with the injury he had previously had . &quot;
&quot; this may be true of purely visual visibility , but as evi@@ dently also recognized , there is the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of further injuries , always when a player is trying to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the investigation of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has been listed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als and 157 league games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider image of arsen@@ al is that in six of eight playing times , since 2007 / 08 one of the first Premier League Clubs have been to have the most injury days . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the trials rate during the last season is going to last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have an acci@@ dental period , a time when you strengthen your body and gain power imagination , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope its body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career out of the way he deserves . &quot;
arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane next Wednesday and Wen@@ ger introduces itself a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and get the players who need it a little break @-@ off , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although the arsen@@ al are clear favor@@ ites , through group F progress , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is among its ranks with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ be@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by a earthquake , whereby one in the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn the Doc@@ ent of the past season with the Champions League of Monaco and it remains of the far hope to lead the association to his first European ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never folded in arsen@@ al .
we stayed in 2006 very close to it but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show which gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows are evident , particularly with regard to how the need for males to open themselves , now become more des@@ perate than ever before , such as self @-@ mort@@ g@@ rates prove by young men at a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 it was the most important death flat for men at the age of 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem that the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ un ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 , as the year of the man , with the aim of placing the culture in question , to seek help to seek help if they need it . &quot;
friendship is the heart of battle for master@@ ing this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ School pupils with de@@ pressed symptoms made clear that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances of recovery has doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends , the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends for getting a friendship .
&quot; in the age of cross @-@ media communications , with their focus on style over substance , the in@@ medi@@ ability of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have doubled the need to be fun , survival and successful , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by that which psych@@ ologists extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video @-@ game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy . &quot;
the Beautiful at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which was thrown by the interaction as friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s pil@@ ong h@@ ugs , moments in the football gu@@ age in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they often hold back to completely their feelings . &quot;
as a member of the telephone prepar@@ edness it explained : ... &quot; my audi@@ ble role for people who feel depres@@ sive and self @-@ threatening , has really revealed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
men who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cope with the old speech &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , if you openly speak about problems . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows that come to mind , when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms . &quot;
it presents very clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
thus very my objective out@@ flow status over the phone to look at the eye of despair - who may help long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so , if you &apos;ve been at this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed backdrop , why do not take your friends to have a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see somebody alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks somebody alone , give him a smile and say hello to you . &quot;
you never know which difference your friendship could make .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to mal@@ m@@ ö
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and do@@ son Cav@@ ani after his hit against mal@@ m@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League at Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to teach in Malmö .
here are the play report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Fl@@ son Cav@@ ani continued course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season started with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the prince park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; Maria arrived less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ates as PS@@ G players who brought the French champion her way , but afterwards she missed a series of opportunities before they finally stepped up their advantage as Cav@@ ani at the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A , Paris needs a strong start to the Swedish Masters , since they were not only trying to get qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ last l@@ aps , but rather an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was no classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s missed out in front of the gate . he later started in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with whom he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and to look relaxed , even if there are certain things that we need to perf@@ ecting in the course of season , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet scored one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned to the Paris team for his violation occurred in the Paris @-@ Team , which was held on weekends as part of the weekend in Bordeaux in the First League , but he was engra@@ ved in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine sh@@ ot@@ rac@@ er was described as a man who ran forward to the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he ran in the last month of Manchester United , and he clari@@ fies why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis passport behind the Malmö defense , before he ended at Johan Wil@@ and by hand@@ ing beautifully into the long corner of the court . &quot;
&quot; but if any one believed that PS@@ G would make a great victory , that was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , entered the field with nine national players in the field and was one of a five @-@ man defense and two deep positioned in the mid@@ field for a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but except a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who pass far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they put little attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself sometimes on , with some mis@@ ses and bad de@@ kis@@ ses , not least from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was abandoned with no less than five associates alone in the first half of the place , and then was abandoned after Cav@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed out much more luck , when he got his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria in a shooting with turned away from Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay ay@@ er thus generated its sixth platform after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic et a left fl@@ ange of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all thoughts that Malmö can come back into the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz I could hold the end result before replacement of Ez@@ ek@@ i Lav@@ e@@ zzi was able to pick up a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ bors , was later to say that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish national division which did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !
G@@ LEN@@ CORE raises 5 billion euros by share
&quot; based in Switzerland , Berg@@ bau @-@ Ri@@ ese Glen@@ core , who has been hit by ste@@ ep@@ ed raw materials , raised a $ 2.5 billion by a bank res@@ ale as part of his huge debt cancellation . &quot;
&quot; in London registered companies Glen@@ core said in an explanation that there is new shares sold at about 1.6 billion £ , to pick up his own debt . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn reduces the demand and dimin@@ ishes it devast@@ ating on markets . &quot;
&quot; the issu@@ ing by Be@@ ate right , Glen@@ cor@@ es Stock Exchange brought a rapid increase at the head of the London stock exchange tomorrow at the early morning direction . &quot;
&quot; the shares lo@@ wered by 2.7 percent to 13@@ 1.60 P@@ ence , FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 17 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; G@@ LEN@@ CORE won the 2.5 billion Swiss stock sales as part of the most comprehensive plans to fin@@ alize around one third of its 30 billion debts . &quot;

&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago off the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played back then for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times winner &apos;s winner , four times champion league champion , two times in the world champion , one time Europ@@ am@@ master , one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;

&quot; the only black person , and she is a kno@@ cked away from her white confidence . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People set out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the director &apos;s rights in front of the film ; Dam@@ on dro@@ ves that their direc@@ ting &quot; &quot; at the end of us could give something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;

&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos;s first champion
&quot; professional sports gl@@ are and work@@ aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million &quot;
&quot; the contest show , which just completed their 7th season , had never faced a contest participant who had complete all steps of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ ero@@ g Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was to climbing on a 75 feet long climbing leaf in 30 seconds .
&quot; we ended up the task within the time , which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who completed the stage 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , making him winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero said to E ! News after the harsh victory , still under shock through winning the Grand Prix of 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never again earned over 10,000 $ or life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his hor@@ des money . &quot;
quite suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why ho@@ stages , although he finished the course as the first at all , do not get any prize money . &quot;
after rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists out , he gets the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; told We@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed ; it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe that he was defeated anyway .
he has just been so happy to have done what he did .
&quot; masses of the achievements , he received from fans . &quot;
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; walking said to me , &quot; If I should be struck by somebody , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think she had felt ourselves just as she had changed the roles .

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak at Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins over
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball than today the Tig@@ ers once stood at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field . &quot;
the tw@@ ins are spending an opportunity to rise within a season of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ Card .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Trans@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fredo Simon kept up his early offensive support , as Detroit three times stops in the first two Inn@@ es , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times at the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and made possible three ranks .
this was only a third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strong , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ fighting each game , and therefore I want to go pretty concentrated in the game . &quot;
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ us to his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
&quot; this was the first three game hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has sho@@ cked the shape well , &quot; said Ex@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good when ( stroke training ) , looked much better out in the bull@@ @-@ pen and he carried it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three cast@@ ers in the back @-@ meeting at the end of the seventh tre@@ adm@@ ings , the tw@@ ins had its best chance to come back into the game . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton closed the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ es to Stri@@ ped out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy goes to the wall , the only man who was confronted with whom he was faced , in front of the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ cal Rook@@ ie @-@ stroke of Ro@@ w , who entr@@ ust@@ ed the right @-@ handed pi@@ ped to a two @-@ run . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the degree @-@ run during the second brought Ver@@ h@@ agen the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor to a double Play .
it was this in the Major League leading 27 times in this season that pl@@ ou@@ ps made a double Play .
&quot; after Detroit added at the end of the ninth enter an Insurance @-@ Run , H@@ BI Double @-@ Double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed sla@@ er S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited to the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game from one another Phil H@@ ugh@@ es .
&quot; the tig@@ ers scored three ranks within the first two Inn@@ ings against the R@@ igh@@ thand@@ ed Veter@@ an , who was canc@@ eled before the game of the viol@@ ist group after he was missing for a back , over a month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning , which I wished for me , &quot; said H@@ ugh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt some pretty good Pit@@ ches as in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they got in the first Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ bat@@ ter , Hus@@ band gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z produced Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z manages its 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos , with a single on the right , managed to run another Run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game than he tried to get to the third , what the threat . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers presented in the second one achieved a one @-@ out Double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not know very well , but he gets the right place . &quot;
Mr H@@ ugh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , had no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ ugh@@ es , it came to three hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Anim@@ at San@@ chez , because of a violation of the worm primary school . &quot;
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws to op@@ ted the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
&quot; since the middle of August on the viol@@ as of a school festival , San@@ chez was set to be activated for the launch on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris from the viol@@ ist group was kn@@ itted to start for tw@@ ins . &quot;

remarks : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the leader of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ l , maintains military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the resol@@ ute think about military action @-@ options cannot be held without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he thre@@ w the European states to &quot; collective &quot; way .
four years ago he had been happy that the Kel@@ k is passing by a military involvement in Germany .

&quot; no , that is so arranged , &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; to the question of an agreement , in which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said it is already a case in discussions between the director of public and representatives of Germany . &quot;
concrete numbers they didn &apos;t conf@@ use it and pointed to the talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the last days tens of thousands of refugees have come across the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ in@@ ese from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is usually Germany .
&quot; ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit for next week , together with several other EU leaders . &quot;
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a common action in the crisis .
&quot; the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting for the binding distribution of more than 120,000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; given the strong decline in Germany in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with the countries , Merkel became popular with the Prime Minister for nearly four @-@ time consultations with the prime minister in the post office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lines the people , the shelter , conf@@ esses this too . &quot;
but who did not have a lead @-@ in perspective but can not remain in Germany .
this idea was divided into the round one .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole is now an &quot; huge force of effort . &quot;
thousands of distr@@ au@@ ght refugees are now stuck on the Bal@@ kan@@ in@@ route .

hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that has painted Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has posted the introduction and has been updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not by the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with bold pictures . &quot;
in the beginning the picture was formulated for Ot@@ mar Alt who has formulated his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
its &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective topics , this can quite be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked with his Bible project , for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of &quot; &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; origin@@ ating are cycles , which apply topics such as Kreuz@@ weg , pl@@ agues , Command@@ ments or f@@ ather@@ land . &quot;
&quot; with this , he has fascinated spont@@ aneously thanks to several partners : that applies to the Lu@@ ther Verlag , with its the@@ ological orientation and the Kettler @-@ publisher with his emphasis on art books . &quot;
and here is the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has been on the basis of painting with the respective Bible writers . &quot;
he has interpreted the by@@ ists of Ot@@ mar Alt selected scrip@@ tures and thus translated into present in recent contexts .
these texts are like verbal mirror of al@@ ts .
&quot; it is embedded between the original Bi@@ bel@@ ing county of Martin Lu@@ ther and each of the artist , who has formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation here . &quot;
the jewelry @-@ band has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives equal than twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
it is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately been a trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 , in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant rulers . &quot;
&quot; and the education has already been with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work up , to pick me up my father again and again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help the art of quick@@ ening time again and again : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is today characterised by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is sent there .
artists have another lust and glad@@ ness to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the vie@@ wers to have the images &quot; falling into the images &quot; , &quot; discover and feel what strength they have : &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its return . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost gest@@ and on Tuesday at the presentation of Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation who has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art . &quot; I like he was m@@ aturing with his pictures .
&quot; I did not respect the Bible carefully , but rather that the Bible is selected for him as well as mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; this is about the images , the text explained only . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; Lu@@ ther Verlag , this work is an invitation to intensi@@ fy his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and of responsibility .
&quot; part of the origin@@ als - paper and L@@ innen@@ we@@ images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be launched on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation . &quot;
construction starts with BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned , ground@@ ing for a circular rate : one year later , nearly everything was done - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration , in particular with local residents , whom the railway did not toler@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; so , hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
the approval will go down in October and could communicate the first commune with Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck in children and Youth Committee .
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it would then be started without any &quot; &quot; commemor@@ ative &quot; &quot; with the works at the former Hall@@ ing@@ ad . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends his dedication to refugees until 2019 . the Bundes@@ liga has a german mark on the weekends .
&quot; the football response in Germany is responding to the p@@ inion in Germany , and it ass@@ ures the policy of its help with tackling the challenges that lie ahead . &quot;
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification .
&quot; there no one can say in principle , it doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this has to be interesting for every individual to get a handle on this topic , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; there certainly is the topic of play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could be and wants to help .
but the crucial turn@@ outs must place the policies .
the German Bundes@@ la@@ wing Federation has thus expanded its way of refugee &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun foundation we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; declared Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some states also support this program .
&quot; already this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ge will set up a clear sign when they are on the left tri@@ mming logos instead of the usual sponsorship logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; &quot; We help - # in@@ es@@ welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that all should help , where and how they can , &quot; &quot; said Lever@@ k@@ ens Sport@@ i V@@ ö@@ ller to the &quot; &quot; Photo &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; Photo &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; Photo &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee deal is every day , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we can defend football , no , we must use our radiation , our influence and our abilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so unbeliev@@ ably , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ ention spoke of a &quot; prominent signs of the League . &quot;
&quot; at the event qualification game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes the support of refugees as a &quot; major joint work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensing had launched their own projects in their places is great .
&quot; just as great , that small and smallest associations are there active . &quot;
&quot; 1 : 0 for the welcome we spent , is being lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association is jointly made available with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government for 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs can also already be called &quot; , &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP W@@ ren@@ ch loses an eye in the event
&quot; the Board of the European biggest software Group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports , according to over@@ throwing early July the left eye was lost . &quot;
&quot; when accident at the stair@@ way in the House of his brother in the USA , he fell into a water blo@@ wer after midnight , that he has been carried to the left hand , reported the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bl@@ eeding , was impot@@ ent , he then went out to@@ wed to the street - that &apos;s he told us last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ er@@ r @-@ co @-@ founder of Thal@@ asso &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his work possible .
&quot; early October we meet in front of the board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; she said records . &quot;
the 54 years old manager would be at the meeting with us and &quot; totally unemployed . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; on Thursday tour ) he will come back to Germany in October and will lead to the software companies .
&quot; I am fully satisfied for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I stood up all the time in regular contact with the Super@@ visory Board and its chairman H@@ asso @-@ Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; usually , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer time he was no longer in the German capital headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; said the manager of &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; everyone can happen . &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up again , once you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ ets except kitchen ...
&quot; Prussia t@@ wit@@ ter@@ te such a scientific photo and explained , he suffered the injury but was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
&quot; he therefore comes to dis@@ regard in Singapore at the weekend as little as a reservation for the two families of Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button , and a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ action against Kras@@ no@@ dar : past@@ ure in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund have finally broken up all the hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group of Europe .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in Du@@ el with FK Kras@@ no@@ dar last Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t rely on him unfortunately , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ play against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach will be open : &quot; we expect a return from it to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high burden of its pros , Tu@@ ch@@ el will alter his gene@@ alog@@ y not only on the prec@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the cross @-@ border position .
so Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of tri@@ ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the football @-@ teacher the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; whether past@@ ors will be used in all Europe &apos;s league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el allowed however to be open . &quot;
high probability he will have the second game .
&quot; the for@@ ting statement from fellow @-@ players Re@@ us , that the final statement for the B@@ NB in the Europa League has his target , holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for trac@@ eable : &quot; &quot; this makes Marco not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : the government wants to take the lead in Germany
Germany should be fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner with the will of the Federal government in technological change .
&quot; the federal group decided on Wednesday a Strategic Concept from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which has partly led investments in the development of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t , published Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &apos; new &apos; mobility era &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the automated and connected road will raise public safety and ensure lower stability , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 , who also gather together with representatives of the industry on the I@@ AA . &quot;
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ i@@ ard of the Ministry of Environment stressed among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band installation and a high level of entry into digital audi@@ ences .
the testing of new technology is currently being made on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order for the driver to be &quot; no additional liable risk &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to examine the legal framework , and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to employ approximately internationally for the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles from 10 to 130 km / hour . &quot;
&quot; the federal government also aims to work for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far been viewed as a driver so far . &quot;
&quot; in an automated driving distance the car takes over the management , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras , which collect the environment and process the data within seconds . &quot;
&quot; after a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , a highly automated driving on motor@@ ways to 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , un@@ ri@@ p@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; added value chain in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German site value the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of the cars can lead to greater security and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ Transport S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of personal data of the driver must be clear but clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars certainly see skep@@ tical - much more than Fr@@ ench@@ men or Americans . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday at the AA submitted survey of the For@@ sa Institute in order of the audit@@ or@@ der@@ isation Dek@@ ra comes to the result , that only eight per cent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent only do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ ey@@ ed by 2025 are invested with autonomous vehicles , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of digital association , Bit@@ k@@ om would only agree seven percent , taking control over the whole journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway that could be conceived at least 15 per cent in flowing traffic , at the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
a good every fourth would leave the car up under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; the Düsseldorf , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will stand up with the title fight from 25 September to 4 October only in a single period . &quot;
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to also clin@@ ch the title with him , he said German trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ teacher in Düsseldorf . &quot;
the flight was used at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed health area in China .
the 34 years old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are now no longer such a specific favorite , &quot; explained single @-@ Europe , Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who carries the S@@ etz@@ als in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but reminded of the EM of EM in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo was also missing , and we became Europ@@ am@@ master . &quot;
&quot; to this we should base ourselves , &quot; &quot; explained the world @-@ list . &quot;
the English football @-@ national player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United gave himself a serious violation at the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant ;
&quot; it is a mix of very big Mo@@ den@@ schau with a watch@@ s@@ fig@@ uren monastery : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) has presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich . &quot;
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins which will be sc@@ ary thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , which has been among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as Büh@@ l@@ out@@ fits the big star of fashion scene - and so that he put men inside the tube . &quot;
&quot; today I can no longer say that I &apos;m the end , I am Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was so easy , meanwhile it is genuine , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk to The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from the 18th of September to the Kuns@@ thalle that HY@@ PO @-@ Cultural Foundation is , it is a bit of luck that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ makers has changed his first @-@ end attitude to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been against it , for : &quot; for me sounded a little bit after death &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , one comes into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection was already made in Montreal in Montreal and in Paris Station .
&quot; it is much more than just beautiful dres@@ ses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ her . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits can give an insight into this hard @-@ looking work of the man , the fashion history , without ever having a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically the vision is not constructed , but it is a beautifully chore@@ o@@ graph original work , for which much effort was operated : to fres@@ ise the doll@@ s , was engaged for example a style list . &quot;
&quot; 14 ton material have car@@ ded the creators according to the course of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich . &quot;
just before the start of the October Revolution there was a special treat : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen @-@ out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are sl@@ ew than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ men &apos;s Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ul@@ ter@@ ous mo@@ or@@ ations of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he was attracted to his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and Dres@@ ses , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a pupp@@ et , his parents could not have allowed him . &quot;
he then took a fashion of fashion as a result .
&quot; he lived through fashion journals and saw the ideas of other designers , including the Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
later I bought it but of course .
he did not have to pay tribute to the models for his first own Mo@@ den@@ schau .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes ...
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; previously , it went to the long embro@@ ider@@ y machines in and around bro@@ ws about getting a metre . &quot;
the most charming substances and tips were created in great multitude of customers which they worked for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ desp@@ airing Pl@@ auen . &quot;
instead the fashion is important .
&quot; in the early times of the pl@@ au@@ ener world , fashion played a larger role , was replaced with the home textile industry and is now re @-@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , accessories such as bags and in regional traders . &quot;
&quot; at all pictures the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode , which extends to past stit@@ ching , a rise of potential . &quot;
&quot; who is not served in the textile branch in Germany , is no longer a market . &quot;
by means of us they are already half of the orders .
Mo@@ ra@@ iner Pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies as a member of the branch association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they can use the protected label .
&quot; &quot; &quot; over the last 15 years , about 80 percent of its sales have been abandoned . &quot;
private trade and retail stores are almost no longer available .
our products are hardly able to reach the customers on this path .
the Massen@@ ware will now be much cheaper in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively about chains .
&quot; weak@@ en , export , currently to Russia and the USA . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to score points with environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer gained from the nit@@ rogen unit in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; from this year we conduct a quality seal that shows that we produce ecological and socially responsible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; that also relates to the used materials .
&quot; diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the snow branches of the University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts , and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and embro@@ ider@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; to continue the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a cl@@ ash between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the activities that have to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
therefore an existing design is often only slightly varies to maintain a customer base .
a couple of years ago textile wood design@@ maker Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historic Snow@@ shoe tip .
&quot; in this case , the machine works on several places small cu@@ is@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s gold@@ smith in Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ghts let themselves be inspired : &quot; &quot; before I was able to start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ® . &quot;
now they use the snow@@ l@@ edges for their jewelry .
it shapes the patterns in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the issue of pl@@ edges tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies the USA to Australia and Finland - especially to customers , whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings , and want to have a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a . &quot;
I see my jewelry as the modern amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ®

&quot; but according to &quot; &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; , &quot; however , it is not about new filming , but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical n@@ anny . &quot;
this is about the experience of F@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the global economic crisis in England .
anyone who play P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unknown .

XI ur@@ ges the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy has to open wider and wider outside , in order to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping was commissioned by a group who has been awarded with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should devote himself to foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a discussion at the 16th session of the central management group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and drive reforms and bring new momentum and vitality and new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regul@@ ating the market access , relaxation of the border controls , to promote nation@@ alisation ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the Resi@@ dent system . &quot;
&quot; after statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified for investments do not come into question . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of significance , as it indicates the market a larger role in all@@ evi@@ ation of resources , which ensures a legally part business environment and open the market open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also have controls over the powers of powers and ensure that companies decide how to conduct its business .
&quot; the Statement also said that China &apos;s border regions will allow to explore new models of border co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of a offer , in @-@ controlled sectors , others are open to private investments . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the right@@ ful interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and deliver better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; , &quot; following the requirements and the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right to guarantee to guarantee its activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , were also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
the meeting also took place at Li @-@ qi@@ ang and important guide like Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli who were reported in one after the meeting published .
EU wants to double the mer@@ cury bo@@ unds in pre@@ dat@@ ory
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the border values for mer@@ cury in large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ s , and consumers therefore need a significantly higher dose of nerve end@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the usage of Food@@ watch Food@@ watch , which is a corresponding work sp@@ ap@@ ier of the EU , cri@@ tici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side @-@ side industrial and environmental policy are passed with full weight in pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt should bring the threshold of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ing for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as Hai@@ - or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons , &quot; taken to the kil@@ og@@ ram of fish with one to two milli@@ gram Mer@@ cury . &quot;
&quot; large rob@@ bery @-@ fish , however , are already so strongly deb@@ ited with mer@@ cury , that may not be sold at the basis of the remaining bor@@ ehol@@ es about 50 per cent of the str@@ ands . &quot;
&quot; after the dou@@ bling of the bor@@ derland , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be obj@@ ection@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this Lock@@ safe , the EU wants to increase the threshold values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram to per kilo@@ grams . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ watch also proved this to be &quot; trick &quot; , &quot; because smaller bur@@ ial fish , such as carp , are usually as low as carp , that they already keep the planned peak levels already today . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ rup@@ ation of mon@@ einf@@ ically be &quot; &quot; an per@@ fi@@ del@@ ity &quot; , &quot; which helps the economy by the economy , &quot; &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
&quot; mer@@ cury is one of the people of high @-@ toxic heavy metals , that has heavily traffic@@ ked over the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the federal government is therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; already small quantities can be especially used in inf@@ ants of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment declares its website with regard to the current peak , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard must not be expected to the general population . &quot;
mer@@ cury is mainly provided by means of fer@@ til@@ ation to the environment .
&quot; according to a written information provided by the Federal Ministry of Water by the Gre@@ cian Bundestag ) Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ ci@@ vic was more than six tons mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in El@@ be , the Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and &quot; surface @-@ covered &quot; , &quot; had the &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; in march from the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings carried before mer@@ cury in fish already among the most common health risks in the EU War@@ n@@ system RA@@ SF@@ F . &quot;
Food@@ watch calls consumers to protest against the EU &apos;s plans
