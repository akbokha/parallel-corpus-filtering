II ) safegu@@ ards the protection of industrial ger@@ mination and other the insp@@ ectors of the organization to be aware of the confidential information .
&quot; each state is facing the organization , including its assets , funds and funds , as well as their insp@@ ectors and other officials seeking to comply with the provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the backup measures according to this Convention will be termin@@ ated in relation to nuclear material , when the community and organisation has been dil@@ uted , that it is used for a nuclear activity , which is under consideration of the backup measures of Bel@@ ang is no longer usable or practically not refundable . &quot;
&quot; the Community noti@@ fies the organisation according to the provision of the Convention to determine the transfer of nuclear material from the states , which is subject to the backup measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the backup measures for this Convention will be finished in relation to nuclear material , as soon as the recipient state , as in this Convention has provided the responsibility to take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; the organization leads documents , from which each transfer and if necessary , the recovery of the backup measures emerge on the further level of nuclear material . &quot;
&quot; should nuclear material , the backup measures according to this Convention is subject to non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of allo@@ ys or ceramics , so in which circumstances the community agreed with the organisation of such use of material , under which circumstances the backup measures will be termin@@ ated according to this agreement with regard to this material . &quot;
II ) That the Ker@@ material is used during the duration of non @-@ application of the backup measures according to this agreement is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear tor@@ ches .
&quot; B ) The organization and community meet a regulation , that the backup measures specified in this Convention will not be used for as long as the core material used in such an activity . &quot;
&quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these backup measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures will be applied once again , as soon as the core material is resum@@ ed again a peaceful nuclear work . &quot;
&quot; the organization is set out over the total and composition of this material in the concerned state , or in the concerned states , and on each passing of such material from this state or other states on the ongoing basis . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it only extends to affairs like among other , temporary and proced@@ ural provisions and regulations for the coverage , but does not include a endor@@ sement or the understanding of the military activity , and also does not refer to the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the States bear the costs that each of them grow to conduct their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; arise by the community , the states or individuals who are subject to its territory , but non @-@ ass@@ ass@@ inated costs as a result of a particular discretion of the organization , so will be rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed by the organization , provided that they are fully prepared in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation contributes to the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , which are required by the inspection of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and states ensure that the liability for nu@@ cl@@ e@@ are damages , including an insurance or other financial security , according to their laws and other regulations , according to their laws and other regulations for the purpose of implementing the Convention in the same way , appears as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the community or a State against the organization or the organization in relation to the organization or the state of damages - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident - claimed to be governed by implementing the backup measures following this Convention , is governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; if the Council fails to examine the information given by him from the General Director , that the organisation is not able to commit themselves by post @-@ examination , that no core material , which shall be adopted according to this agreement , for nuclear weapons or other core spr@@ inkl@@ es , so he may take the report provided in Article XII paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes , and where appropriate measures will also take place . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council in which measure was achieved by the applied backup measures imposed by the Community or the State - as far as each of the two contractual parties is affected - every reasonable opportunity to provide the Council to provide the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or a state consultation on questions that arise from the interpretation or use of the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states are entitled to seek , therefore , that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention can be tested by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the state of such questions by the Council .

the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the process in carrying out the provisions of the part I for backup measures as required .
the aim of the procedures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the diver@@ gence significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nu@@ cl@@ ing activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other core spr@@ inkl@@ ers for un@@ known purposes as well as the deter@@ rent of such a devi@@ ation by the risk of an early discovery .
&quot; for the enrich@@ ing of the in Article 28 , the material book@@ keeping is of fundamental importance , composite with the spatial input and observation of an important compl@@ ementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of insp@@ ections by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for any material image zone , which is specified for a specified period of time under specification of the degree of accuracy for the specified oceans . &quot;
&quot; when carrying out their after@@ test , the organisation makes for articles 3 full use of the backup system of the community . &quot;
the book@@ keeping and control system of the community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on inclusion in material pictures .
&quot; when using their backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures of the following kind of use will make use of it , as far as necessary to see how they are determined and serves in the compl@@ ementary instructions : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system for determining the amounts of preser@@ v@@ eting , mis@@ led , abandoned , abandoned , or in other ways out of the continu@@ ance of remote material and of the components . &quot;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measuring security ;

e ) Proced@@ ure for evaluating claims not reported stocks and not common losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which consisted for every material image zone and the changes of this order including the one - and outputs of the material image zone . &quot;
&quot; g ) precau@@ tions , ensure that the accounting procedures and measures correctly carried out correctly ; &quot;
H ) Proced@@ ure for the refund of reports to the organization in accordance with the items 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the backup measures according to this Convention are not made on the material in the mining industry or in the Ore preparation .
&quot; B ) it has not yet reached Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ph@@ ant material that has not yet reached in the states , the community of organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material if it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves the core material that is suited to composition and purity for fuel production or the process phase , in which it is produced , or becomes this core material or else , introduced in a later stage of the nuclear power cycle into the states , so it is subject to the other used backup measures . &quot;
&quot; a ) The precau@@ tions proposed in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the conditions stipul@@ ated in Article 11 , the community , however , is not liable for the recovery of nuclear material , the backup measures for this Convention is not possible or solic@@ it , so consult the organization and the fel@@ lowship with each other about the application of appropriate security measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The precau@@ tions proposed in this Convention will be termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community should determine that this core material is practically non @-@ refundable . &quot;
&quot; in search of the community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following nuclear material from the backup measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special sp@@ read@@ able material if it is used in gram@@ ms or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) nuclear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , in case such nuclear material is reco@@ ver@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a Is@@ ot@@ open@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 that is over 80 % .
&quot; looking for the community liber@@ ates the organization of nuclear material , the otherwise backup measures for this Convention would be subject to these backup measures , provided that the whole , due to this article in the states of fre@@ ite core materi@@ alism at no time is more than &quot;
a ) a total of a kilo@@ grams of special p@@ ile material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying his weight with the enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment that lies under 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural uran &quot;
B ) a total of ten met@@ ric tons of natural gas and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty met@@ ric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) or among them ;
&quot; should be fre@@ ed core material along with core material , which is subject to the backup measures according to this agreement , processed or stored , so they shall be made for re@@ application of security measures on the material . &quot;

&quot; the compl@@ em@@ ents can be amended or changed without change of the Convention , between the organization and the community . &quot;
&quot; the compl@@ ementary pul@@ ses occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States are all efforts to step into force ; an extension of this period is needed between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; the organization is based on the basis of article 62 named initial report of the whole , the backup measures of the Convention on the United States , irrespective of its origin , and results in the survey based on the following reports and results of their after@@ test results . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ EM@@ ENT , NA@@ CH@@ MAR@@ H@@ EN@@ DER GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC agreed to help the direct requirement of individual countries with low income , whose development is disabled through general remains of sour@@ ced issues . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States , that the whole of the Member States will take place within six months of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years of entry into force of loans , and the organization will be able to do so that this goal is achieved . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the Organization have cons@@ ulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the intermedi@@ aries to ensure a broad and balanced geographic distribution agreement within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC presented a table from which it is apparent in which way they intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization is a special account among the term &quot; &quot; special response account &quot; &quot; which consists of the funds in accordance with this agreement ; this account is conducted by the organization as a car@@ et@@ aker and used ( in this property the organization referred to as &quot; st@@ ew@@ ter &quot; ) , and only to that agreement specified in this agreement , and according to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special account is separately and separated from all other accounts and activ@@ ates of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or imp@@ lic@@ able deb@@ tors , which are on request in the currency of the country in order to pay an account of the organization as an administrator of the organization in the country in question . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment is carried out in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . H . the amount of 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the Bo@@ at@@ ter agreed time ; &quot;
II ) the second in height of the remainder of the contribution to the 1 . January 1979 or at another time that was agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker in taking into account the required dates required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget .
C ) Every@@ one member state can do payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the dis@@ proportionate Zion@@ ings takes place on the cash or the deb@@ tors , in order to cover the expenditure on the special appeal and the special response in a reasonable way . &quot;
&quot; in case of gran@@ ting this loan , the for@@ et@@ aker can be guided according to the terms of the EEC of the following factors : &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and un@@ predic@@ table economic problems of the country ;
&quot; VI ) the composition and the tendency of debt service in the country and its further credit cards , without delay ; and &quot;
VII ) the extent that the problems of the countries concerned can regulate contributions from other sources .
&quot; any special response loan is aimed at financing a clear and rapid development programme or project ( including a sect@@ oral programme ) , regardless of whether it is a loan Programme of the organization or not , according to the proceedings and practices that the pre@@ am@@ ble means to take account of the pre@@ am@@ ble ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement is the objective of giving . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special response account may not be used instead of the resources of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which is already approved in the context of a loan or credit card , which is already approved by the directors of the Bank or organisation . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 are subject to special response to the same resi@@ dual conditions , which apply to the organization provided for the organization ; they are therefore payable for ten years of age in 50 years . &quot;
special teams are granted in one or more currencies of the member states and are refundable in these currencies .
&quot; amounts to payment of these command@@ ments are directly to the organization , which ret@@ ains them . &quot;
&quot; every special response loan is characterized by a separate depic@@ tion agreement between the receiver and the for@@ et@@ aker , in which in particular the origin of the means is stated . &quot;
&quot; the revenue from any special response can be used for edi@@ tions in the currency of the beneficiaries , or for goods or services , which are produced in developing countries ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and the according to the measure of what the car@@ et@@ akers may be established at the time of the loan granted , the recipient of a special response . &quot;
&quot; capital deposits of special authorities take place on the special response account , and thus the amount paid in the currency of a member state shall return to the relevant member states as soon as possible . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker gives the EEC to complete all special response to the EEC relating to the review by the directors in preparation and by the directors approved in preparation and by the directors approved projects and programmes .
&quot; during the period of payout of the special response , the car@@ et@@ aker has taught the EEC quar@@ terly each year on the development of the special response units and the spending . &quot;
the administrator submitted the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the business year of the organization an exhaus@@ tion of the special response account with an opinion of the external calcul@@ ators of the organization on this account .
&quot; following the payout of the special response , the car@@ et@@ aker the EEC submitted to the EEC as soon as possible a detailed report on the funded projects and programmes . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker created and brings suitable records and accounting , from which the contributions to the special response account granted to the account received and paid out of the account received from the account amounts and the pay@@ outs of the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together for achieving the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker to the full issue of the means of special response from time to time a thought exchange on the state of the special response account , the progressive programmes or plans and over all other questions that concern the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will be agreed on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organization may be agreed upon , not into force , so the agreement and all of the resulting obligations of the parties are dis@@ rup@@ tible with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; the entire capital amount of all contribut@@ ors to this agreement is returned , according to Article II section 8 of this Agreement , and transferred to the Member States , so this agreement and all of the resulting obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;

in the form of a letter between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on trade with Ham@@ mel - and Lamb .
&quot; I refer to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish rules over the import@@ ation of Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b - and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are as follows : &quot;
- Fresh or cooled Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the ex@@ changing possibilities for Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b - and goat meat from Argentina to the Community has put on the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle @-@ body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a fl@@ aw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the actual amount of the annual amount has not exc@@ eeds the agreed amount and executed according to the conventional quot@@ as ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the quot@@ ation form of changes in technology and trade are possible , the two parties of this agreement will consult each other before introducing such a change in the subject number 10 mentioned committee to find adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community particip@@ ates the protection clause , it is obliged to bear the care that the access of Argentina was not touched by Argentina to the community market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the entries from Argentina can exceed the agreed amounts of Argentina in one year , the community reserves the right to exp@@ ire from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community is obliged to restrict the exhaus@@ tion on immigrants from this agreement to a stool of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the number 2 determined quantity according to the extent of Argentin@@ ean market with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty , the entry fee for these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; here the number 5 mentioned above @-@ value added tax will be charged . &quot;
&quot; the total amount will set among the number 2 mentioned above , with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 23 000 tons of battle @-@ body weight . &quot;
&quot; the community takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argentin@@ ean Ham@@ mel - and lam@@ b working on the community market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; special meets the community arrangements , so that the ship@@ ments of interven@@ tion@@ ists in frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation to the paragraph of Argent@@ ine Ham@@ mel - and Lamb is not under@@ min@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the community agreed that any actual application of equipment or other funding measures for the export of Ham@@ mel and lam@@ bs , as well as for the s@@ laughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , with the existing international commitments are in line and take into account the traditional share of the community at world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 ) ( s c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of the Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and trade agreement . &quot;

the details for the application of this system will be defined that on the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ing of the immigration licence for the disp@@ ens@@ ary products .
&quot; in passage regulations , the competent authorities of the competent authority of the competent authorities have been issued upon the responsible body of the community in regular intervals ; these details are necessary according to identification land . &quot;
the committee shall bear the concern that the agreement is properly applied and faul@@ t@@ lessly .
&quot; he regularly checks the tendency on the Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b - and goat flesh , the two parties , and on the world market as well as sales conditions on these markets , including conditions that are of importance to the number 7 mentioned goal . &quot;
&quot; the committee shall bear witness that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by that products from Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b - and goat meat , under the agreement will not be executed in the tariff numbers . &quot;
the committee discussed all these agreements with the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement apply in@@ descri@@ bing the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
