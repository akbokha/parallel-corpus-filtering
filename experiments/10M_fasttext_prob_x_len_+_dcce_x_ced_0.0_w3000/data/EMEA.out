&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Security Council ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains the studies conducted by the Committee on Human@@ geons ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to assess recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or its treatment , please read the packages ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to receive further information about the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of mel@@ ting tablets , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as inj@@ ecting solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. Consu@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic condition , in which the patients have varied episodes ( periods ab@@ normal high tuning ) with periods of normal tuning . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy is applied for the treatment of intermediate to severe man@@ ic episodes and prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients suffering from the past of the drug , used in the past . &quot;
injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorder when the or@@ ale intake of the medication is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be applied to one or the mel@@ ting @-@ tablets in patients who are being prepared to cure tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adapted from A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication between nerve cells among each other . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial Ag@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( including ser@@ otonin ) . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and D@@ op@@ amine , but in less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter acts to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain to norm@@ alize , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy &apos;s effectiveness , to prevent the encounter of symptoms , was investigated in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of inj@@ ecting solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , or similar diseases , which compared to increased un@@ rest , compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a further study , A@@ bili@@ fy took over 12 weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of a@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo that have been stabili@@ zed in 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabil@@ ised with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that compared to increased un@@ rest ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours compared .
&quot; in all studies , the changes in the symptoms of the patients were examined using a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients carrying on treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also led studies to investigate how the body over@@ hau@@ l the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets , and the solution to cap@@ turing . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significant reduction in symptoms increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the application for treatment of bi@@ polar disorder has decreased A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five Kur@@ zz@@ lement studies more effective than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy prevented also up to 74 weeks long more effective than plac@@ ebo the re @-@ occur Man@@ ic episodes previously treated with patients and if it was added in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses are also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms increased un@@ rest and were similar effectively as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , mess@@ enger ( sl@@ ing ) , nau@@ ght@@ ness , nau@@ sea ) , sali@@ va ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) aimed at the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes filmed on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the result that the benefits of inj@@ ecting solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder , if an or@@ ale therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission shared the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a licence for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is prescribed for treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episode in the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended initial dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at an entertainment dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
&quot; a increased effectiveness in doses , over a day dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
the recommended initial dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combined therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar disorder in patients &gt; 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initi@@ al@@ osis should be considered as clinical factors to justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 investig@@ ator is set off from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dosage should be reduced to recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the appearance of su@@ ic@@ ide behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases at the beginning or after a change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy even in treating with Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder they have no increased addi@@ ction risk with Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ac disease , cardi@@ ac disease , cardi@@ ac disease , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which gave a year or less di@@ gesti@@ ble , there were occasion@@ al reports on during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l up@@ surge Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
if at one with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
&quot; if a patient has developed signs and symptoms that indicate to a m@@ ns , or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ oti@@ ka , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , must be set . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l should be applied in patients with Kr@@ amp@@ fan@@ accidents in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states that are applied with cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ accidents in connection with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ osis who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients having treated with Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l were treated as compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for unwanted cerem@@ onial events with Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ov or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk of risk @-@ related events associated with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents to treat patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of a deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose values . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally achieved in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ined patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , which is gaining weight as side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines such as se@@ dition ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a mag@@ ens@@ c blo@@ cker , reduces the restructuring rate of Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is however not relevant as a clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical trial with healthy rehear@@ sals a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ ine ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l around 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore similar tin @-@ reduction devices should be done . &quot;
&quot; with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abol@@ ising the common application can result in high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plastic @-@ centralized populations of Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l , compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ ders Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ern . &quot;
&quot; when you consider the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should prevail to the patient &apos;s potential risks . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , thir@@ ties have similar effects and therefore similar tin @-@ reduction devices should be done . &quot;
&quot; after signing the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted to the dosage height before the start of the companion therapy . &quot;
&quot; dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y will be administ@@ ered together with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations . &quot;
in clinical trials included doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ Rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 7 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be forced to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy over the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to insufficient data base for safety when humans and due to the application studies in animal studies may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the possible benefit clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , with other anti@@ psych@@ otic patients , patients should be war@@ ned of hazardous machines , including power vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 ) on than below plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the listed side effects is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks entered into patients with Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ ism , Acc@@ ath@@ onie , d@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo controlled long @-@ term study the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study , over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % were treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l and 15,@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes of Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in a different study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium treatment .
in the long @-@ time detection phase over 26 weeks at a plac@@ ebo controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
&quot; comparison between the patient @-@ groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , y@@ iel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ phosph@@ ate ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l patients , compared to 2.9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects that may occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and on whose appearance also been reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and Kr@@ amp@@ fan@@ inci@@ dents , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional quot@@ ations were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the effectiveness of an en@@ roll@@ ment in treating an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely to have a high plas@@ modi@@ tization in treating an over@@ dose of benefits since Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l has a high plas@@ ma connection . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder about the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect is convey@@ ed on Ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vit@@ ro a high affin@@ ity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ or and to the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ or and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to the alpha @-@ 1 @-@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or . &quot;
&quot; with gift from Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l in doses from 0,5 to 30 mg once every day over 2 weeks , the Pos@@ it@@ ops @-@ E@@ missions @-@ Tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction in the binary of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 recept@@ or Lig@@ uria , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the coup . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ased patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l compared to plac@@ ebo an statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study was 52 of the share of the resp@@ onder patients , which was a cont@@ acting to the study medication , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values in Mess@@ als , which were defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants scale , showed a significant stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo controlled study over 26 weeks at stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia showed itself a significantly higher reduction of revers@@ al rate that lay at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ es@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in an o@@ lan@@ o @-@ controlled , multinational twin @-@ blind study involving schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients were re@@ marked with minimum score of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of approx . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage about 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l a compared to plac@@ ebo superior efficacy during reducing symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l towards plac@@ ebo no superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or bl@@ ended episode , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparison with plac@@ ebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a maintenance effect , which was comparable to that of li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l pointed out in week 12 a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ y on such as li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or bl@@ ended episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks do not reflect Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic supplements , compared to mon@@ otherapy with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;

&quot; at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as the patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects on a pharmac@@ ist examination . &quot;
a large @-@ specific evaluation to the pharmaceutical ine@@ tics had no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in the ethnic group or the effect of smoking on the phar@@ a@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l .
pharmac@@ euticals &apos;s pharmac@@ euticals and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study on trial with different clim@@ bers , liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ugh Class A , B and C ) showed not only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabo@@ lic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeti@@ tion@@ ism , reproduction , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and the can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the pre@@ clinical data have no particular dangers for man . &quot;

AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y inj@@ ecting solution is used for rapid control of artic@@ ulators and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder disorder if an or@@ ale therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be ended with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution and commen@@ ced with the or@@ alist application of Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability is an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ id or deep within the glut@@ eus @-@ Maxim@@ us muscle under re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation of adi@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5,25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can depend on the individual clinical status taking into account the drugs used or acoustic therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .

there are no investigations into the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ecting solution in patients with Agi@@ tic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been different from schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ecting solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dition or a blood pressure if ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
research on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ecting solution are not available for patients with alcohol or medicine ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .

&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , sore muscles , changing consciousness , and signs of autonomous instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of a deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose values . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ined patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines which is known as secondary @-@ effect and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was bigger compared to the all@@ evi@@ ate of Ari@@ pi@@ di@@ zo@@ l , in a study , in the healthy Pro@@ b@@ anden Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg of dose ) as a single @-@ in@@ tra in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular ( 15 mg of dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters of an anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine had received . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane untreated patients on the treatment , towards 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients , the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el enth@@ eses received . &quot;
&quot; if one sees only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference in terms of the disease wor@@ sen@@ ators such as time to deterioration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients were obtained in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug . &quot;
&quot; it must also not be applied to patients , the breast@@ feeding or before the start of treatment low ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ y figures in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) stated that the initial treatment was no longer propos@@ ing , more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines was and that it has to be given in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines and that it has to be given in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , to reduce side effects . &quot;
January 2008 the European Commission shared the Commissioner Bios@@ cience Limited - a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .

P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ uli which promotes the cl@@ ergy of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by the im@@ itation of its depend@@ ability .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ arian network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis has been convey@@ ed to the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of Plas@@ mak@@ om@@ pon@@ ents in the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ per cells and in the frame of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies has been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el fo@@ sters through the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ per cells .

&quot; it is produced by a cell that has been brought into a gene ( DNA ) , which is able to form the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a v@@ ene in the framework of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients , which caused by kidney problems , with the reference nit@@ rogen . &quot;
&quot; all patients participating in this study was at least eight weeks long E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a veins , before they were either entr@@ amed to se@@ amed or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
the main index of the efficacy was the change in Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ omy between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company laid out the results of a study where the effects of u@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined using those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer victims that have received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients , which caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ at@@ glo@@ omy values of patients were killed on se@@ perate , in the same degree as with the patient who continued to be E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients showed the E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , a rise of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of an end@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging head@@ aches and per@@ tin@@ ess . &quot;
se@@ perate shouldn &apos;t be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ecting under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney disease , as further studies are required to ensure that this is triggered by no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the committee on human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) initiated to the conclusion that the drug was made up of evidence in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of proof that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which represents Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information for medical specialists in all Member States information packages , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
August 2007 the European Commission shared with the company Medi@@ ce medicines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed within the entire European Union .

8 For patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency should not be passed on under Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in @-@ target @-@ concentration .
in clinical trials they have been observed an increased mor@@ tal risks and risk of serious cardiovascular substances ( ESA ) with a hem@@ at@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target @-@ concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were given .
controlled clinical trials showed no significant benefits that is attri@@ but@@ able to the gift of epo@@ xy symptom and increased concentration on the control of accumul@@ ating symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions is increased .
the her@@ mo@@ glo@@ om@@ bin@@ s should be about 1 g / dl ( CR@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency and clin@@ ically evi@@ denti@@ al coron@@ ary heart disease or storage in@@ suff@@ iciency should not be passed on under Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in targets .
&quot; after the time of present knowledge is projected through the treatment of an@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ tic , the progression of kidney suff@@ iciency is not accelerated . &quot;
in tum@@ our patients under chemotherapy should be taken into account for assessing the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response must be considered ( patients who may have to be trans@@ duc@@ ted ) .

&quot; the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing under the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for larger elect@@ oral orthop@@ a@@ edic intervention , if possible , prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who under@@ go to a greater elect@@ oral orthop@@ edic surgery , as they should have an increased risk of thro@@ po@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly at an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting mo@@ und glo@@ omy output of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk for post@@ operative thro@@ po@@ bot@@ any / vas@@ cular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , for epo@@ et@@ ine studies have not proven that they can improve overall survival with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumor . &quot;

&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied together with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in is controlled and the Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ ind@@ osis can be adapted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; from in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ investigations on tum@@ our , there are no evidence of a interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF with regard to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; about thro@@ po@@ bot@@ any , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ess , cer@@ ne@@ y@@ ves@@ ant , arter@@ ial thy@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thy@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thy@@ ro@@ id , arter@@ ial mo@@ ist , arter@@ ial mo@@ unts was reported in patients under Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase of blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of cardiovascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
independent of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease and vas@@ cular complications occur .

survival and tum@@ our were examined in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double blind @-@ controlled studies and
in the open trial there was no difference in the overall survival between the patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients and the check@@ ers .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients treated with an an@@ emia due to various more common Mal@@ ign@@ ome consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than with controls . &quot;
the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis and therefore related complications connected with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients and at checks satisfactory .
&quot; there is an increased risk for thro@@ mbo@@ lic bol@@ ting events in tum@@ our patients , which are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are treated to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tum@@ our patients with the aim of transferring a hem@@ at@@ glo@@ om@@ ine under 13 g / dl , as a few patients were included with these characteristics in the insp@@ ected data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ time period of approximately 4 hours in healthy rehear@@ sals and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ time period of about 5 hours in patients with kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency .
&quot; according to sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections are the ser@@ um mirror of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa much lower than the ser@@ um mirror , which can be achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;

&quot; very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasion@@ al ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( &gt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted resi@@ dual effects are listed in chart 1 . &quot;
kidney function dis@@ rup@@ ting Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was expressed in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in the kidney function ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured year prior to administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were compared with oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of the Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values occurred below 2.3 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical trial treated in comparison to 21 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on the post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures after a gir@@ der and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on avoiding clinical trials , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an Initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion set , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the j@@ aw area is acci@@ dentally , above all in cancer victims , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area ) reported the with bis@@ phosph@@ ate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer victims or dental treatment . &quot;
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients had oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tics at one with A@@ cl@@ asta and at one with plac@@ ebo treated patients .
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ gly@@ co@@ emia , can be achieved through gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous Inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ ing . &quot;
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 ) have been shown at either a bone dich@@ ot@@ or ( BM@@ D ) or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the thig@@ h furniture or a BM@@ D @-@ T score with or without sign of an existing back@@ bone structure .
effects on morph@@ ometric authentic@@ ation A@@ cl@@ asta lo@@ wered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new sp@@ inal frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had decreased by 60 % reduced risk for sp@@ inal fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 0001 ) .
&quot; effects on hip re@@ frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta pointed out an equal effect over three years , which resulted in a total of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk to hip re@@ frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on the bone @-@ density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta elevated the bone density , compared with the plac@@ ebo treatment , compared with the plac@@ ebo therapy compared to all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increasing the bone @-@ density of the lum@@ bar thickness around 6,@@ 7 % , the whole hips by 6,0 % , the thig@@ h to 5.5 % , and the dist@@ al radius by 3.8 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology At the 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients , which were treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of Kno@@ chen@@ bi@@ op@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ enk@@ amm . &quot;
a micro@@ computer @-@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed up to plac@@ ebo an increase in the tr@@ ul@@ ular Kno@@ chen@@ vol@@ um@@ ens and the preservation of the tr@@ ul@@ ular bone architecture .
&quot; Kno@@ chen@@ um@@ mark@@ er The bones @-@ specific al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pe@@ p@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in Ser@@ um , and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in Ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odi@@ c intervals during courses . &quot;
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dosage A@@ cl@@ asta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months are significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the output value and was held at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept under 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output point after 12 months and was kept under 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D @-@ mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
overall mort@@ ality was at 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group of A@@ cl@@ asta treated Group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ Study increased the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D in the total and thig@@ h at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment performed more than 24 months compared to the plac@@ ebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.2 % of the total and by 4.3 % at the thig@@ h .
clinical effectiveness in men In the HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study were random@@ ized 5@@ 08 men random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged after 24 months .
&quot; the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fr@@ ac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % with A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8,@@ 7 % at plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) was once again annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta as compared to the percentage of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at compared to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the output value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone A@@ cl@@ asta was examined to patients aged over 30 years ago ( medium Ser@@ um @-@ mirror of al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ times up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold @-@ specific upper standard at recording in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once every day during 2 months has been proven in two six months studies .
the combined results was observed after 6 months a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain @-@ influenced by the output value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified at the end of the sixth main stage as Resp@@ ect ( on the therapy addressed ) could be recorded in an early monitoring phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients who participated in follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic an@@ speak with 141 of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared with 71 of the treatment in Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients , are preserved during a medium duration of the decre@@ asing period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients in the following pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic data that proved to be dos@@ ed independently . &quot;
&quot; after that the plas@@ mas@@ hall quickly took up on &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; ra@@ w@@ anese dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ value times , ½ α draft and t ½ β lessons , followed by a long elimination of Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ s@@ wer@@ s@@ time t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early anni@@ hil@@ ation phases ( α and β with the above @-@ mentioned ½ -@@ values ) will probably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption of bone and ex@@ cre@@ tion about the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the administ@@ ered dose in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ - concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion - but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plas@@ on@@ cent@@ re@@ ation against time ) .
a dimin@@ ishing Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ outh metabo@@ lic substances is unlikely to be metabo@@ li@@ zed because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in humans are not metabo@@ li@@ zed and because it is a watch@@ man or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , oxygen @-@ dependent In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient @-@ groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ tic acid , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was used for 64 periods of 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in fact that an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
there is only limited data for heavy kidney dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are not possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest not let@@ al acting intraven@@ ous single dose was with mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; for studies in dogs , individuals of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administ@@ ered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al removal . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic Tox@@ icity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al compatibility of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats has been administ@@ ered at intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7@@ down the human therapeutic exposure , referred to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , equivalent to the AU@@ C , equivalent to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeti@@ tive application in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , the maximum of the intended human exposure was sufficiently over@@ exceeded , toxic effects on other organs , including the Gast@@ ro@@ un@@ in@@ al@@ tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings and studies with repeti@@ tive application was a multip@@ lied spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aph@@ hy@@ se of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all dos@@ ages , an fertili@@ zation and that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ atory effect of the substance . &quot;
at rats you watched a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ class , called Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ rogen , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; when Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et is carried out the bone structure too fast , and new bone material is arranged un@@ arranged , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta acts by setting up the bone structure again norm@@ alized , thereby creating a normal bone @-@ formation and gives the bones again strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or under@@ go a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; using A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff , if you have other medicines / apply or recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines out of which it is the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; for application of A@@ cl@@ asta together with food and beverages you worry that , in accordance with the instructions of your doctor enough fluid , before and after the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administ@@ ered by your doctor or care professionals as inf@@ usion in a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , is advised to make the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operational care of hip . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et The usual dose is 5 mg that is administ@@ ered by your doctor or care staff as inf@@ usion in a v@@ ein .
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ asta for a long time works , you will be necessary for a further dose only after a year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in time after inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta missed was set to arrange an appointment with your doctor or hospital in order to make a new appointment .
&quot; before the end of therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta If you consider the end of the treatment with as@@ cl@@ asta actu@@ ators , please contact your next physician reviews and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion occur very often on ( with more than 30 % of patients ) are after the subsequent inf@@ usions but less frequent .
&quot; fever and sho@@ ok , muscle , or joint pain , and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ asta this un@@ regular heart attack , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms , after you have received A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

&quot; if the drug is not directly used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently learned low @-@ trau@@ mati@@ cal cont@@ ac@@ upuncture is recommended to make the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operating supply of hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , the patients must be adequately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive an di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at the bone structure , it can develop a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the Inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta occurs . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium , accordingly at least twice a day 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently learned low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the Inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ LIA was used in comparison to a plac@@ ebo as a suppor@@ tive means of setting the smoking . &quot;
&quot; the studies on setting up the smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LIA was difficult to assess this application . &quot;
what is the risk associated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , nau@@ sea were observed ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respir@@ atory . n@@ g The complete listing of the associated side effects associated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA were reported side @-@ side effects . &quot;
&quot; it may also be applied to patients who suffer from an existing serious depression or treated with anti@@ depress@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression , and among other things a small minority can emerge from patients . &quot;

&quot; the summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Code of Justice ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains the studies conducted by the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to assess recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as not ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which Met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ cian ) is not displayed . • It can be applied together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can not be adjusted to the highest toler@@ able dose than alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ental or ins@@ ulin can be retained in patients with hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( lower blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ental or ins@@ ulin is to be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be improved , and the blood sugar levels can be improved , which can be better adjusted from type @-@ 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 400 patients were examined the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ ology ; thereby , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl har@@ ms , in addition they received up to 3,5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood has been measured in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which shows how good the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos resulted in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which ensures that the blood sugar levels have been reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the trig@@ gering study , the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 280 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin in 28@@ 9 patients were examined , patients who participated in addition to ins@@ ulin , a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 3 % after 6 months , compared with 0.7 % in patients who participated in addition to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( al@@ k@@ ables ) , weight gain and Hy@@ po@@ es@@ th@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos must not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or any of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or di@@ ab@@ etic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ki@@ ebox - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metals in patients , in which met@@ form@@ ers is not shown . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission shared the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited licence for the transport of accounts in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white until white , round , curved and carry on one side the &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the title &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also shown for the combination of ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with ins@@ ulin , and in which met@@ form@@ in due to contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ations or in@@ compatibility is in@@ appropriate ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age are not available , so the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor ( e.g. past her@@ nia ) or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart suff@@ iciency , weight gain or eyel@@ id , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardi@@ ac Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease has been carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports relating to heart suff@@ iciency , which resulted not to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output @-@ liver enzy@@ me ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard range ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
&quot; if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror increases up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzy@@ mes are as soon as possible to control . &quot;
&quot; if a patient symptoms developed to point out on a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved , v@@ om@@ iting , fatigue , appeti@@ te @-@ less@@ ness and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ mes to check . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be continued until the top of the laboratory parameters should be led by the clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been proven to be a dos@@ er dependent weight , which can be stir@@ red by fats and in some cases with a fluid head . &quot;
as a result of a ha@@ yst@@ er@@ ution came under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a lower reduction of the medium her@@ mo@@ glo@@ omy ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.3 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under metal reduction ( relative reduction of hem@@ at@@ glo@@ bin@@ s ) and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ at@@ glo@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased in@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity consists of patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral or triple combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; following the market launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ an indi@@ an , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , reported on a appearance or deterioration of a di@@ ab@@ etic Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms with a reduction in visual ac@@ ul@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether between taking pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men , there are a direct connection , but ass@@ ass@@ ing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms if patient report about disorders of visual impair@@ ments shall be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports unwanted events regarding bone br@@ akes , controlled , dou@@ blin@@ ded clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
the exhaus@@ tive frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 Fr@@ ak@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.@@ 1 Fr@@ ak@@ ements per 100 patient years in women who have been treated with a compar@@ ative medicine .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , c@@ ac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.5 % ; 1,0 Fr@@ ak@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with patients who have been treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is ab@@ duc@@ ted ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ euticals or pharmac@@ euticals , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and metals . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , for example or@@ ale contr@@ az@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulting in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 input ) resulting in a reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is attri@@ but@@ able that in the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on that dimin@@ ished in pregnancy and increased in@@ ins@@ ulin resistance of the mother@@ hood and thus reduces the availability of the metabo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for the lower growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from present data not refundable ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ mo@@ ors and the b@@ illing index@@ es of the lens as they are also observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on occurred AL@@ T attachments , over the Triple @-@ border of the norm@@ alisation joined as often below plac@@ ebo , but less rare than in compar@@ ative groups among metal @-@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was the frequency of heavy cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency between Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than below plac@@ ebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since the market launch , it has been reported about cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency among Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was applied in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it became a summary analysis of messages unwanted events regarding bone br@@ aces from random@@ ized , controlled , double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ ative medi@@ ums to be carried out . &quot;
&quot; in the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , fr@@ ac@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.5 % ) of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; when the reported high @-@ dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to act via an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) to increase what in the animal model leads to an increased in@@ sensi@@ tiveness of liver and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose de@@ valuation in the case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study involving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the result of the therapeutic effects ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &gt; 8,@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the treatment of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of the patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo@@ arding study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar had been inadequate in spite of three mon@@ ati@@ cal optimization phase with ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value for 0,45 % , compared to the patients who still received only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction in isl@@ anders treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on Group has been observed . &quot;
in clinical trials over one year the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant reduction of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ ces compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was examined in a small , on 18 weeks of the examination of type @-@ 2 @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies were observed in comparison to plac@@ ebo a reduction of overall plas@@ ma @-@ tri@@ gly@@ ca@@ stration and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in comparison to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plas@@ ma gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level . &quot;
compared to plac@@ ebo under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one no statisti@@ cally significant increase of the L@@ DL cholesterol level was observed while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values were observed .
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks of reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , not only the so@@ ber @-@ Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but improved also the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ mirror , this also improves the effect of the tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ sourcing study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease in groups , in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; according to oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ ably , whereby the top centr@@ alised pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on usually reaches 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV are equivalent to efficacy in about the triple the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ action studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on could not be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ euticals or pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic dynamics , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and metals . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 In@@ du@@ ecker ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 In@@ du@@ ector ) or lo@@ wers the plas@@ on@@ cent@@ ric of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after an application of radio@@ active mark@@ ers Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mark@@ er was found mainly in f@@ eces ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean plas@@ ma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ wer@@ se of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to the people 5 @-@ 6 hours and that of the entire active met@@ abol@@ ites is at 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plastic @-@ cent@@ en@@ centr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function , whereby the ration@@ ales of the or@@ al clear@@ ness of the mother@@ hood was more similar . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies performed in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys dis@@ agreement according to repeti@@ tive appointments plas@@ ma volume with ha@@ yst@@ er@@ ution , an@@ emia and re@@ versi@@ bler ex@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hies . &quot;
this is due to attri@@ but@@ able that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ished in the con@@ dens@@ ation of the native hyper@@ insul@@ as and increased in@@ ins@@ ulin resistance of the mother@@ hood and thus reduces the availability of the metabo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for the lower growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were in@@ duced by the Rat for inci@@ dents of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epith@@ eli@@ um .
in a animal model of the family n@@ anny Pol@@ yp@@ osis ( FA@@ P ) carried out the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ th@@ Indi@@ ans to an increased frequency of color@@ ectal cancer .
&quot; the tablets are white up to white , round , shallow and carry on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the title &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
the exhaus@@ tive frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 Fr@@ ak@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.@@ 1 Fr@@ ak@@ ements per 100 patient years in women who have been treated with a compar@@ ative medicine .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , c@@ ac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.5 % ; 1,0 Fr@@ ak@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with patients who have been treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
in a further study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were examined .
clinical trials over 1 year showed itself a statisti@@ cally significant reduction in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ ces compared to the output values .
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks of reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , not only the so@@ ber @-@ Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but improved also the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ mirror , this both over an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de absorption and the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study responded with regards to their primary end@@ point , which set a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ deadly cer@@ yo@@ car@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , put the results close , that with the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on are not associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane has been produced in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as gland can produce no ins@@ ulin , and type @-@ 2 diabetes , where the body is not able to use ins@@ ulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how good the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an resulted in a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which suggests that the blood sugar levels was similar to a different human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ans should not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ans may need to be adjusted when combined with a number of other medicines you can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is the packages position ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) initiated to the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ cies over@@ thre@@ w the risks of diabetes against the risks .

&quot; if the change is necessary for a dosage adjustment in the patient , this can be necessary in the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions appear after a change of animal to human @-@ ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia was less pronounced or otherwise than with their previous ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; travelling , which go over several periods of time , the patient should be pointed out to take the Council of his doctor , since such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals have to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and his patients must always consult with other medicines .

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ all@@ procedures , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or gas@@ k@@ ill@@ ings ( &quot; stones . &quot; i.e. , larger document cryst@@ als , which can lead to joint and bone mar@@ riages ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level , after two to four weeks still is over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose can be increased once a day 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatments you can still experience g@@ ated accidents , so it is recommended that patients are taking at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic nor further medicines for prevention of gases . &quot;
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ@@ ist transpl@@ ant as it has not been studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , at the 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three of different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) with the one plac@@ ebo ( head@@ medi@@ ators ) and compared to Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different drug for treating hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 762 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney disease got only 100 mg per day .
&quot; main indi@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients , their ur@@ inary stock@@ ings in the blood with the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg participated , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once received a ur@@ inary tract in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was by 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and normal living . &quot;
&quot; in particular , in patients with heart attack in the pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the committee on human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) initiated to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary tract as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but there could also be a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and the blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to Ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ag@@ grad@@ ations ( including one out of the patient @-@ history , or currently present g@@ k@@ ick@@ ness ) . &quot;
if the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ so@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ ps after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still exists &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) can be considered a dosage increase at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , the efficacy and safety has not been completely investigated ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ so@@ fter medicines , it may occur during treatment starting to a acute coating , because by lowering the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ so@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els , first ur@@ ging operations can be mobili@@ zed in the tissues . &quot;

The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ BC were not conducted any interaction studies on Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ors can lead to an increase in the The@@ ophy@@ ll mirror ( a inhi@@ bit of the met@@ abol@@ ization of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; testing was the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ x@@ 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;

&quot; experimental studies cannot be excluded in direct or indirect effect on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful in the control of a car , payment of machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably priced , that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C is not affected by their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the test @-@ cardiovascular events was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ ux@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term - extension studies ( 1.9 million patients per 100 patient years ) and not found no statisti@@ cally significant connection with Feb@@ on@@ ost@@ at .

&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary energy point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there was no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ lic@@ tions in proportions , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;

&quot; the data collected in two years collected , that the phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ ps on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) a decrease of the incidence of g@@ ated waste required ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a fork carriage ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of g@@ allo@@ y size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the gas@@ k@@ ies until month 24 . &quot;
&quot; increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5,@@ 5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.5 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.2 % ) in the open long @-@ term trial studies ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are reduced ) in women after men@@ opause where a risk of low vitamin D mirror exists .
&quot; the patient must take tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or inclusion of other medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and Vit@@ amin@@ ants ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irrit@@ ation of es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take place until after the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet should not lie . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in pharmac@@ euticals , the company placed data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also led a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to follow the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients were treated with low vitamin D mirror in the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also put data on the fact that the contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE enth@@ alt@@ ed Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose is exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tive system , b@@ ending , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diges@@ tion ) , mon@@ stro@@ kes ( sle@@ e@@ era ) , mon@@ stro@@ kes ( sle@@ e@@ era ) , mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous abdom@@ en ( fl@@ aws ) , un@@ folded abdom@@ en ( fl@@ itting belly ) as well as so@@ ot@@ res . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components may not be applied AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in diseases of es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium mirror ) or in patients who can &apos;t stand at least 30 minutes long . &quot;
Janu@@ ary@@ - 2007 the European Commission shared the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .
&quot; capsule shaped , white until broken white tablets , marked with the tear of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or capture of medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and Vit@@ amin@@ ants ) for the day . &quot;
following notes are precisely to follow to reduce the risk of ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be lu@@ cked according to the insur@@ rection of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ ynge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ al bl@@ eeding or surgical procedures in the upper gast@@ ro@@ o@@ in@@ al@@ tract apart from P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , can be given only under particular caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; oil reactions , such as Ö@@ soph@@ agi@@ tis , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ sions , reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly were these severe and required a hospital assignment ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor is therefore intended to point out to all signs and symptoms that are to be noted on possible gender @-@ related reactions , such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain , in the case of symptoms or retro@@ stern@@ al pain , or new or ob@@ li@@ mm@@ akers of the so@@ ber burn the drugs and to get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe an@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients , which may not take the drug correctly and / or it after the appearance of symptoms that refer to a ös@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all met@@ ering instructions are passed on to patients and are understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large the clinical trials of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no higher risk has been found , rarely ( according to market launch ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and associated with complications ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the pine , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer victims , whose therapeutic ime mainly contains intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to give instructions whether or need a bite therapy in patients who need a ki@@ osk surgical procedure , which dimin@@ ished the risk of the oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the pine . &quot;
clinical assessment by the treatment doctor is important for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be reli@@ ed that they should be taking advantage of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after having noticed its failure .
&quot; you should take no two tablets per day , but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ tism ) should be treated at the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium @-@ supplements , antagon@@ azi@@ da and some or@@ ale drugs can imp@@ air the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait after the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific inter @-@ studies have not been performed , al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical studies have been taken jointly with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore is not intended to apply either during pregnancy or during pregnancy .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no reference to directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy that may recognize the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the pine was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , but most of the reports come from cancer patients , but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ os@@ ep@@ tual . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Ab@@ um of Ser@@ um @-@ Cal@@ ci@@ ums stood up to &lt; 8,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and Ser@@ um - phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2,@@ 0 mg / dl ( spec@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;

studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at The therapeutic equation of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year mul@@ tic@@ ent study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at on bone mass and frame of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( s = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the Fr@@ ac@@ upuncture study ( FIT : N = 6.@@ 459 ) .
in the phase III studies the middle analysis of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8,@@ 8 % at the sp@@ inal column ; 5.2 % on the fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7.3 % on the tro@@ ll@@ ter .
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at the group was achieved compared to the plac@@ ebo group 3.7 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age 3,@@ 2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6,@@ 2 % ) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more sp@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the trials of the BM@@ D of sp@@ ine and tro@@ ll@@ ter continue to continue ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ed studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continue to be taken over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at the occurrence of at least one new sp@@ ine ac@@ upuncture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

&quot; however , the bio@@ availability of bid@@ ding participated in accordance with around 350 % and peri@@ odi@@ c % , if Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at has been taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) is not a clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats have revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age is distributed to intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg temporarily in soft , but then quickly distributed in the bones or with the urine . &quot;
retirement After intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at were found approximately 50 % of radio@@ active substance within 72 hours with the urine test and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ eces .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic clear@@ ance exc@@ eeds 200 ml / min . &quot;
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not affected by rats above the sau@@ re or bas@@ eboard system of the kid@@ neys and therefore it is not assumed that when people affected the retirement of other medicines by this transport system .

&quot; character@@ is@@ ka in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at who is not exp@@ ired , fast over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although there is no clinical data about it , nevertheless it is to be reck@@ oned that the ren@@ al Eli@@ mination of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in animal must also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased Kum@@ ulation of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in bone has to be expected ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

advoc@@ acy is administ@@ ered adult patients administ@@ ered to have a kidney or liver det@@ ects to prevent a lax@@ ative of the tran@@ sit@@ ing organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft have already been deployed in the EU , the company has presented the results from the published studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft as well as data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transpl@@ ant , whereby the application of Adv@@ oc@@ raf was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gr@@ aft or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; main @-@ indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with which the transpl@@ ant was to@@ wed after a treatment of one year ( by considering , for example , how often a renewed organ transpl@@ ant or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , more recent studies of 119 patients were conducted with kidney transpl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ ant and investigated , such as Adv@@ ent raf in comparison to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gr@@ aft from the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro @-@ lid antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors have to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken at the same time with Adv@@ ent photographer as the Adv@@ ent dosage or the dose of the same medication may be adjusted accordingly .

&quot; only doctors , who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transpl@@ ant patients , this medicine should be compens@@ ated or changes in the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ splan@@ ts or to an increased incidence of side effects , including mal@@ or or over@@ immun@@ otherap@@ ists . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; transform@@ ations of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the narro@@ wing control of one in the transpl@@ ant experienced physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of advoc@@ acy should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of reb@@ illing and toler@@ ability in individual case , and on blood levels ( see below &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the change from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ent raf , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talents should be controlled before the switch and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 was the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a talent of mirror , with both form@@ ulations both in Ni@@ er@@ - and with a living @-@ made patient . &quot;
careful and repeat@@ ed@@ ed controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mir@@ rors are recommended during the first two weeks after the transpl@@ ant under Adv@@ ent raf in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure to immediate delay phase .
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State can be achieved . &quot;
&quot; in case of the patient &apos;s condition in the first post@@ operative phase no or@@ ale intake of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment may be initiated with a dose of approx . &quot;
&quot; in the duration of the application , the supp@@ ression of tran@@ splan@@ ts must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of the or@@ ical therapy is not stated . &quot;
Dos@@ is@@ recommendations - Ni@@ er@@ un@@ spl@@ ant Pro@@ phy@@ lax@@ e of Tran@@ spl@@ ant@@ at@@ ab@@ sto@@ ung The or@@ ale Adv@@ ent therapy should start with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further dosage customiz@@ ations can be required later , as the pharmac@@ euticals of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transpl@@ ant . &quot;
Dos@@ is@@ recommendations - liver transpl@@ ant prophy@@ la@@ xis of the Tran@@ spl@@ ant@@ at@@ ab@@ sto@@ ung The or@@ ale Adv@@ ent therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage adjustment - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ent raf must be set by twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ent raf , so this shift in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , obtained in the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transpl@@ ant after a shift from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants at Adv@@ ent raf once daily the treatment must commen@@ ce in Ni@@ er@@ - and liver transpl@@ ant &apos;s initi@@ al@@ ge@@ osis for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of transpl@@ anting .
heart transpl@@ ant In adult patients who are placed on Adv@@ ent photographer is an or@@ ale Initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.7 mg / kg / day daily at once .
other tran@@ sp@@ ans shor@@ tw@@ ave Rec@@ ei@@ vers does not have clinical experience with advoc@@ acy in a oral initi@@ al@@ osis of 0.10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , at p@@ ank@@ ment planning of 0,@@ 2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal tran@@ splan@@ ts from 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day to use . &quot;
dosage customiz@@ ations in special patient @-@ specific patients with reduced liver function in order to maintain blood talented in the ground@@ ing range can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function did not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um cancer is recommended , a calculation of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ incl@@ ear@@ ance and supervision of the ure@@ volume ) . &quot;
conversion from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ent raf in the conversion of a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in@@ - to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; recommendations on the Tal@@ mir@@ rors in full @-@ scale The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of reb@@ elling and toler@@ ability in individual case , under the help of enforcement of full @-@ scale tac@@ eous levels of levels . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended by frequent controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talents during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant , followed by peri@@ odi@@ c controls during the maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ talent levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change according to conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ent raf , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at simultaneous use of substances , which could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ thorough@@ bred @-@ concentration . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ent raf is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose can require several days until the ste@@ ady state has entered . &quot;
the information in clinical trials can be concluded that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the talents in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml will not exceed .
in clinical practice the talents of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are usually in the first time after liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with and sav@@ ory patient at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent investigation therapy of liver , kidney , and cardi@@ ac @-@ tran@@ splan@@ ts were generally used blood @-@ concentration in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious unwanted events , including Tran@@ spl@@ ant@@ at@@ ables , or other side effects which can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Under@@ - or Over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; transform@@ ations of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the narro@@ wing control of one in the transpl@@ ant experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transpl@@ ant@@ ab@@ ians that proved to be proven to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants as therapy has not yet been a clinical data for the rede@@ em@@ ing formulation .
the prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant dro@@ pping in adult cardi@@ ac recei@@ vers and transpl@@ ant recei@@ vers are not yet another clinical data for the rede@@ em@@ ing formulation Adv@@ ent .
&quot; due to possible interactions resulting in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) are included , or other plant healing during treatment with advoc@@ acy ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentr@@ ations in the blood , since the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , it was formed under Pro@@ gra@@ f as a cardi@@ omy@@ opathy , Kam@@ mer@@ - or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ y , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ent photographer . &quot;
&quot; further factors that increase the risk of such clin@@ ically disorders , are an already existing cardi@@ ac disease , hyper@@ tension , kidney @-@ pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid @-@ load and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV @-@ light should be limited because of possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin change by suitable clothing or using a solar protection by means of a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for P@@ RES like head@@ aches , modified awareness and visual dys@@ functions , should show a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ent raf Hart@@ bl@@ ackl@@ es , L@@ act@@ ose , L@@ act@@ ose , is included in patients with the rare her@@ edit@@ ary Gal@@ act@@ osis , L@@ act@@ ase deficiency or gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ de@@ act@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ or or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels at the same time of substances , which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , and to adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintenance equ@@ itable concentr@@ ations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive change has been developed with an@@ tim@@ y@@ oti@@ ka such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic belonging to ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ prot@@ ector numbers ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies took , that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , is caused by the im@@ itation of gast@@ ro@@ o@@ in@@ al failure . &quot;
&quot; lower pre@@ h@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute waste action , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be metabo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 metabo@@ lic metabolism . &quot;
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the clear@@ ing of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , and thus the hormonal exposure can increase is particularly careful in decisions about recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the results of animal welfare have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on , and to extend their semi @-@ value . &quot;
&quot; the results of a small number of exam@@ inations on transpl@@ ant patients deliver no reference to that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , a higher risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and the outcome of pregnancy . &quot;

the adren@@ al profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often be found precisely because of the underlying diseases of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; below are the adverse effects after their frequency in descending order : very frequent ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( &gt; 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not transfer@@ able ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How well @-@ known for other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is treated in patients suffering from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ ozo@@ ic ) frequently increases . &quot;
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ Associ@@ ated multi@@ fo@@ k@@ aler Leu@@ co@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients among immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ ists .

&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ uble and high bond to ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plas@@ map@@ per can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
&quot; molecular mechanism and pharmac@@ ogen@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level , the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be convey@@ ed by his bond to a cy@@ tos@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the nucle@@ us . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependen@@ cy of signal trans@@ duction due to the T @-@ cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of blood pressure in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( one by the lack of factor VIII related to inn@@ ate blood circulation ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether they are applied to the treatment of bl@@ eeding or prevention of blood charges .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII lack of blood circulation issues such as bl@@ eeding in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plas@@ ma , but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced into a gene ( DNA ) to form it to the formation of the human ger@@ mination factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate medicines called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , however , is otherwise produced , so that medicines does not contain proteins human@@ ic or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug is examined by means of prevention of blood vessels as well as surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of blood uses in 86 % of 510 new blood episodes with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; well &quot; &quot; rated &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ dle , head@@ aches , Py@@ re@@ xy ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster protein or any of the other constitu@@ ents . &quot;
March 2004 the European Commission shared the B@@ ax@@ ter AG approval for the transport of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the gravity of the factor VIII lack in accordance with the place and the extent of the bl@@ eeding and the clinical state of the patient .
in the following here@@ of hem@@ ar@@ ean events the factor VIII activity in the appropriate period is not under the given Plas@@ tics ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
inj@@ ections every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger for the patient is over .
during treatment process the treatment of inj@@ ecting dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections are inv@@ oked a proper provision of factor VIII .
&quot; individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis of prophy@@ la@@ xis of blood @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis in patients with severe chicken op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII pro kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII can not be reached or if the blood pressure is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to follow a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ escence it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions must be wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed is intended to set itself after the payment of the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atorial activity of factor VIII oriented Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plas@@ ma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; developing the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ relation with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first twenty @-@ position stage is on the largest and dependent on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exc@@ els and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al known inhibit@@ ory development was observed , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ establishment of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare appearance of the H@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there are no experience in the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the patients with the greatest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all of them were previously untreated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and s@@ win@@ dle ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( &gt; 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not transfer@@ able ) . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available on the initial phase , the CH@@ MP defines the benefit of risk - accounting continues to be positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored closely for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; hence , the CH@@ MP on the basis of the Security Council of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 month , decided that the authorisation will apply for 5 years to request further extensions . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited approved the Committee on Human@@ geons ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company accepts his request for approval for the handling of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones , or the soft parts ( tissues , the other structures associated with the body , surrounds and rel@@ ies ) thereof . &quot;
&quot; this is a type of virus that gene@@ tically modified so , that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ exin is a &quot; &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; that has changed so that there is no copies of themselves and therefore no infections in men can trigger . &quot;
advoc@@ ating could have been ma@@ iled straight into the tum@@ ors and allow cancer cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from that not broken in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , carries normally transm@@ uted to the recovery of corrupt DNA and to killing the cells when the DNA may not be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , with which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and split . &quot;
&quot; the company placed data from a study involving one patient , at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of the sub@@ tree , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had tested the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions uns@@ ol@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial documentation provided the CH@@ MP to day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ antage in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors will bring benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns concerning the processing of the medicine by means of the body , the type of administration , and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advoc@@ acy can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come into close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company made the CH@@ MP not aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients has currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ exin . &quot;
changing the drug @-@ release &quot; means that the tablets are so mer@@ ged that one of the effective components immediately and the other is slowly released over several hours .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is applied for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis ( h@@ ay @-@ sn@@ ap by an allergy to poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al @-@ in@@ consisten@@ cies ( pet@@ ri@@ fied nose ) .
in adults and young people older than 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ blast@@ ina ( pet@@ ri@@ fied nose ) . &quot;
a treatment of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be dimin@@ ished by the p@@ ending of the nose .
the main effective dimensions were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the hay@@ loft symptoms which were reported by the patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study the patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary , and reviewed with a standard sk@@ ala , how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in viewing of all h@@ ay @-@ sn@@ acking symptoms , besides the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , compared with 35,@@ 9 % compared with the patients , the pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone took . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nose @-@ sl@@ ender was regarded , patients showed among aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze an all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms around 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to the patient , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( heart hunting ) , but@@ ton@@ ic , psych@@ otrop@@ ic , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nie ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sle@@ e@@ ence ) , sleeping @-@ disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other constitu@@ ents , against the conci@@ erge agents or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( a different drug for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must also not be applied to patients who suffer from a bott@@ len@@ angle glau@@ coma ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( hyper@@ tension caused by brain blood ) , or have a risk for hem@@ orrho@@ id stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission shared a permit for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to sw@@ allow the whole ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ush , to break or throw ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data ( see Section 5.1 ) in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use of 10 days , since long @-@ term application the activity of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease in time . &quot;
&quot; after decline in the swelling of the v@@ eils in the upper breath , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the drug is also con@@ trained in patients who are treated with a monopol@@ y oxid@@ ant ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ et@@ etic activity in combined use of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ ide , ery@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc. ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient work , and the data is not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations for dosage . &quot;
security and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested with patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data is not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about the treatment at the appearance of a hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic or of Pal@@ aces , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients suffering from Digital@@ is • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ess in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bub@@ bles , or bronze sculpture in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to carrying out of dermat@@ ological testing , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin transactions or to reduce it in their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical tests with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered , however , have been observed no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the Plas@@ on@@ cent@@ ric of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psychological testing , no significant differences could be observed between the patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo independently of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; responsible for the met@@ abol@@ ism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin @-@ responsible enzy@@ me has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not inhi@@ bited in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the invali@@ dity of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproduction studies of animals are not always transmitted to humans , and on the basis of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ ical properties of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be used aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should however be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it , that in very rare cases it may come to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or the ability to remedy machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dition , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , heart @-@ circulation systems ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ation , cur@@ l , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; head@@ aches , anxiety , complicated mic@@ rot@@ ary , mus@@ cular and increased muscle tension , eu@@ v@@ ital@@ ism , cardi@@ ac , nau@@ sea , sof@@ ten@@ ess , t@@ int@@ ment , t@@ int@@ ment , t@@ innitus , At@@ trac@@ ie , visual dys@@ functions and hyper@@ ton@@ ie , or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ n@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , p@@ up@@ oli rigi@@ d , and - di@@ lat@@ ation , door@@ step , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ o@@ in@@ ale symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ men@@ or@@ ical cycles , such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from Human Ma@@ st@@ ables / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , and the im@@ itation of the expression of the adol@@ escence P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; with an individual dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening of subjective mud or tasks which are connected to the traps . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials was found at the recommended dosage of 5 mg every day no increased frequency of sl@@ ing compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the oral application of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can give further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; we received 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis , whereby 4@@ 14 patients were Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determines the effect of the overall cor@@ es for symptoms ( except nose @-@ sl@@ ating skin ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the fluctu@@ ating effect , determined by the nose @-@ sl@@ ing skin , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
as part of a single dose study on Pharmac@@ euticals from Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin within 30 minutes after administration in Plas@@ ma .
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy trial , over 14 days , the flow of weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseudo @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can be reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ professional stu@@ ff@@ ed , which was performed with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult rehear@@ sals , has been noted that four promot@@ ers Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was badly affected . &quot;
&quot; one component inter@@ viewer shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , according to the sole gift of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ ä@@ qui@@ um , was the exposure to the gift of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeti@@ tive gases and to reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is however no special dangers for the human being . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive medicine , the combination of the Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and at rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic . &quot;

&quot; when allergic Rhin@@ i@@ tis led , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg ast@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of the symptom ( symptoms scores ) around 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % with patients to be treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin , or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission shared the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , for all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms in allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist Rhin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience of clinical trials for the effectiveness in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin for young adults from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ sti@@ cally allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be completed according to the previous disease process and can be ended after the end of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed at their re@@ occur .
&quot; in the pers@@ ist allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( appearance of symptoms , 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the aller@@ genic time . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been observed in the context of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered ( see below 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , an simultaneous intake of as@@ eri@@ us and alcohol is not enhanced ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should however be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it , that in very rare cases it may come to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to serve machinery . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most commonly used side effects , reported on the more common than at plac@@ ebo , fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0,8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0,@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ effect head@@ aches were treated at 5,@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and at 6.4 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ specialist study , administ@@ ered by up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ eri@@ or clinical dose ) have been observed no clin@@ ically relevant effects . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ men@@ or@@ ical Zy@@ to@@ k@@ ins such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from Human Ma@@ st@@ ables / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , and the im@@ itation of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multi @-@ specialist , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has been administ@@ ered in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) has been administ@@ ered over ten days , showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ viewer . &quot;
&quot; with an individual dos@@ is@@ - study with adults showed des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective mud or tasks which are connected to the traps . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching flow and redness of eyes as well as itch on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively in inter@@ mitt@@ ent Rhin@@ i@@ tis and Persian Rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
Persian rhin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the appearance of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as on the basis of the total cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aires of life on Rhin@@ o @-@ economic vi@@ tis was shown , dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us effectively caused by seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis caused by seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
the chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as the underlying path@@ ology irrespective of the e@@ ology in different forms and chronic patients may be easier to rec@@ ede .
&quot; since the hist@@ ological inf@@ ect is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin will also lead to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic urine was A@@ eri@@ us effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of the patients , who did not appear on Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the itch to more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin patients compared to 19 % of patients with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate this variable . &quot;
&quot; in a phar@@ a@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis population , was achieved with 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no cl@@ ue to clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , responsible for the met@@ abol@@ ism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin @-@ responsible enzy@@ me has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines will not be completely ruled out . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bited in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ stu@@ d with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7.5 mg most of the meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie good breakfast ) does not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the clinical trials performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin , in a comparable degree of exposure to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , not qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeti@@ tive genes , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin have no special dangers for man . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist Rhin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ i@@ tis can be caused by children under 2 years ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are subject to support a inf@@ ective rhin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ alies should play a role in diagnos@@ ing the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , bodily investigation and corresponding laboratory studies . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabo@@ lic Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin are limited and experienced a higher sub@@ ordinate load ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , the restricted metabo@@ li@@ zation , is identical to the children who are normally metabo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ g@@ act@@ ment or a Sac@@ char@@ ase inhibit@@ or in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been observed in the context of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered ( see below 5.1 ) . &quot;
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced with an simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side @-@ effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as with the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ specialist study on adults and young people , administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) have been observed no clin@@ ically relevant effects . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years who were asked for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy from 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic Rhin@@ i@@ tis / chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is similar to adults and children , can be extrac@@ ted the active data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin for adults on the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical trial with multiple log@@ oses in adults and young people , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days was not described statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and young people , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials was found at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and young people no increased frequency of sl@@ ing compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; with an individual @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and young people in clinical studies have no impair@@ ment of Psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies on adults , it was neither the simultaneous intake of alcohol either to increase the alcohol in@@ duced performance , nor an increase in free@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ en@@ ary and redness of eyes as well as itch on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
as on the basis of the total cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aires of life on Rhin@@ o @-@ economic vi@@ tis was shown to dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively caused by seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic urine was A@@ eri@@ us effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; the spread of this restricted metabo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ professional study with sy@@ up@@ form@@ ulating children between 2 and 11 years of allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis who are limited to limited metabo@@ li@@ zation .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was higher after 3 to 6 hours approximately 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a termin@@ ous half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no cl@@ ue for a clin@@ ically relevant substance identification after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and young people .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was comparable with those recommended cans with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin @-@ sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
&quot; however , responsible for the met@@ abol@@ ism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin @-@ responsible enzy@@ me has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;

&quot; June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company accepts his request for approval for the transfer of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for the protection against flu which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza @-@ A virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine , which could cause a trunk of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of the flu virus emerg@@ es , which can easily spread from human to humans , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognise the immune system in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; &quot; and forms the antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; thus , the immune system will later be able to form in contact with a flu virus that make up a faster anti@@ body . &quot;
subsequently the membrane ke@@ eper of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that det@@ ects the human body as a body @-@ alien ) and used as an integral part of the vaccine .
&quot; a inspection of some of the study programmes showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for pan@@ de@@ mic vaccines . &quot;
should you take part in a clinical examination and require further information on your treatment please contact your treatment doctor .
&quot; if you wish to receive further information about the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years of being infected with the human@@ ized immun@@ isation of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired Imm@@ une Def@@ iciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
&quot; for patients who cannot sw@@ allow the capsules , as a solution can not be taken as a solution , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the security of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be en@@ acted when the doctor has tested , which anti @-@ viral medicines has previously taken , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood is that the virus is attached to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which will be taken twice daily with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and 12 years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is directed after body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV amount of blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus delay the development of with AIDS related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adult who had previously not been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; that was taken with low do@@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicines A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults , which compared earlier prot@@ eas@@ ers , compared with other prototype numbers . &quot;
the main index of the patient &apos;s effect was the proportion of patients with not veri@@ fiable concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( viral burden ) or the change in the vir@@ us@@ last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ eas@@ ant more than 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , having less than 400 copies / ml than below plac@@ ebo , but an@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the Vir@@ v@@ last , however , with the children who were treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ers , only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving adults , which were treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ers , which were treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicines A@@ gener@@ ase , the viral burden after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prototype systems &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from HIV , which was against four other prot@@ eas@@ ants resist@@ ent resistance , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase , with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the viral burden after four weeks as with the patients who continued their hitherto prototype . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ generic ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash , rash and Ill@@ nesses ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ generic must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase must also not be applied to patients , the cur@@ rants ( a herbal medication used to treat depression ) or medicines that are just like A@@ gener@@ ase , and are in high concentr@@ ations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other drugs against HIV , the A@@ gener@@ ase is taking into account the risk of a li@@ pi@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of body tissues ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( pul@@ ling of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection , which caused by the recovered immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ geons ( CH@@ MP ) aimed at the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the phar@@ a@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee stated that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase was taken in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had no prot@@ eas@@ eless@@ ly , not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally authorised under &quot; exceptional circumstances , as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission shared the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for approval for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ eas@@ eless@@ mer ( PI ) and children older than 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ generic capsules for pharmac@@ ogen@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting can be administ@@ ered together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral Resi@@ denti@@ al and the Pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % less than by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ change@@ able ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 . if A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fying supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) must be applied higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ er@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines by up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants have not been studied in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic is not recommended for the application in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on in@@ conceivable and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ist data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules at adult patients with moderate @-@ severe liver dys@@ functionality on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be made with caution in patients with mild or reduced liver functioning , in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions , it is contr@@ ain@@ dicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with drugs which have a low therapeutic width , and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ cyclop@@ ge 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations to contain the cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plastic centr@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C , and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have a higher risk of severe liver medicine with potentially fatal course . &quot;
&quot; for the event of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the specialized information of these medicines . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis indicate an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ tic@@ ine or other gluten @-@ stero@@ ids that is not recommended for CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended that the possible benefits of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ne@@ id effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Stock@@ ression of secondary function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ su@@ atin strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is an equivalent administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ su@@ atin because of the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
&quot; 4 For some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ised Rati@@ o ) , methods are available for the determination of the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to decreased plas@@ mas@@ mas@@ r less effective ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabo@@ lic interactions with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be controlled on op@@ i@@ at@@ ch@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ ylene of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ ylene solution , this formulation is contr@@ ain@@ dicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient @-@ groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic should be placed on duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the lo@@ ops are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ers , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ alt@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases resulting in their therapy drugs which are associated with the development of a diabetes or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical in@@ dependen@@ cies , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
&quot; with h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ector numbers , reports of an increase of blood vessels including spontaneous coma and her@@ mar@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
at HIV infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective may develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or res@@ du@@ ale opportun@@ istic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial fields is adopted ( including the use of cor@@ tical stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immune supp@@ ression , higher body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with lower therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ al@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ cyclop@@ ge 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width ap@@ hr@@ ase must not be combined with medicinal products whose active ingredients are mainly connected via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with weight@@ ing and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is causing a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a Resi@@ denti@@ al development .
&quot; with the attempt to compens@@ ate the low plas@@ mas@@ onry by a dosage increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very often unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient takes a cur@@ rant , the am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r@@ spiegel and when possible , to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and ab@@ ide the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence below ) .
5@@ 08 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % reduced if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
in clinical trials included doses of 600 mg am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily which are the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this treatment schem@@ atics .
52 % reduced if Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
&quot; the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in plas@@ ma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is given twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dose of dose for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but there is however a narro@@ wer surveillance , since the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this combination is unknown . &quot;
&quot; there was no phar@@ a@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the anta@@ cides component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz is required in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other Prot@@ eas@@ ants and existing limited data susp@@ ect that Ne@@ viral may be fl@@ ashing into the Ser@@ um@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be utilized at the same time , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din due to the decreased / possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ mas@@ onry could be less effective . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision should be made , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to be turned down to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in Plas@@ on@@ cent@@ ric ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to a rise of associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin effects .
&quot; when it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin may be administ@@ ered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however the plas@@ mas@@ onry of both drugs could be increased in the case of con@@ current administration . &quot;
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day led to an increase in C@@ max from K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in the plas@@ ma at 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be related to toxic responses , which are associated with these drugs , if they are being applied in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ ers , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it can occur to res@@ or@@ atory disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti @-@ volcan@@ si@@ va known as enzy@@ mes ( Phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degrad@@ ation of the plas@@ mas@@ onry of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium blocks such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ gh@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin ,
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase , their plastic concentration can increase considerably and increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days in trial period , the Flu@@ gene cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % reduction of 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended with these gl@@ uc@@ ose veins , unless the possible benefits of a treatment weighs the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ne@@ id effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ su@@ atin , their reproduction is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the increases of Plas@@ tics co@@ ols are expected to be expected of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plas@@ mas@@ se@@ aling increases of this H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these medicines with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it will be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentr@@ ations up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , since the plas@@ ma centr@@ ations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ generic is not being applied together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data on the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other Prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible rise in Plas@@ tics from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to get 3 @-@ 4 times .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be controlled on op@@ i@@ at@@ ched symptoms . especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the per se of low distor@@ tion of historical compar@@ isons , at present no recommendation is given any recommendation , such as the Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to adapt when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time . &quot;
&quot; at simultaneous presence of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ istic antibodies together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ised Rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of anti @-@ bot@@ tom@@ atic effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contr@@ az@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a is not predicted , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side @-@ effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of the potential commercial for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .

the further development of the descendants including Fer@@ til@@ ity and Re@@ production capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r to the mat@@ tier .
the in@@ adequ@@ acy of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most associated with the A@@ generic treatments associated side effects were slightly up to moderate , occurred early and led rarely to treatment . &quot;
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clear whether in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other at the same time , HIV medicine may be used , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which with prot@@ eas@@ ers did not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were referred to by the investig@@ ator as described in connection with the study drug , and were performed for more than 1 % of patients , as well as under the treatment applicable laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of periph@@ ery and fa@@ wn hot @-@ skin tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ y of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ k@@ al fat collection ( styles ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ fitting not previously untreated persons , which were treated with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ in over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was observed only a case ( st@@ aking ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 played with 245 NR@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with different NR@@ TI@@ s over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were particularly reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
for HIV infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective may develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or res@@ du@@ ale opportun@@ istic infections .

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 4 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in human beings is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages have been observed - like other k@@ ra@@ viol@@ r treatment system - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .

&quot; a otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 of 14 children , with which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure did not appear within the 59 , with prot@@ eas@@ ants did not pre @-@ treated patients , showed Resi@@ sten@@ z@@ m@@ uster which were similar to those in adults . &quot;

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ ho@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : N = 107 ) to patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure to say about 96 weeks , the following prot@@ eas@@ eless mut@@ ations on : &quot;
on the otyp@@ ic resistance @-@ based analysis of gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be applied to the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant insul@@ ators .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines Resi@@ st@@ enz as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I , M@@ 36@@ A / L / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 8@@ A / L / L / G , I@@ 84@@ V , and a decreased lik@@ eli@@ hood of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always approach the current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems for analysis of the results of Resi@@ stance testing . &quot;
based on phenomen@@ al resistance @-@ based analyses clin@@ ically vali@@ dated ph@@ oph@@ onic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant insul@@ ators .
&quot; companies , the diagnostic Resi@@ stance testing , have developed clinical @-@ ph@@ oph@@ ical C@@ ut @-@ off@@ s ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a Resi@@ stance testing . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r associated gene@@ tics patterns creates a certain cru@@ pul@@ ley against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ av@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r , but generally preserved . &quot;
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and other Prot@@ eas@@ ers for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r Resi@@ sten@@ z@@ pf@@ ade either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
&quot; on the basis of five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ fitting ( three of 25 insul@@ ators ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ators ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ators ) , in@@ dem@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant insul@@ ators in ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isolation . &quot;
the early break@@ down of a reconc@@ iling therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders that may affect the following treatment .
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of as@@ er@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI treatment ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kl@@ e@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( NR@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , mainly received with a low @-@ si@@ pped k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ term tri@@ angles ( n = 163 ) patients with proven Virus @-@ sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one NR@@ TI were included in the sub@@ stage A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ under@@ carriage of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ judicial modification of the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plas@@ ma after 16 weeks , in a non @-@ recur@@ ring wave of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ adul@@ ter@@ ated A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged between 2 and 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies A@@ generic solution for cap@@ turing and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
no low do@@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of the patients affected patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NT@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of included in the study included a Plas@@ ma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml at a medi@@ ans increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Basi@@ lic@@ ting to this data should be considered during the therapy optim@@ isation , with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ adul@@ ter@@ ated &quot; A@@ generic &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to maximum Ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
5@@ 08 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) along with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
the administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % of charge of AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r 12 hours to dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; therefore the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous intake of the scale and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption influenced . &quot;
the seem@@ ing volume volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be extended to a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the drug in the plas@@ ma , with the amount of uncomfortable am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ ending Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of free active component in dependence on the overall drug @-@ concentration in the ste@@ ady @-@ State via the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bited or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution given , if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg each day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ degrad@@ able than from the capsules ; hence A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ generic capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able on a milli@@ gram@@ ming base .
&quot; the ren@@ al clear@@ ness of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected , therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be minor on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ eg@@ eln comparable those that are obtained in healthy rehear@@ sals after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on can@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y with mice and rats , at male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ oms at dos@@ ages , which stood to the 2,@@ 0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ oms aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ ome has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present evidence data on the human being , both of clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , had little evidence for accepting a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity testing , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , micro@@ kern@@ els of rats and Chro@@ mos@@ omen@@ ab@@ err@@ ation@@ est at human periph@@ eral and chromos@@ omes , was neither coll@@ agen nor mess@@ y . &quot;
&quot; this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical everyday life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; so far in clinical studies have not observed no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during administration of as@@ er@@ ase nor after the end of treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on the tox@@ icity of juven@@ iles at young age , which were treated at the age of 4 days and were treated as high mor@@ ality as well as with the am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r animals . &quot;
&quot; in a system@@ ic plas@@ ma exposure , which was significant under ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage , were observed , however , a number of low @-@ scale changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and low @-@ depth skel@@ eton are observed , which refer to a del@@ ayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules can be applied without the ampli@@ fying supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses should be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for as@@ er@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines by up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be made with caution in patients with severe or lighter liver disorder , in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions , it is contr@@ ain@@ dicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ised Rati@@ o ) , methods are available for the determination of the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic should be set on duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the lo@@ ops are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; a higher risk for a li@@ d@@ yst@@ roph@@ y has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with pharmaceutical in@@ dependen@@ cies , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is causing a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a Resi@@ denti@@ al development .
5@@ 08 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % reduced if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
&quot; the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in plas@@ ma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is given twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dose of dose for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but there is however a narro@@ wer surveillance , since the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this combination is unknown . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would be low .
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision should be made , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to be turned down to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din . &quot;
&quot; when it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin may be administ@@ ered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data . &quot;

&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days in trial period , the Flu@@ gene cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % reduction of 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; at simultaneous presence of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ istic antibodies together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ised Rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of anti @-@ bot@@ tom@@ atic effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl es@@ tradi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of the potential commercial for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction stu@@ ff@@ ness that was administ@@ ered by in@@ ni@@ st@@ ung in the U@@ ter@@ us until the end of stagn@@ ation of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r was demonstrated during the lac@@ tation period showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the post@@ age .

&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is at signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) , if necessary , are necessary support action . &quot;
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood @-@ cylin@@ ders . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 4 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0,50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant insul@@ ators in ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isolation . &quot;
&quot; based on this data should be considered in therapy optim@@ isation , with PI pre @-@ treated children who are considered to be expected to be considered un@@ planned . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ ending Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of free active component in dependence on the overall drug @-@ concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State via the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bited or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution given , if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the ren@@ al clear@@ ing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected ; therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be minor on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on can@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y with mice and rats , at male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ oms at dos@@ ages , containing 2,@@ 0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ ome has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present evidence data on the human being , both of clinical trials and therapeutic applications , however , had little evidence for accepting a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity testing , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , micro@@ kern@@ els of rats and Chro@@ mos@@ omen@@ ab@@ err@@ ation@@ est at human periph@@ eral and chromos@@ omes , was neither coll@@ agen nor mess@@ y . &quot;
&quot; studies on the tox@@ icity of juven@@ iles at young age , which were treated at the age of 4 days and were treated as high mor@@ ality as well as with the am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r animals . &quot;
&quot; these results make sure that in chic@@ ks the met@@ abol@@ ism are not fully mature , so that Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic solution for inclusion is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ eas@@ eless@@ mer ( PI ) and children older than 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution &quot; &quot; has neither been treated with PI pre@@ treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % less than by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ change@@ able ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to sw@@ allow the capsules with taking the solution to the inv@@ aders ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic solution is 17 mg ( 1,@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines by 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there does not have to be a dosage for the simultaneous use of as@@ er@@ ase solution to inv@@ ading and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided this combination with these patients . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment is not necessary for Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , is an application of A@@ generic solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of an toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ ylene gly@@ cos@@ al , A@@ gener@@ ase is a result of inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver fail and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration can lead to a funny inhi@@ bit of the met@@ abol@@ ism of these medicines and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy leads to a cure of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 a transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ised Rati@@ o ) , methods are available for the determination of the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic should be set upon duration if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the lo@@ ops are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; a higher risk for a li@@ d@@ yst@@ roph@@ y has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with pharmaceutical medium of 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
&quot; with h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ector numbers , reports of an increase of blood vessels including spontaneous coma and her@@ mar@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is causing a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a Resi@@ denti@@ al development .
5@@ 08 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % reduced if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
&quot; simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase , their plastic concentration can increase considerably and increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;

the in@@ adequ@@ acy of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clear whether in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other at the same time , HIV medicine may be used , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages have been observed - like other k@@ ra@@ viol@@ r treatment system - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .

&quot; in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dara has been tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; main indi@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete waste treatment . • Al@@ dara has also been studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell cardi@@ ac disease in two studies , where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dara or the plac@@ ebo either daily or five times weekly . &quot;

&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ ori@@ y@@ ance was carried out , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis and one case were observed with one of the circum@@ c@@ ision . &quot;
&quot; in case of an application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od creams in higher than the recommended cans , there is an increased risk of heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) in rare cases were also observed under fac@@ tu@@ ally application , which made a treatment necessary and / or to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occur at the exit of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine , which required a emergency relief and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the use of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ am immediately following an treatment with other k@@ ut@@ an appli@@ ed funds for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in genital and periph@@ eral area , there are no clinical experience before . &quot;

&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair attachment was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local home actions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions to completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od creams . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary because of the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin actions , a treatment plan can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin after 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , should be considered at super@@ vis@@ ually Bas@@ al@@ omas and other suitable therapy forms . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ C@@ s , there are no clinical experience before , hence the application is not recommended to pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial point out that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lesser lik@@ eli@@ hood of response to the I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ess cor@@ at@@ osis on ey@@ eli@@ ds in the inner of the nose or the ears or on the lip of the lip@@ tic cl@@ ots .
there are only very limited data about the use of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for the treatment of acoustic ker@@ at@@ ants in anatom@@ ical spots outside the face and the sc@@ alp .
&quot; the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ ess Ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower and hands support the effectiveness in this use of use , so such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local home interactions often appear on but these reactions usually take back in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od creams .
&quot; if the local skin transactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment can be exposed to some days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - L@@ ä@@ s have shown a less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ om@@ izes properties , I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;

the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od during five @-@ day application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; the target tumor were hist@@ ological confirmed single primary super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell , with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm . &quot;
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of this data show that about 7@@ 9.3 % ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated clin@@ ically , and that were also 48 months long . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od at three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was tested in two double blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;

the three @-@ year data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show patients with clin@@ ically cooling after one or two treatment periods of a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications of external f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ess ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cells usually do not occur and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dara Cre@@ am has been studied in four random@@ ized , double blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;

the obvious half @-@ value term was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ value after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a former study ; this indicates a prolonged re@@ tention of the medication by means in the skin .
the data for the system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od was low to top@@ ical application of patients aged 6 - 12 years and comparable with that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ess ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ ins .
in a four @-@ month study for der@@ mal tox@@ icity in the rat @-@ led cans of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG to significantly reduced body weight and increased milk weight ; one also four months long @-@ guided study referred to the mouse no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice with mice in three days a week in@@ duced no tum@@ ors on the application .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od is only a small system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ ing , is a risk to the human being due to the system@@ ic exposure as very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors came in the group of mice , treated with the effective cream , used earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with little U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the security of the drug was examined , however , it was also measured its effectiveness ( by having examined its effect in terms of reducing the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me die G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine of about 60 % , and half of the children treated at the end of the study pointed out a normal liver . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain rash , pain rash , pain in the limb@@ s , pain , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion place . &quot;

June 2003 the European Commission shared the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of Chinese Ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is designed for long @-@ time enzy@@ me treatment in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabo@@ lic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be if the patient is toler@@ ated all 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum @-@ dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme can be recommended . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined , and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme can be recommended . &quot;
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treatment patients may develop inf@@ usion @-@ conditioned reactions , which are defined as any related effect , which occurs during inf@@ usion or up to the end of the inf@@ usion of the inf@@ usion ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be monitored carefully and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment in the re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation facility for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of a inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution in use of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as little experience relating to the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , must be cau@@ tioned due to the theoretically increased risk @-@ reaction after a break of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minimize the potential @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of light or medium @-@ severe inf@@ usion , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate at half of the inf@@ usion rate , where the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion @-@ borne reaction , the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti @-@ hist@@ amine and acet@@ amin@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to consider . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rates on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate where the reaction occurred to be resum@@ ed .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rates on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate where the predicted reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is .
&quot; experimental studies cannot be transferred directly or indirect effect on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ ale development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data to new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , while the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not silent . &quot;
side effects in clinical studies have been arranged mainly as inf@@ usion @-@ conditioned reactions to 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment of up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years of age ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
&quot; unwanted remedies related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during phase 3 years or older at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment period of up to 4 years , are usually ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) ; often ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ condi@@ tional participation of the upper respir@@ atory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , there were heavy reactions , including bronze , respir@@ atory and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children &apos;s disease impacts related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with mainly severe dis@@ continued form and treatment of up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg of intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , the treatment occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a ser@@ tation version , whereby the patients aged under 5 years along with a severe dis@@ continued form ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to an un@@ timely discharge from the study ) , with 13 / 45 patients none by radio@@ immun@@ otherap@@ ists ( Rip ) As@@ say det@@ ectable si@@ RNA before , including 3 patients , in which it has never been to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ versions . &quot;
&quot; patients with fl@@ amm@@ ite up to lower antibodies in the Har@@ n in Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti @-@ antibodies , a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n was to determine . &quot;
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to not inter@@ fere with clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of unwanted drugs , even though the appearance of undes@@ irable remedies , typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the ration@@ ale for the enzy@@ me is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the ak@@ um@@ ulated sub@@ str@@ ate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate recovery of the enzy@@ mes .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous Inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into the ly@@ ric disease , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ orous recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investigated in a random@@ ized , double blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were rec@@ ited to the study , the majority of the patients were reported from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient pointed the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients have been recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ zed exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance of 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients treated against the plac@@ ebo group improving the lung function and the in@@ ability which are shown in the following table .
&quot; in an open renewal study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as seen from the following table . &quot;
the withdrawal of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung @-@ vol@@ um@@ ina increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
&quot; of 26 patients with an hep@@ at@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study , a normal living size . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a significant waste of the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was established until the study was constant .
&quot; with regard to the heter@@ ogen@@ eous path@@ ogen@@ s of the patient , the clin@@ ically significant changes takes into account , the clin@@ ically significant changes in cross @-@ minute process , a change in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ round phase @-@ 2 study was conducted in which primarily the security and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were examined by Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the heavy supply form and 4 with the medium print form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased because of increased G@@ AG@@ - Spiegel in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks at 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; with several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight increase ( n = 3 ) stated after the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and every 4 patients with the mean load form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and every 4 patients with severe dis@@ continued form , whereas no progress made in cognitive development were reported limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
in a Phase 4 study studies of pharmac@@ ogen@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me d@@ osing met@@ ad@@ ata have been carried out at the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the Leb@@ er@@ volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg of intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; dos@@ ed scheme with 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may have in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , a reasonable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two met@@ ering schem@@ ata is equal . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;

&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had never received any chemotherapy against their disease before . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ single lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) and in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had not received any chemotherapy for lung cancer .
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin were passed on average 12,@@ 1 months , compared with 9,@@ 3 months in the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received an chemotherapy , the average over@@ life time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7,@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , patients suffering from cancer are not the record epith@@ eli@@ um cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival rates than with the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission shared the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Ne@@ derland B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each one @-@ p@@ ouch has to be upgraded with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % less @-@ chl@@ ori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) - which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the appropriate volume of the necessary do@@ - S@@ IS will be taken from the entry bag and with 0.@@ 9 % less chl@@ ori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml more dil@@ uted ( see Section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin displayed for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ smart bron@@ chi@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is displayed for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administ@@ ered as intraven@@ ous Inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ sensitive bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after pre @-@ mentioned chemotherapy is the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F ranges as intraven@@ ous Inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin actions , the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ tical Arkan@@ oid . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days prior to the first dose , must be taken at least 5 doses of fol@@ ate and the intake must be continued during the entire therap@@ ists and for more 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third place of payment .
&quot; in patients who obtain P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , should be created before each gift created a full blood picture - including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ lic En@@ umer@@ ation . &quot;
the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anine Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dosage balance must take place under the rec@@ kl@@ ess of the n@@ adi@@ rs of blood pressure or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the predicted therapy cycles .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated accordingly to the instructions in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are treated to AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common toxic C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC ) &gt; C@@ CI 1998 ) &gt; C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
&quot; should patients not become hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity &gt; degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , must be interrupted therapy with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value in front of treatment
&quot; the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be cancelled , if in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ cop@@ es , a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , or not @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort at the appearance of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity . &quot;
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 year@@ - or more in comparison to patients aged 65 years of age a higher risk @-@ effective risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for the application in children under the age of 18 due to not sufficient data on in@@ conceivable and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials included in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of &gt; 45 ml / min no tin customiz@@ ations necessary , which go beyond the dosage recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data base in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver syn@@ dic@@ ation of &gt; the 1,5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - Grenz@@ wer@@ tes and / or Tran@@ sam@@ pipe extr@@ usion ( near Leb@@ er@@ metastatic breast ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metastatic ) not specifically examined in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be administ@@ ered by patients with regard to bone mar@@ ils , and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ y number is given a value of &gt; 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ ism - cy@@ tic number has achieved a value of &gt; 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
a dosage reduction for more cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ y number and maxim@@ ally non @-@ ugly tox@@ icity in which they are observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ inflammatory tox@@ icity like ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie has been considered if a pre @-@ treatment with fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; therefore , all patients need to be dependent on patients , fol@@ ate acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce the reduction of tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium @-@ lev@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy the treatment of therapy and min@@ de@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which treatment is provided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time value for at least 5 days before therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existence hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid @-@ collection in trans@@ cellular space a dra@@ inage of the result before the pun@@ ctu@@ ation treatment will be wo@@ unded .
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ers , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , when this substance is usually administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated Leben@@ shilfe ( except yellow @-@ fever , this vaccine is contr@@ ain@@ dicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible sk@@ ull consists of reproductive capacity through P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out of treatment - will be advised to obtain advice regarding the sperm count . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid in high dosage ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) to a decreased number of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable if in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or Ac@@ ic@@ yl@@ etic acid in high doses . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , in the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long semi @-@ value , such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application must be avoided at least 5 days prior to therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual variation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral antibodies and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International normal @-@ ised Rati@@ o ) when the decision was made to treat the patients with oral antibodies .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed near pregnant , but as in an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected on an application in pregnancy severe birth defects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessarily , and after careful consideration of the user for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of a irre@@ ver@@ sible sk@@ ull exists by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment start , advice regarding sperm @-@ servi@@ cies . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects with breast@@ feeding can not be ruled out .

&quot; AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate that carries out its effect by using wich@@ es fol@@ dable metabo@@ lic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients described in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the clinical @-@ relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ig@@ nen Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om was shown on the application of Lun@@ - gen@@ cancer symptom@@ atic sk@@ ala in AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the all@@ some cis@@ pl@@ a- T@@ in @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment columns can be improved by an improvement in the lung parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and an understanding of the lung function in the course of time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi @-@ cent@@ ric , random@@ ized , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el at patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy reg@@ ained patients ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 283 ) and from 7,@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;

in a third study All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 overweight people with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of &gt; 28 kg / m2 had patients , the All@@ i 60 mg , after one year record average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2,@@ 3 kg in taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients with a BM@@ I . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are cel@@ eted st@@ ains at the after , fle@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ ff@@ led , j@@ h@@ ld@@ ings , fet@@ al / ö@@ bri@@ g@@ gy ( f@@ eces ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( Win@@ de ) and soft chairs . &quot;

&quot; it may not be applied to patients suffering from a long @-@ term calendar syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are taken from the diges@@ tive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver disease ) , and with pregnant or nursing mothers . &quot;
July 2007 the European Commission shared the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for approval for the transport of Or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is used for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I &gt; 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ or@@ ical or fet@@ ched diet .
&quot; all@@ i should not be applied by children and young people under 18 , since there is not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since the list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ bi@@ ert , is for aging and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adaptation of the dosage necessary . &quot;
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredients or any of the other components • simultaneous treatment with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chron@@ icle Mal@@ absor@@ bing syndrome • breast@@ feeding ( see section 4.6 ) • simultaneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen antibodies ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of the appearance of gast@@ ro@@ o@@ in@@ aler symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i will be taken along with a fat or fat diet .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes , with an improved metabo@@ lic control , patients should take a drug against diabetes , in the beginning of a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist consult because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic needs must be adjusted . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage needs to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating policies , in order to bend in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on interaction of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of Or@@ list@@ at and Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in was observed an ab@@ yss of the Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in @-@ Plas@@ tics .
&quot; in combination of war@@ far@@ in or other oral antibodies in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Values could be influenced ( internationally normal Rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients were treated with oral studies up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentr@@ ations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the standard range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patients should be recommended to form@@ ulate a supplement of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure an adequate vit@@ amine intake ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of an on@@ mal@@ d@@ osis A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed at a limited number of un@@ healthy volunteers , which at the same time were observed at the same plac@@ list@@ at , a reduced decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ ale development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ in@@ al nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
gast@@ ro@@ un@@ inal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not transfer@@ able ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the known side effects that were determined by the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were told voluntarily on a population of un@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to impair@@ ment in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ un@@ inal side effects .
individual doses of 800 mg of Or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ specialist from up to 400 mg three times daily were administ@@ ered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight people without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of the cases reported by Or@@ list@@ at &apos;s transform@@ ations , there were either no side effects or similar side effects as in the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals can be trac@@ ed from a fast back@@ formation of a system@@ ic effects based on the li@@ pas@@ ative properties of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;

&quot; clinical trials was derived , that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , blocked three times daily , absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ al . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I &gt; 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ cris@@ y , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of random ) , has been evaluated as follows : as a change of body weight in the degree program ( table 1 ) and as a share of those study participants , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of its output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction of 12 months was observed , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
&quot; the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.7 % ( output worth 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
the average change of the L@@ DL cholesterol was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output current m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the powerful trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ ere , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of an Corti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug which can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
the application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as to the effects contained in this age group not enough information .
&quot; this means that the ingredient of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
Alo@@ xi has been studied in three main studies to 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies which have strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are 59 % of patients who treated with alo@@ xi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate payout for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are , 81 % of the patients were treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no v@@ om@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission shared the company Helsinki n Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a licence for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent ak@@ ud@@ ity and v@@ om@@ iting with strong em@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy due to cancer disease and for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with moderate em@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy based on cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi on the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting that is indu@@ ces by a strongly em@@ ic chemotherapy is reinforced by adding a cor@@ rupted cor@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the Dick@@ dar@@ mp@@ ass@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ li@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ trac@@ ting I@@ le@@ us after the inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; however , with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable when using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicinal drugs that extend the Q@@ T @-@ Inter@@ v@@ all or in patients with which the Q@@ t- Inter@@ v@@ all is prolonged , or which tend to be one of such extension . &quot;
&quot; apart from connection with a further chemotherapy medication , Alo@@ xi in the days after chemotherapy was neither to prevention nor used to treat nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron does not examined the tum@@ ours of the five underlying chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics not ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ ere , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , no significant pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration or@@ ical met@@ o@@ cl@@ op@@ r@@ ami@@ ds , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in one of a population of the pharmac@@ ist analy@@ tic analysis , it was shown that the simultaneous generation of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ ine , C@@ im@@ et@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , fluor@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ ine , and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience on the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is necessary from the treatment doctor . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to ob@@ serving side effects ( total 633 patients ) that were at least possibly with alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and shelter ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity and reaction at appointments ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and p@@ ains ) were reported in Post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of unwanted events like in the other met@@ ering groups ; there were no dose of drugs .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were conducted , however , due to the large number of distribution , a di@@ aly@@ sis is likely not an effective therapy for a alo@@ xi@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ ind@@ ented studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients were compared with ≤ 50 mg / m2 , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , with patients compared to 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , which was given to day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised twin @-@ ind@@ les , a total of 667 patients , which were a strongly em@@ bent chemotherapy with &gt; 60 mg / m Cycl@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ ere , and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin , and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received , which were given 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given to 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of the studies with moderate em@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ as@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy products are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy in@@ anim@@ ity and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate , and E@@ KG parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the findings of the clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion@@ ization channels and the duration of the action potential and to extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted with 221 healthy volunteers in the study was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in sol@@ em@@ osis of 0,25 , 0,75 and 49 mg . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption of intraven@@ ous gene is following a initi@@ ational decrease of the plas@@ ma centr@@ ations , a slow eli@@ mination from the body with an average monthly half @-@ time of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plas@@ on@@ cent@@ ric ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentr@@ ations @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dosage area of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer victims dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans , the division between day 1 and day 5 common ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ ogen@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total exposure of 0,25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the volume of 0,75 mg higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated about the kid@@ neys and roughly 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ites which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron above less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies to Met@@ abol@@ ization have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in short dimensions , the I@@ so@@ en@@ cyclop@@ edia CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have been found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made approximately 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; according to a unique intraven@@ ous bolt of bolt in healthy , the overall physical condition 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in patients with severe liver functioning , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ aker @-@ time and the average system@@ ic exposure with pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of dose is therefore non @-@ justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects have been observed only after ex@@ positions which are regarded as sufficient to the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance to the clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From the clinical trials took care of that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only be involved in very high concentr@@ ations of ion@@ ization channels , which can be involved in v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ arization and can extend the promotion of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose has been given in about the 30@@ times of the therapeutic exposure to men ) , which resulted in a multip@@ lied incidence of Leb@@ ert@@ um@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ tics ( thy@@ ro@@ id , pit@@ uit@@ ary ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is determined to be a unique application , the relevance of these results is minimal . &quot;

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative expertise in which the authorisation of approval for the handling of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C drugs using Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means Al@@ ph@@ eon of a biological medicine named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same cell @-@ effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; reference &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long an@@ hal@@ ted ) hepatitis C ( one by viral infections ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue shows damages , moreover , the values of the Leb@@ er@@ en@@ cyclop@@ ae@@ ine Amin@@ o transfer ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood ab@@ normal . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimul@@ ates this to the formation of the drug . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon made data submitted to the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( efficacy structure , composition and purity of the drug , power , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients infected with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 455 patients &apos; effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; in the study , how many patients were measured after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after h@@ iring the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns were raised and expressed that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the drug . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease has more patients back on than with the reference heads ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test in the study was introduced to the investigation of the question , where the drug forms a immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cruci@@ fied dis@@ infection ) , and small in@@ quired Laz@@ er@@ ations ( cr@@ acking or cuts ) , wast@@ es and se@@ wn wo@@ unds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ysts resistant to Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go does not affect these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months but in patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
&quot; if the patient speaks to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works through block@@ ade the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omen ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
&quot; the main index of the effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients , whose infection had shorten@@ ed after the end of the treatment . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.2 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo languages spoke to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected house wo@@ unds , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ exin have similar points : if the results of both studies were gathered at Hau@@ tw@@ unden , spoke about 90 % of the patients of both groups to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go has been observed in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( vain cav@@ ity in the body tissues ) or from infections that have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation on the order site .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) initiated to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial infections opposite the risks are over@@ hau@@ led : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • in@@ ised small la@@ vers , de@@ mis@@ ses or se@@ wn wo@@ unds . &quot;
May 2007 the European Commission shared the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients who show no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and be considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ tizing or severe local irrit@@ ation through the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment has been interrupted , the ano@@ int@@ ment has been carefully scrut@@ ini@@ zed and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection . &quot;
&quot; ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as Er@@ re@@ ger , or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in clinical trials included in secondary wo@@ unds , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or a deterioration of the infected job occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plas@@ on@@ cent@@ ric centr@@ ations , which were reached with people after top@@ ical use on de@@ mis@@ ter skin or infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant im@@ itation in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After a simultaneous presence of 2 @-@ times 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the average ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on ch@@ opped skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not considered to be required when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction in@@ tox@@ icity to oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the killing / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
&quot; ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if an top@@ ical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clear , and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a systematic antibiotic . &quot;
&quot; when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / end , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be ended , is between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials to 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial rash , the Al@@ tar@@ go was used , the most frequently reported side effects of irrit@@ ation at the destination , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ atives of Pl@@ euro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by Fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus . &quot;
&quot; the drug mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on sel@@ ective inhi@@ bit of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a particular binary system of the bacter@@ i@@ als of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms , which differs from the bin@@ s of other ri@@ gen@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data indicate that the binary @-@ site of the Bosni@@ an protein L@@ 3 is involved in the region of the ri@@ Bosni@@ an P @-@ Bin@@ ding center and Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ Centre .
&quot; by connecting to this bin@@ der point inhi@@ bit Pl@@ euro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line , pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , blocking the pe@@ p@@ tion@@ - interactions and prevent the normal formation of active collectors &quot; Bosni@@ an under@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should be obj@@ ection@@ able due to the local prevalence of resistance to the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , at least some infection forms , should be a consultation by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity from Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in were . &quot;
&quot; in the case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults was 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and on to@@ wed skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary weapons were obtained single plastic map@@ le . &quot;
the sampling took place on the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each prior to the medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of the people after top@@ ical use of 1 % Sal@@ be to 200 c@@ m2 to@@ wed skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP @-@ Hem@@ hal@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human@@ ized liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily convey@@ ed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies for oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive Leb@@ er- and thy@@ ro@@ id . &quot;

&quot; there was neither male nor female rats in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reducing up to 5 @-@ times higher exposure was reached as the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that apply the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be used within the framework of a two doses existing vacc@@ ination to protect hepatitis B could possibly be reached after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when the imm@@ uni@@ zation consists of a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vaccine can be run from two doses existing vaccines . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is undes@@ irable , Ambi@@ rix can be given or another Hepatitis A vaccine . &quot;
&quot; vaccines effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as it can be forced against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and the surface of anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as which since 1996 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children .
&quot; the three vaccines have been used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix can administ@@ ered children under one of three doses of existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are included ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix is also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , who had developed one month after the last injection of an ar@@ mor@@ ant anti @-@ concentration . &quot;
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection on the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix is similar to six months and at a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , Ap@@ peti@@ t@@ man@@ gel , pain at the injection site , redness , mat@@ in@@ ability ( ti@@ redness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) , are not applied . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission shared the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
&quot; the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ cing with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administ@@ ered at the time of choosing and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her , it is desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ als vaccines or with a combined vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) -@@ antibodies are in the same size as according to vacc@@ ination with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ als vaccines .
&quot; it is still not fully secured , whether immun@@ o competent persons who may need to have a refres@@ her , a refres@@ her , as it may well be protected at no longer det@@ ectable antibodies , possibly by the immun@@ otherap@@ ist memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all inj@@ ections should be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine corresponding to medical treatment and monitoring , always immediately available . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ mp@@ g@@ sch@@ ema is recommended using the combination simp@@ atic drug , the 360 ELISA units of formal hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface . &quot;
&quot; with ha@@ yst@@ aly@@ sis and persons with disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti @-@ antibodies is achieved , so in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an in@@ tra@@ der@@ mal injection , or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal vaccine success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; with Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ ie or blood @-@ minded disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be sub@@ cut@@ ted sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases to in@@ tram@@ us@@ tic@@ ulous gift to blood . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix has been administ@@ ered in the second life year in the form of a separate inj@@ eri@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated carbon vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined masks vaccine administ@@ ered , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective , it must be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , which was performed with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ern@@ ess , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ i@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever comparable with the frequency that was observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccine . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 2029 vacc@@ ination Ambi@@ rix were administ@@ ered at a total of 10@@ 27 implications in the age of 1 to including 15 . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix has been compared to the 3 @-@ doses of the 3 @-@ doses . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and sailors on a calculation base for a vaccine based on a vaccine basis per person . however , not on a calculation base per person . &quot;
&quot; pain has been observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the test subjects , compared with 39,@@ 1 % in the test@@ es after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans of combination skin . &quot;
&quot; after the whole vacc@@ inations reported 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the test@@ es , the Ambi@@ rix had received , about ache , compared to 6@@ 3.2 % in the proportions that have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dos@@ - combination @-@ case character . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of sailors was compared high ( d. h. over the total vacc@@ inations at 39.@@ 6 % of the test@@ es , the Ambi@@ rix were compared with 36,@@ 2 % in the trial , which received the 3 @-@ cans of combined ) . &quot;
the frequency of distinctive p@@ ains and sailors was low and comparable that was observed after administration of the combined vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study during 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ influ@@ x , the appearance of local actions and general transactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to which with the 3 @-@ cans of formal hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface area . &quot;
&quot; however , at the 6@@ - until 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , according to vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix had a common appearance of pain ( an injection site ) per dose , not per party . &quot;
the share of vacc@@ ination which have severe unwanted side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B - was not different .
&quot; clinical trials which were carried out at vacc@@ ination at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ converted rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 99@@ ,@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ o@@ converted rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was carried out at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two cans Ambi@@ rix and 147 were combined with three doses . &quot;
&quot; with 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ational rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dos@@ en@@ im@@ pf@@ d it is significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were reached in a clinical compar@@ ative study during 1@@ - to 11 year @-@ old one month after the end of the full vaccine ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ination were either a 2 @-@ cans vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combined vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface .
persons who were at the time of gr@@ aci@@ di@@ mm@@ ation between 12 and 15 years old could be proven the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies over at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immune response to both anti@@ gens was comparable to that which was established after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination fence consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface in a dosage volume of 0,5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccine is comparable to that of the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .
&quot; if the first dose is Ambi@@ rix in the second life year simultaneously with the refres@@ her Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ active pol@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us , in@@ activated carbon vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was adequate . &quot;
a clinical study that was performed with 3 cans of the present formulation in adults showed for the current formulation of similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ational and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates as for the former formulation .
the vaccine is both before and after the Res@@ us@@ pen@@ dium by ey@@ eball on any foreign language and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; the Hepatitis A virus is usually transferred through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as by bathing in through dra@@ ined waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark @-@ urine , a bl@@ asting face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( joint search ) and other symptoms that may possibly be a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against an infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ination was completed with 2 cans . &quot;
if you are infected / your child before the administration of both vaccines or hepatitis B virus ( although you don &apos;t feel uncomfortable or sick ) can feel a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that cause the liver ash@@ amed or symptoms , which are similar to those of an hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• If you have shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express through ju@@ cking rash to express respir@@ ation or swelling of the face or tongue . • if you have occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • if you have / your child has a serious infection with fever .
&quot; • If you want to have protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the provision of the second vacc@@ inations of the second vacc@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; in a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccine , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead he will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combin@@ ant hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced sal@@ ary of effective components per vaccine in a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface area ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with decreased sal@@ ary to effective components usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine before end the vacc@@ ination .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from individuals who suffer from severe blood @-@ minded problems under the skin and not into the muscle tissue . • if you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s own resistance .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these persons on vaccine can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
&quot; 21 If you are taking your doctor , if you are taking your child further medicines , or if you have received / or if you have received / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or if you have planned / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or if you have planned this in the near future . &quot;
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as different extre@@ mi@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix will be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix swelling or nursing women is not administ@@ ered unless it is urgent that they will be vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
all very common ( more than one case per 10 inj@@ un@@ ces c@@ anned ) : • pain or complaints at the inser@@ tion or redness • mat@@ in@@ ability • head@@ aches • Ap@@ peti@@ tiveness • Ap@@ peti@@ t@@ man@@ gel

Ambi@@ rix is available in packages for 1 to 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which have become known since issu@@ ing the first approval for the transport sector , toler@@ ate the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix will remain positive . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix has been brought to transport only in one Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ full endo@@ cardi@@ ac disease , or with hyper@@ op@@ ic end@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain damage caused by high ammon@@ ak@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations ) in pre @-@ history . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps is reduced - split by several single p@@ ants to meals - sw@@ allowed , under the food mixed or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ ath ( through the abdom@@ inal ceiling in the stomach &apos;s main hose ) or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de ( through the nose in the stomach &apos;s main hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps can not be compared to any other treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a head@@ y medication that is to be compared without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to appeti@@ te loss , a ab@@ normal inf@@ usion in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , liquid disease , fatigue , nau@@ sea , dro@@ pping , rash , rash , rash , rash , uncomfortable post@@ uring or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) initiated to the conclusion that amp@@ mon@@ aps are effectively prevented in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , because due to the rar@@ ity of the illness at the time of authorisation only limited information on this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is indi@@ ces in all patients , in which a complete enzy@@ me are already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born child ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a bel@@ t@@ manipul@@ ated form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , which is manifest@@ ed according to the first life of life , if in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese consists of a hyper@@ op@@ ic endo@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to sw@@ allow tablets or for patients with slots is AM@@ MON@@ APS also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
the daily dose will be individually calculated for the patient @-@ toler@@ ant and the growth and development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as at home @-@ growing and adult . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ko@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or argin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with a Ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must have argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ APS tablets may not be administ@@ ered to patients with slots , since there is a risk to the emergence of Ö@@ soph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a when the tablets are not immediately available in the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MON@@ APS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ APS , therefore , in case of patients with con@@ sti@@ cal in@@ suff@@ iciency , or severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency , as well as with so@@ dium and eastern clinical conditions , should be applied only with caution . &quot;
since Met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at on the liver and the kid@@ neys should be used AM@@ MON@@ APS in patients with liver or kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency only with extreme caution .
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS during pregnancy is therefore contr@@ ain@@ dicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; with sub@@ cut@@ aneous m@@ abe of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slo@@ wing of ne@@ ural multip@@ lication and an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; it also found a del@@ ayed m@@ aturing of crus@@ hed syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain , and thus a disability of brain growth . &quot;
&quot; it could not be noticed whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at humans in the mother &apos;s milk , and for that reason is the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ APS , at 56 % of patients stood at least an unwanted event ( AE ) to and at 78 % of these unwanted events was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MON@@ APS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , common ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ APS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 year old ab@@ normal patient , which developed a metabo@@ lic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , severe Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine , rhin@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of super@@ vis@@ ing stood at a five month old babies with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limit neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabo@@ lic active connection that con@@ it@@ ates through acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine contained by the kid@@ neys .
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally viewed is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative support for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for each gram there are so@@ dium yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
it is of significance that diagnosis early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and the clinical result .
the progn@@ osis of the earliest symptoms of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born child was almost always inf@@ ist and the disease carried himself in treating with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ ck@@ eting an@@ alogue within the first life year to death . &quot;
&quot; due to ha@@ et@@ aly@@ sis , the use of altern@@ ating ways of nit@@ rogen ox@@ ic@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , so@@ dium herb and natural sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to diagnose re@@ perc@@ ep@@ tive re@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) diagnosed to 80 % . &quot;
patients diagnosed with patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the survival rates were 100 % , but even with these patients there was time with many to spiritual disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late t@@ amper@@ ed form of the disease ( including female patients with the heter@@ ozy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ko@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ op@@ ic endo@@ cr@@ acy and a prot@@ rac@@ ted diet , was the survi@@ ving rate 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological state .
&quot; it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is called in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites in Plas@@ ma and Ur@@ in were obtained after gift of a single dose of 5 g of so@@ dium hydro@@ flu@@ oric acid and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous gift by Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a or@@ al single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ in in tablet form have been observed 15 minutes after taking mess@@ engers Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ cent@@ ric of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .

&quot; det@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood access to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ary ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( a anom@@ aly worth during electro@@ cardi@@ og@@ ram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; will be used An@@ gi@@ ox for preventing blood cl@@ auses when patients apply to a PCI slot , a higher dose is administ@@ ered and the inf@@ usion can continue up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack on maintaining blood flow towards the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients took part in the main stage for the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in all@@ evi@@ ch or in connection with a gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a different medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ams ) with the traditional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI was compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI patients frequently asked a st@@ ent ( a short tube , that stays in the arter@@ ies to prevent a lock ) , and they received additionally other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ams , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attack or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who subjected to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective in terms of all indicators as effective as Hep@@ arin , except in heavy blood@@ lines , in which it was clearly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other sh@@ ud@@ ins or any of the other constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to patients who recently had a bl@@ eeding , as well as with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney disease or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ geons ( CH@@ MP ) aimed at the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin .
September 2004 the European Commission shared the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ lever in@@ far@@ ewell ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) at a emergency relief or when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended Initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt from 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0,25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out in further a result , an additional shaft of 0.5 mg / kg and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery on 1,75 mg / kg / h increases . &quot;
after the PCI may be resum@@ ed after clinical needs the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg can be given , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of Rhin@@ oplast@@ y . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an Initi@@ al intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and one in the immediate subsequent cop@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of a single bolt @-@ gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned . &quot;
&quot; is this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) on under 225 seconds , a second bolt should be made of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ tive and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed against the application and the bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis rapidly administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1,75 mg / kg Inf@@ usi@@ ons@@ d@@ osis is properly administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with medium @-@ severe kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,@@ 4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
lies the ACT value below 225 seconds is a second b@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg to be administ@@ ered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second t@@ us@@ d@@ osis .
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney disease , which conducted in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which conducted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value 5 minutes after gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at the average 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney shield ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ tic patients is con@@ fer@@ ous ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be introduced 30 minutes after ending the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated hep@@ at@@ arin or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous g@@ era of lower molecular hep@@ at@@ arin .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or any other components or against her@@ ud@@ ins • active bl@@ eeding or higher @-@ resistant bl@@ ending disorders . • severe un@@ controll@@ able hyper@@ tension and sub@@ stan@@ tive bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney failure ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ tic patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment to monitor symptoms and signs of a blood pressure especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administ@@ ered in combination with an other anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in PCI @-@ patients occur under Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in most blood items to arter@@ ial points , can occur in patients suffering from an per@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) while treatment in principle throughout blood . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking the war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in , should be considered a monitoring of IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International normal @-@ ised Rati@@ o ) to ensure that the value after lowering the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in once again achieved this before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti @-@ antibodies ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ ne or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ lic aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the blood danger . &quot;
&quot; with the combination of bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in with Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ m@@ em@@ bers or antibodies , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al parameters are regularly monitored regularly . &quot;
&quot; the experimental investigations have been inadequate in terms of effects on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , in@@ quired or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see under Section 5.3 ) . &quot;

&quot; the attachment of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turn turns out the attachment of Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus reducing the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates . &quot;

&quot; in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was reduced % after six months with Api@@ dra compared to 0,30 per cent in human @-@ normal . &quot;
&quot; Api@@ dra must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other constitu@@ ents , or in patients suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of Api@@ dra must be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood@@ shed .
September 2004 the European Commission shared the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH - a permit for the transport of Api@@ dra in the entire European Union .
Api@@ dra is to apply as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections either in the area of the abdom@@ inal veins , th@@ igh@@ s or del@@ ut@@ ut@@ an by continuous Inf@@ usion in the area of the abdom@@ inal thickness . &quot;
&quot; due to the decreased gl@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ished ins@@ ulin delivery , the ins@@ ulin needs to be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the brand ( Her@@ e@@ aster ) , the ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ del@@ ayed , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal @-@ ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can be a change in ins@@ ulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or the break@@ down of a treatment , in particular in patients with an ins@@ ulin diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ki@@ ebox ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or a ins@@ ulin of a different vend@@ or should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage .
the time of occurrence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the drug profile of the used ins@@ ulin types and can therefore change adaptation of the treatment process .
&quot; related to the substances , which can increase blood sugar levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ ine , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ convertible , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , s@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , s@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and Sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ etic such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reserves the symptoms of the ep@@ in@@ ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , counter @-@ regulation , or are missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive medicine showed no differences between In@@ su@@ pr@@ ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin regarding pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ ale development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ enters into the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general , ins@@ ulin does not occur in the breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ably res@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; following are those of clinical trials known by those undes@@ irable remedies : &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally : &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of if availability ) . &quot;

&quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y Wir@@ d failed to switch the inj@@ ector within the injection , can occur in the episode a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y at the injection site . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ bodies with consci@@ ous@@ less@@ ness can be given by means of in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that is given by a corresponding person or by intraven@@ ous gene of gl@@ uc@@ ose by a doctor .
&quot; according to a gl@@ uc@@ tance for the patient , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the prim@@ acy thing for the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin lo@@ wers the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the im@@ itation of gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be carried out by ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ers in the efficiency comes faster and the drug @-@ duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal @-@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male individuals at the age of 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the therapeutic range of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg a dis@@ proportionate increase of glu@@ cos@@ ity effects , just like human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast as norm@@ alities such as norm@@ ality human@@ ins@@ ulin and achiev@@ es the complete air @-@ cosmic effect approximately 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; from the data it was obvious that in an application of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ous gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human@@ em normal ins@@ ulin , which is 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , became a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control than with human@@ em normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with human@@ em normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - n@@ utes before the meal ( see picture 1 ) . &quot;
