<seg id="6">"Abilify is applied for the treatment of intermediate to severe manic episodes and prevention of manic episodes in patients suffering from the past of the drug, used in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural disorder when the orale intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be applied to one or the melting-tablets in patients who are being prepared to cure tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose should be adapted from Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitter "," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication between nerve cells among each other. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"Aripiprazol probably works mainly as a" partial Agist "for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (including serotonin)."</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripipzol such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and Dopamine, but in less than the neurotransmitter acts to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder contributes to normalize the activity of the brain to normalize, causing psychotic or manic symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Abilify's effectiveness, to prevent the encounter of symptoms, was investigated in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of injecting solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia, or similar diseases, which compared to increased unrest, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in a further study, Abilify took over 12 weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of abilify and placebo that have been stabilized in 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injecting solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that compared to increased unrest (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours compared.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the changes in the symptoms of the patients were examined using a standard skala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients carrying on treatment."</seg>

<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significant reduction in symptoms increased unrest than the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">The application for treatment of bipolar disorder has decreased Abilify in four of the five Kurzzlement studies more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented also up to 74 weeks long more effective than placebo the re-occur Manic episodes previously treated with patients and if it was added in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>

<seg id="25">"the Committee on Humantherapeutic agents (CHMP) aimed at the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia, and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes filmed on the treatment with Aripidizol."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injecting solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia, or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar disorder, if an orale therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 the European Commission shared the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a licence for the transport of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is prescribed for treatment of moderate to heavy manic episode in the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes to treatment with Aripiprazol. (see Section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder in patients &gt; 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initialosis should be considered as clinical factors to justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 investigator is set off from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dosage should be reduced to recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicide behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases at the beginning or after a change of an anti-psychotic therapy even in treating with Aripidizol (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder they have no increased addiction risk with Aripidizol compared to other antipsychotic medication.</seg>

<seg id="52">"with CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolising the common application can result in high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plastic-centralized populations of Aripipzol, compared to CYP2D6 extenders Metabolisiern."</seg>
<seg id="53">"when you consider the joint gift of Ketoconazol or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should prevail to the patient's potential risks."</seg>
