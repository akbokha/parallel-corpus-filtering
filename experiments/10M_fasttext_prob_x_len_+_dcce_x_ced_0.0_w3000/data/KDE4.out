&quot; package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their low size , they offer some extra functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available . &quot;
more information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in features can be found in the manual &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions ... Open the box card tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of standard modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
you should install the k@@ base base that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on the crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if available . &quot;
the module In@@ sight@@ filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar below extras
&quot; to use the DO@@ M developers in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , choose extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as a pre @-@ setting , the display begins with the root mark of the document , example : document@@ aries , all other knots are sub@@ elements of this wor@@ e h@@ ubs . &quot;
the module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; a further view is used for objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type I@@ node / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text @-@ views to view the content of your local file system .
&quot; the partic@@ ular@@ ity of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists in it , sub@@ mer@@ ed folder @-@ hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is displayed by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; by &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereas the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is specified . therefore , big files , even if they can be seen far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ instruction you will be considered . &quot;
in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ aties representation is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for easy navigation you own the rect@@ angle of useful color and coating settings .
&quot; the colour of a rect@@ angle , which is switched on display mode , can either be depth for the slight detection of the mer@@ ging or the illustration of a different file name such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify , if enough space available for representation is available , or if there is enough space to display in the sign of the stairs ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in Dar@@ ing algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ aties &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; this goal is not always maintained to present the sub@@ ordinate entries is no longer available . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rect@@ angle square shaped . &quot;
&quot; as spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries is made , the implementation is left to pass . here it is for the det@@ ecting and avoiding space dri@@ es by frame always advantageous to create the areas that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum order for an entry on the menu entry view on the area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this surface is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordinate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
the image gallery gallery can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extr@@ as picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

display the image size of the picture show you whether the file size is displayed among the mini@@ pictures in the gallery .
&quot; with the cross @-@ box image size , show you whether the size of the images is displayed among the mini @-@ pictures in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , you specify where the gallery will be stored and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file sel@@ ector save in HTML file , enter where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ box sub@@ folder , you can set up with a sli@@ der or a hub , up to which level the sub@@ folder are included . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ box original images , copy whether the original images are to be copied to the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check@@ box comm@@ ent@@ ate file , you can specify a commentary file for the marking of images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the cross @-@ field fields , you can specify a different color @-@ depth than in the original pictures for the mini@@ umb@@ nails . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extr@@ as HTML @-@ settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

&quot; a simple to use camera location is made available to you , so that you can connect to your digital camera and support your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ .@@ -@@ albums . of course , each medium and each dealer which is supported by your OS , with &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; working together . &quot;
&quot; Inst@@ alled ; contains a fast image processing with basic imaging tools . you can use these to view your photos , comment , to evaluate and correct . the processing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image plug @-@ in ( manual ) modules easily . &quot;
&quot; though &amp; digi@@ ess ; easy to use , it provides frag@@ ment professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit Far@@ br@@ aum and all available modules support the raw converted by li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC colour@@ ing work@@ flow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with significantly more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as a eg ; via the camera or the lens , which can be looked for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ess ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities . &quot;
&quot; once came , the mil@@ king of problems or suggestions are as easy as possible for them . where you will find yourself in the program , the help menu includes an entry issues or wishes . this opens up a dialog with a sub@@ ordinate link . all required information is already registered here . follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; she came ; is a project that is supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developer would help each other . if you want to answer any questions to other users . however , in this mailing list , however , you should answer questions about other users . in this mailing list , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ came ; homepage visit to know news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ tization ; to learn .
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ ess ; to participate , is the registration in the developer mailing list . guidance on the registration in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ came ; . &quot;
&quot; when you got it ; for the first time you are asked , where you want to store your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder , or click on the folder icon , to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data is saved . this path remains the same for all the image folder . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folder as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ came , you will also use as al@@ locate library . settings swi@@ f@@ am set . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can indicate the top folder , the images contains , as a base folder . &quot;
&quot; once came ; thir@@ sts the libr@@ arian inside his whole depth . you can shut out no sub@@ folder , unless it was i@@ ste in hidden folder . this allows you to finish a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums on My Al@@ ben@@ ds will not take photos as symbols . you can change the ones by using any photo from the album and use this on the folder symbol . further details can be found in the albums section . &quot;
&quot; once you configure the base folder , you can set up into &amp; digi@@ tization ; your digital camera set up . afterwards you should learn how to manage my albums and my key@@ word to manage your photos into the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw data support : in case you use the raw mode of your camera , so you may deal with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , so you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help feed@@ backs . &quot;
how you set up and work with pipe files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ o@@ der@@ settings and ro@@ h work@@ flow .
&quot; a simple to use camera location is made available to you , so that you can connect to your digital camera and support your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ .@@ -@@ albums . of course , each medium and each dealer which is supported by your OS , with &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; working together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are registered by using Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transfer . the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the connection to the seri@@ als port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; F@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , advanced software collection for digital cameras that has been developed an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are large files and transmission via the seri@@ als port is slow , this connection has been out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ tised : supports these cameras and leads the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must be created with li@@ bex@@ if support , so that the support images may be read by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 @-@ camera drivers . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you will be able to feel free , or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to think about it ; is how easy to extend its functionality by module :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE image plugins interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common module for &amp; digi@@ tization ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; you can manipul@@ ate pictures in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to add &amp; digi@@ ess ; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ ess ; even perform . &quot;
to simplify the window you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + F .
&quot; you can drag and drop images everywhere : you can lay a picture in a different part of the tree tree , above the horizontal partition line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture can not be displayed in key@@ word , file list or suit . &quot;
&quot; - a fil@@ yp@@ ical selection allows you to lift the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , films and Audio &quot;
&quot; the filter filter is used only for the fields that are currently used in the tool@@ bar , only if this ind it is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only when this ind it will also be displayed in the dialog box settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo@@ graphi@@ es . these albums were saved according to the folders , in which they were created on the hard disk , in which the album was created first , and the date may be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select the screens@@ hot directly to an album . select the album &quot; &quot; Im@@ por@@ ters &quot; &quot; photo . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to move the target album and drop it there . you can move to the same way via moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them onto the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection . to click on the album features , you must click with the right mouse button on the album and select in the context menu album properties . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to highlight your albums , so that you can choose your photos from the tool@@ bar or view albums sort by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections . if you want to add new collections or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for coll@@ ections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort out your albums on date with view albums sort by date by date .
&quot; the buttons el@@ dest , average , new : these put the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image , or the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
if you first came an album in &amp; digi@@ ess ; the first picture is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ ad@@ quot ; this is to help you to remember the photos of the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
&quot; to select a different photo as an album icon , you must click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album menu &amp; quot ; as well , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
one album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be wast@@ ed .
&quot; once came ; supports the input of key@@ boards for single photos in the field My key@@ word list on the left below in the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organise your photos . &quot;
&quot; the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images displayed in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these images with the two lou@@ ver buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album the first time you can just wait while the umb@@ nails will be generated , this can be avoided in which you can generate all the spect@@ ators in the menu Extr@@ as . &quot;
&quot; information about each image are shown below the preview &apos;s preview . what information this is , you can change over settings ; you can set up the albums page and adjust the range of images to your wishes . &quot;
the umb@@ nails have help you . if you rest the mouse c@@ ursor over a picture . the help shows the most important properties including all the tags of a photo . the screens@@ hot in the main window shows such an auxiliary window .
&quot; photos are all , what it comes to &amp; digi@@ ess ; goes . albums and tags allow you to organize your photos as it suits you . the picture editing shows your photos and allows you to get a number of improvements to these pages . you can reach the choice between the viewing menu of the images , a slides@@ how or the processing of images . &quot;
you can view the picture editing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 Photo Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and select ... select a guide as you can edit your photos . with image processing you can view your photos and change them .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ came ; the functionality you need , not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button . for this , and how you can custom@@ ize this your needs , if your program is not en@@ umer@@ ated , you will find information in &amp; k@@ en ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that it can come after processing by other image processing programs to problems with the images contained in the picture . some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , bl@@ eeding etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pres@@ ent ; provides two options for shooting at the disposal . the easiest way is to select it with the right mouse button on the preview and select , in the sub@@ menu , you can indicate the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ames of a photo , you can click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; remove a photo from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ; delete , it is del@@ ayed in the mam@@ el@@ lei@@ gh of &amp; k@@ de ; postpon@@ ed . f@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or dec@@ f Falls you prefer really delete , you can use this by using Shi@@ ft ; de@@ f . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ came ; use either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture show . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et down in the data sheet , so you can only see the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; photos with sampling provide a flexible and powerful option to organize and kat@@ alogue . tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search . &quot;
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all photos that have been marked with this key@@ word displayed . &quot;
&quot; Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : you can be log@@ ged in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also combine your keywords , you can also combine parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot; &quot; key@@ word &quot; &quot; so you can find the keywords you can find easily . &quot;
&quot; tags are stored in a database for quick access and agreed key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also use your tags in the loss of database re @-@ imported as soon as possible ; the pictures noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; key@@ word &quot; &quot; button . if you add a new key@@ word after you click on an existing one , this is the key@@ word of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and delete it . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself is not deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a key@@ word by moving it to the desired position in the tree and set out there . then a menu , which gives you the possibility to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in the tree . &quot;
&quot; you can edit the properties of a key@@ word by selecting it with the right mouse button and select in the context menu , you can edit the name of the password and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to select a different photo as an album icon , you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu As Alb@@ ums . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to deal &amp; digi@@ ess ; s functionality with key@@ word to deal with , you must first select your photos with key@@ word . alternatively , you can click the photos with a key@@ word . alternatively , you can also click on the images to view the images and select from the context menu key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can add a photo with any number of tags . the photo will display as soon as you select one of the key@@ word on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with key@@ word , this is displayed under the preview of the picture in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word in which you can open the menu menu of the photos and select from the keywords menu , and the menu shows you only the keywords which were assigned to the photo . &quot;
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ based hist@@ o@@ grams of the number of images per time unit . a selection framework can click on this hist@@ og@@ ram . to select a time frame that gives you only to the lower rect@@ angle of the selection framework . this will display all associated pictures in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . then it appears in the list below .
&quot; cover all elements of the database : name , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , fil@@ ings and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; fo@@ ile he search box is a small lamp the green when the search results occur . if you click here , the fil@@ tering is deleted and all the pictures displayed again . if the search has not found anything then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side@@ bar with the tel@@ esc@@ ope . you can save this search here as a live search that has always been described as a live search , which always saved the fil@@ tering what you entered as a search crit@@ erion . after you saved it a filter in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results will be displayed in view of my search list . if you choose your selection to search in my search list , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you select search , the form for the input of search returns with the previously published search information . if you want to edit as an advanced search , the dialog is for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you can find more information in section The tool for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu search . &quot;
&quot; Ex@@ tended search provides you an extended search form with many search engines , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tization ; s database can be used . &quot;
&quot; the list of the search rules will be used to add the options for a search query in the album database . all rules will be added and deleted by operators . each option can be added with other over the logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or Min@@ es ... wi@@ red . in addition , you can create addi@@ ction of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; &quot;
&quot; once came ; character@@ izes every picture by a long number with a special technique that compar@@ es hair algorith@@ m . this allows images to compare these sig@@ natur@@ es . the lower the difference between two images , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can let each picture drop out to be a similar one . by means of a s@@ ell@@ erts , the results can be zo@@ omed from somewhere else over the symbol of the un@@ used search in the left side@@ bar , then you will open up and you can drop it there . &quot;
&quot; sketch : open @-@ hand color sk@@ iz@@ ze : draw a quick sketch and look , finds the matching pictures . even here you can set a pig . &quot;
this tab puts an intuitive navigation tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ Programme . you can fil@@ tered with the mouse or out zo@@ oming or it and move it . move it while you are fil@@ tered with the mouse button . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this sets up your pictures Ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can indicate a name for your ge@@ o filter . this is then added for a later use of the list below . he works like a live Geo@@ ord@@ ner .
&quot; once came ; puts a lighthouse in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image data formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more pictures from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em phosph@@ ates add from the menu menu . the selection is added to the lighthouse menu and its window , you can quickly open the lighthouse quickly with L extras . &quot;
&quot; from the view@@ ings you can compare the images you want to compare , to the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow indicates that copy in what window area is to be taken . you can also compare them to the other image . so you can compare the same area of both images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to select quickly from a picture series , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded onto the tool@@ bar . then use the left mouse button on the right side . this is easier to display it through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , ordinary holes are working directly from the lighthouse , such as F@@ 4 file mach@@ ining .... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both models in the light table . this makes it e.g. easy visual differences with cl@@ adding data .
&quot; at the bottom end of each section you will find a built @-@ in swing function , which you follow in the crossed paths . to res@@ ist the visible area of the picture , you need to press this an@@ click and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed . in the mode P@@ review , both images can show the same picture range . &quot;

&quot; what is a digital component management - off from the fashion word ? digital component management considers every part of the process of the process after the picture was taken , sc@@ ans or digital photos stores a form of digital printing management . however , most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images . we focus on the procedure for digital photography &apos;s . we focus on the procedure for digital photography &apos;s . we focus on the procedure for digital phot@@ o@@ grapher . we focus on the procedure , backup , up@@ setting , archiving , maintain , maintain , and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; digital component management takes on , indic@@ ted , categ@@ orized , seeks , transform@@ er@@ ated , conf@@ ection@@ ate and exported content that have a mon@@ ary or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata are defined in accordance with your definition data to provide information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to know how many photos you have , then use it very fast search and secure archiving to you with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
the first thing you do and need to know before you have to fit into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . you have to decide whether other access to your photos are to be stored or on a network drive &amp; etc ; check out that you will eventually change to a larger drive .
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday images can be found quickly over your location . if you want to make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is then a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flow , constant access from pictures to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % of work files will not be able to organise your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the stack easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working @-@ files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the option to store met@@ ad@@ ata in the installation of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ tization ; this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file , then you can save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the menu album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change whatever you want ? to make it a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , since you now have to select every photo keywords , complaint and a review . of course , you can select the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now get key@@ word , key@@ word , as you are often called on other programs or go to categories . all three are syn@@ onymous for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import Cat@@ alog@@ ical images from another source with built @-@ in key@@ word , then it &apos;s going to put the images on the right place . the circum@@ stance of Hier@@ archy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by moving a sub@@ tree to another . the altered key@@ word will be followed by &amp; digi@@ tization ; updated while there are the trees @-@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is out@@ cut itself . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata consists in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates are properties of all paintings . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to complaint , or comments , the third important tool to catalogue your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want most anyone to just let your photos simply be seen , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then start to see some details , people , the square . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this is the Al@@ de@@ place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . Wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical time span is back again , you might even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panoramic view . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create a story . remember , the key is to transfer a story to help Him via the mot@@ if you moved to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine when a picture is not perfect , if it has strength has only with a sign for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ring , you can store any amount of text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , and you can even export it for a selection of images simultaneously . you can even tell it for a selection of pictures at the same time . you have to tell it for a selection of web galleries and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . &quot;
do you remember the time before GPS ? when you had to find yourself in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities which extend the ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation are already un@@ think@@ able and will be able to re@@ portable in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your trips , but also to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and refers to the practice of copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all modified versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the interior page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and authors ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired , the name of a company or organization has been used , it should not be changed anymore . this field does not support com@@ mas or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as a partition . &quot;
&quot; author Tit@@ le ( syn@@ onym for fas@@ cists ) : associated with the author . examples of this field contains the work @-@ drawing of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent Phot@@ ograph@@ s . as this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be filled out as well . &quot;
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who the photo offers . this must not necessarily be the author . if the photographer does not necessarily be the author . if the photo is a stock photo , then the group / Agency will offer the image here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though this has no protection against abuse . each of which a little bit more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change . the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this protection is very important to the majority of your photos . for professionals and neck professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ ous , will provide such a module for p@@ ile processing in the near future . &quot;
&quot; topics : PL@@ AT@@ TEN@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , turn@@ loss , electricity bre@@ aches , ECC , transmission errors , ag@@ eing , des@@ ast@@ er@@ ation , life time , temperature , data size , common super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the road or a fire . this type of losses are the same which can happen to you even with traditional paper pictures or negative effects . in this section about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data protection firm in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs and you may not last longer than a few years . of course , you can also keep CDs and DVDs in archives . of course , there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 a piece of life span of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it is in your discretion . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording meg@@ ali@@ tions are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . it &apos;s about to select the right choice . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to error , even if you have just been written only . about 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and control . despite this massive protection they are needed for form@@ atting , ultr@@ avi@@ olet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defects CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster which seems to do wonders in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that damaged data of damaged disco@@ vers , HDDs , Flash@@ media , USB drives etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to gain the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost sixty @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs and also applies to Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; slowly , burn with a good recording meg@@ at@@ y on high quality media in an un@@ propri@@ ated format . read after that the data is stored on a clean , dark dry and above animals protected place . do not forget the data on the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; Disk@@ Manufactur@@ ers keep your statistics for yourself . their manufacturing erg@@ ers cover a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard@@ dis@@ ks and dis@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; in brief : dis@@ ks keep the longest in the temper@@ a range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ ament , this error can be found directly . some of S@@ MAR@@ T stipul@@ ates this error . these are in particular read@@ just@@ ments and publishing . this expected life time is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete anni@@ hil@@ ating due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a black@@ out before you have saved the files but these losses normally can be done without great problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices do not constitute a lot , this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed buttons , complete data loss , hardware replacement , non @-@ alter@@ cation , non @-@ alter@@ cation , destroyed motherboard and other defects . thus protect yourself from the un@@ avoidable which leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most widespread protection against power tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is part of the energy heat absor@@ bs and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . but remember that not every plug @-@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protecting the protection against light@@ ning bolt and thus protects the connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ load each cable can use to your computer , you should be careful that all Peri@@ ph@@ eri@@ des can be connected to your system . this also applies to phone lines and cable mode@@ ms , as well as by this one over@@ voltage . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial part of the cable mode@@ ms and the television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the mo@@ dem . this makes you ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection , your system protects against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the electricity lines it will not really help you in a complete loss . even an exp@@ ir@@ ation of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break@@ able power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection from over@@ ending machines , these devices can automatically provide cordless energy to save and install the system . if you purchase a US@@ V , then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . moreover , the life time of battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concerns the potential risk that your b@@ illing system is exposed and and compare his security regarding electrical disorders associated with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you think about how well your computer is protecting , always remember all cables before you ride in the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . using the right configuration you can use them as a backup under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to save it as a backup target for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data . &quot;
&quot; they are compared to the HDDs , although very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general security solution . therefore , it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are limited to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures more available , in the event of Flick@@ r dramatically anymore . for $ 25 per year you get un@@ restricted memory , which should be tested only in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically compatible with the TCP protocol and the big companies are included in the offer a backup and a distribut@@ ing memory . so that they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ated . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transmission are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integrity between operating system and disk .
the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you have been destroyed by one day and this to your surprise is destroyed . nobody seems to have been thinking about it . nobody seems to have been thinking about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
&quot; un@@ reliable power parts are a further source of transmission results , since they generate inter@@ c@@ itation within the data flow . with normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates to be low , with record @-@ errors in low levels . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ ust file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same prot@@ ections to use and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data transmission in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . at Not@@ ebooks is already the proportion of theft 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , e.g. theft or re @-@ install@@ ationen . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it has long been seen by no more . &quot;
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is not better than ext@@ 3 , travel F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process at a sudden stop during a surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided before the problem entered , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human mistakes are the major causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras are removed from digital cameras , 1 @-@ 2 bl@@ ending settings from fundamental physical borders . meant that during the technology there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and smoking characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border . &quot;
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution has already been too high for comp@@ act@@ cameras and high quality optics are the optimum for compens@@ ating cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or bigger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive will get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not take anyone else for data transfer . 6 % of all PCs are often subject to a plan and test this backup before you do something dangerous as the rein@@ st@@ allation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of a hard disk . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA disk . if , then one day , a flash strikes , you are lucky when the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aviation @-@ pressures : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ ation does not mean a local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring building , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as above already is a common reason for a loss of loss , despite securing the panic . if you have a backup this is not immediately available , then you can save the one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files that are to be saved . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
difference security : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete use . generates a complete snap@@ shot of two time points : the complete assurance and the last difference of difference .
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been modified since the last backup , and generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time the next one with the exception that it is only down@@ ward and not continuously . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . as opposed to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer @-@ tran@@ sp@@ ied only the difference of files they were really changed . this is happening com@@ pressed and if you want to increase security about ss@@ h .
&quot; secure important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer , a DVD or other optical medium . &quot;
this approach allows you enough time to detect loss and restore . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . each additional th@@ inner should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , in image file stored IP@@ TC information , original software , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ printed images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable images will survive the next 40 years , that is about the time span in which you are really interested in you because she will remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be respected : &quot;
&quot; since the future due to your nature is un@@ predic@@ table , all of the 5 @-@ 8 years you should consider yourself how the current system goes back@@ wards . the less varieties you have used in the past , the more easy it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
&quot; this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use , or change to open standards that are supported by many applications . &quot;
virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . thus , if you have an old system that is important to reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and back@@ ups technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional printing for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means to increase .
&quot; let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with a planned and set the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area , and you can shift to a new record : &quot;
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db # Source is / dev / s@@ dc / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ r ; # works with ext@@ 2,@@ 3 , fat@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software you can read it then you can create these self . this task will be easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary that disappears from the market slowly from the market . it therefore should not use it anymore .
&quot; P@@ NG was used as an open source standard developed by GI@@ F . however , it can be much more . it &apos;s lost @-@ free , supported X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and Chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved colour instruction at heter@@ ogen@@ eous platforms . this format we want to recommend you to save your pictures . &quot;
&quot; T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ com@@ pressed form or in a container with a des@@ pic@@ able com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ering algorithms . a problem is however , that this format is made by many people . there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative File format is a licence @-@ free and open @-@ format used by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G is now based on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP Format and is committed to the use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a handful of camera is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon it at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in order to replace its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers draw it in front of an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive . X@@ MP fits in addition , as it saves the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . however , you should think about problems when connecting the met@@ ad@@ ata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as containers and put everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization designed to support for fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , providing a large range of application purposes and business models , conferences and joint work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I groups , standard connections and enlight@@ ening efforts to achieve an extended acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the dealer or the scanner . as long as the images on the cam@@ ame@@ dium , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fin@@ ite processing , you can use external programs . if you want to edit the pictures again , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut down by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them in MPEG , use in MPEG , use in contact leaf@@ lets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; digi@@ ous ; to get a description of how you can add photos , which you can already add on your hard disk , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import of images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ came ; to use , connect them to the machine , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , you try to connect with your camera . if this is the case , a Finish indicator is displayed at the bottom and the umb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will display . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file assignment for each file , photos , movies , music etc . on the camera is displayed . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the page features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog features file properties and the photographic information that is stored internally from the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer , please note that there are not all information available at some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the rider Metad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as the image , manufacturing , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar , from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available at some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all the photos . this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ . we recommend you to check if the photos were downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired either with the standard either method of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then download it as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not been updated until now . if you select this option , the new images are downloaded , of course , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you use the buttons All download or download it , appears a dialog with which you can select the target album , shown as regular folder , displayed in the section My albums . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and how it came ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all of the button once you delete it . if you just want to delete a few , you need to select it first and then delete delete . &quot;
&quot; note that there is no possibility to reset photos that you deleted from the camera . so , they should be carefully checked whether the photos completely delete them . if you want to delete it from camera . if you want to delete the camera menu , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names often use as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos frequently not especially meaningful names . this can load to double fil@@ en@@ ames in the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for turning and mir@@ rors of the image and for file @-@ based sub@@ categories . if you use this last option , is automatically created a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three more options , which are carried out before the photos on the record can be stored in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
if you want a different file format than the standard format you can use e.g. in the mach@@ ining field the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . place the option &apos;s help to read the command str@@ f@@ time .
&quot; if you use the option camera file , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small letters . or in big letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which was used ; for a photo , it is shown below the name that displays the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are stored and automatically used if you open the camera &apos;s next time . &quot;
&quot; once came ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to the point of recording . not all cameras make this information ready . in the side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details , about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not delivers this information , lets you adjust it ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic rotation , use the button @-@ Exp@@ and@@ ed and select the automatic la@@ wing in the lower section of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera is made information about the date when the photo was made , it may be used ; this sub@@ categories are based on the image data . all images with the same date are made available in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras make this information available . in the side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read which information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally off @-@ off , and in that case stor@@ ing it ; the photos directly in target album . if you want to change this option . use the button @-@ based list@@ ings at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos of their computers to their camera is the button Download . select the file op@@ tionally . the file op@@ tionally dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods select .
&quot; after the selection selection is done , asks , asking if the images appear high . a folder selection dialog for the camera will be released . select the desired folder and press OK to load the up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . it is a position meant that can be displayed in long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal and l@@ ati@@ tude and that can be displayed on a map . identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only can link for professional photographs , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place . not everyone uses a plane to create an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and property mak@@ ers can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can click with a click on another browser which shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users wish to document the place of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good the position data of a photo to watch . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come in the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ ve v@@ 2 many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and map reference . the question is therefore more , how the data in these fields come from ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and finally over the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as card module or through the transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;

downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format which is supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract data from pictures and GPS . on the following page you can download the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal and l@@ ati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ ty Tool from Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the sign , for example from map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ .@@ googl@@ e.com shows no European road@@ cards . here are some European pages , at least in french , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; once came ; try to give as much control over his work@@ flows as possible ; there are many settings that addresses the behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; change to these settings , you need to set up in eight pages . you can change between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; select action can be set on built @-@ in preview or image processing , so you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ tion and the necessary legal data . this data is automatically selected to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . even in the database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s is a syn@@ onym for fas@@ cists : this field should be the professional drawing of the photographer . this can be design@@ ations such as an employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or more independent , commercial photographer . as this is a further description on the author , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to give the photo it . this must not be the author , if this is an image agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this means that the met@@ ad@@ ata was permanently contained in the picture and not only came in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization ; imported without getting lost .
&quot; images described as a built @-@ in prot@@ ector ( J@@ FI@@ F ) to JP@@ EG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with the images embedded in images . for example , these signs are also included by the images , these by which came by &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; over@@ written . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information that appear , if the mouse c@@ ursor in the main window above a file , depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; B &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tization ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and audio formats . to indicate which file extensions &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ents ; preview , you can add the file extensions to this list and remove any of these extensions , from &amp; digi@@ tis@@ fied ; ignored . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Ref@@ res@@ h to the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lighthouse was put on this site , however , can be placed on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can generate better results . &quot;
&quot; by default the image editing a black background behind the shown pictures . if you prefer a different color , you can select this here . you can use the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ lined areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker or h@@ eller color in the picture . these colours will be specified here . in picture editing , this picture mode can be installed with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance can be coded as in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the first explanation .
&quot; by setting P@@ NG com@@ pression you can reduce the size of the P@@ NG files . this operation does not require the image quality , since P@@ NG used a loss @-@ free algorith@@ m . if you have a quick computer , you can bet this value to a high com@@ pression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; with the option T@@ IF@@ F files com@@ press , you can switch to the default -@@ com@@ pres@@ sion@@ sal@@ g@@ algorithms for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it does not have any influence on the image quality since the defensive algorith@@ m is free . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of loss JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files , you can freely store . even if you have the shifting option is the ratio between quality loss and file size far better than with normal JP@@ EG . as this paragraph , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ ess , the image processing only was a picture @-@ stand for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for mani@@ p@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the picture editing process . &quot;
&quot; the default feature is that all green pixels are equal in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option shows the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates but the 2x@@ 2 G@@ etting pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD @-@ quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the white balance is used in the camera . otherwise , if it is set to use the automatic color balance . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white is not set off . default , it is a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white card that is photographed in sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that sub@@ str@@ ated images in four steps will get more detail in the cutting . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the default is the top @-@ ter , so that parts of your pictures are built , due to the in@@ ability of your camera will begin to consider using the in@@ ability to look into different ros@@ ettes . finally , you can try to re@@ constructed some parts of the missing information from the top . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ w therefore try the missing green and red dots , therefore , this is a question how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; when you select the option , you get the opportunity to set a level . this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted individually for each image . &quot;
&quot; Set the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ee according to your taste . you probably have to put it a bit higher than the default 1 . but this can also be made later in the picture options of the &amp; digi@@ .@@ image processing ; to keep the time for the hum@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed more conservative . &quot;
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorith@@ m is a digital image process to obtain a complete picture from the partial load sensor which provides many cameras and that a matrix of colour is available . this algorith@@ m is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ eder .
&quot; and digi@@ w came to you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m of the D@@ cra@@ w ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colour devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can put the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction correction , as it is performed during the trial . &quot;
a profile translated the color information and returns instructions like this again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ came ; information such as the far@@ bin@@ ders translate from a color tree in the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior issues when a picture is opened in image processing / colour module with raw files .
&quot; color profile folder you set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &quot;
setting the ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour@@ ing view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or ar@@ g@@ ish . here are just your pictures colour and not the whole screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be used to the camera model and model you use . not all profiles are included in the same way . currently there are some , such as Canon , which do not have color ton@@ ed or gam@@ mak@@ e@@ ered . currently , this means that you have to perform the colour mapping . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the soft @-@ proof profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very satisfied , instead of leaving yourself on the blind algorith@@ m of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile for them is provided . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . &quot;
&quot; the Canon series extension makes the style designed for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . it &apos;s an interface used by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; sculp@@ tor and image material support ; many modules support that have been written to cooperate with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select that you want to use , and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ command for tasks , which are carried out by modules , can be set in the menu under settings short @-@ command . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slides@@ how should be easy to understand . the upper shelf l@@ ates the time between the pictures , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other hang@@ ings turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata respectively , which finishes at the lower end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; camera properties show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side , a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to use a camera , switched on the computer , and in the image mode . below are the portals , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage devices . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage am@@ era from the camera box . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / remo@@ vable , on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; fell ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer to switch it into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out whether or she came ; the camera is automatically recognis@@ able . if not , you can set camera dell and port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can choose any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confirmation dialog for the moving of &gt; pictures in the tum@@ ours , you can indicate the discussion of &amp; digi@@ ous ; in the delet@@ ing of a photo in an album . in the sections delete a photo and del@@ e@@ tion of an album you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used , if you use the option changes to the right side bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to apply changes to the button changes . &quot;
you can also under@@ pin the display of the welcome screen &amp; digi@@ tization ; this acceler@@ ates up under the start @-@ up process of &amp; digi@@ tization ;
&quot; the setting Bei@@ m start searching for new photographs &amp; digi@@ came ; the base folder after a new or deleted albums / photos came to look . this extended the start @-@ time of &amp; digi@@ tised , asking if something out of the base folder was deleted , asking &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; you if it shall delete it from the base . &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can be selected under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs are listed below :
&quot; these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for you , please find more information about this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pres@@ ent ; contains a quick picture editing with a few basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correction and improvement . image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image , or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the application advertisements / editing . &quot;
the picture editing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ .@@ They are therefore not part of your distribution . further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be set up in section imaging .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , magni@@ fier and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
&quot; editing functions of image processing changes your photos . however , the original photo is to change before you save it or the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
so you should ev@@ ate a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file Save as required .
&quot; as long as you don &apos;t have saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the menu File , or the button re@@ opening the image processing re@@ producing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last entry . &quot;
almost any action of the image processing can be und@@ one or recovered . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting from editing or re @-@ produced by selecting editing retri@@ eved from the menu .
&quot; if you often use this , you should make yourself the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z for the back and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to realize . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the back@@ sliding or re @-@ button in the tool@@ bar one moment push longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between , and restored or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you started editing the picture editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image down or the entries in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
&quot; you can in the photo , and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar , or the entries in the safest menu . &quot;
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button on the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically select &quot;
&quot; view screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view , in which you use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can view this in the setup dialog by &amp; digi@@ . you can view this from the call ; main window , see the section for setting the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the picture image and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust here the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; out of the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sets . whole image damage can choose from your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window came ; the main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available , even in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is displayed : &quot;
multi@@ f@@ aches Click on the same rider makes the side@@ bar appearing back or disappear into the edge .
&quot; in the hall@@ mark view , you can enter signs with unlimited size or insert . note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are permitted in EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support ASC@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are shaped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC coating field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented , you either use the button or change the next image , the signs are then stored . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the apply button , there is one button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . but this is also performed when you choose a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written in the pictures . &quot;
the review indicates a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in addi@@ ctions or using the short@@ cut Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . the rating from the side@@ bar is always applied only to one picture . to assess several pictures at the same time , select this and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the sampling vision shows a search box to the fil@@ tering of the key@@ word , the key@@ note tree and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; digi@@ tization ; -@@ session submitted . &quot;
the key@@ note tree is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the given search word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering into a picture series . if you have entered different key@@ word , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
key@@ word can also be set by brand of the corresponding an@@ kreu@@ z@@ felder in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored into the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; when multiple images are selected in the main view and you can select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this is only shown on the whole selection , if you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ note section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar with their album , - fil@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and search@@ able views are used , only the intersection of these two are displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop down . suppose you have selected several images in order to put you with key@@ word . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar . then a dialog you ask if you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example shows the main window the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is reduced to No images , which was selected with Str@@ g + a , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ ed tree were pulled up and stored there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched separately below settings .
&quot; if you have a rule and created and find that it should be one or its , you can easily change this with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The entry where the database is sear@@ ched for . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word term , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify a Ex@@ tended search on all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the an@@ cruci@@ fix@@ ture at the end of the rule and after that the button group@@ ing to use . the options can be seen as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I used it mainly to &amp; digi@@ ess ; s concrete implementation adapted .
&quot; the reason why you use a colour@@ ful work@@ flow , that the colors will have the colors available from your camera or scanner . with a colour@@ ful work@@ flow , you can reach that the colors will print on your monitor from your camera or scanner , and the colours you print out of your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the theme is coming on color management , then everyone wants to know what buttons he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you adequate background information about color management . in addition , you will provide you with more information about color management . in addition , you can make links with deeper information enable you to make your own informed decisions . &quot;
&quot; if your work@@ flow meets all of the criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to take care of color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum . ( further information can be found below )
&quot; their only other images added by e @-@ mail or the Web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB does so well work and life for all so easy , why should you use another color room and thus have to make thoughts on colour bl@@ ur@@ g ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB in comparison to colours we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ hoe @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , then visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click Info and then on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum or not , you must have your monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ tish , since s@@ R@@ GB makes it clear to your monitor . if you &apos;re working as in the Far@@ br@@ aum of s@@ R@@ GB , then you need to use either your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a pass@@ able monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool puts five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual work . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , altern@@ ate and contrast from the menu Cor@@ rigi@@ d Autom@@ atic correction are automatically attemp@@ ting to make the best of your colours . they will be experimenting with these effects , to see which the best in your photo acts . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scal@@ able the lumin@@ ous values over the whole picture , so that the dark@@ est point is as light and the light@@ est point as light as possible without its color sh@@ ady . this function is often a magnetic correction for pictures that are dark or chil@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , this method is transformed the illumin@@ ator of the colors of the chosen picture , so that the hist@@ o@@ grams of the intensity is as flat as possible . sometimes it also achiev@@ es very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that causes some miracle to a picture or it destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automatic shut@@ down : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue canal . you select the dark and bright boundary @-@ tones and j@@ us@@ hes the red , green , and blue @-@ channel channels on the complete hist@@ o@@ grams . &quot;
contrast : this method enh@@ ances the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ usti@@ ble image and can be a good correction for poor photos .
&quot; the white comparison from &amp; digi@@ came , is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white off of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the white down@@ right correction is something limited because of a color @-@ room with 8 @-@ bit per colour is done . if you are able to perform the white image above , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways to fix the correction is better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white @-@ p@@ ic@@ eb@@ radi@@ ator , protected by P@@ aw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . they start it via the menu entry of colours white ab@@ duc@@ ted of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the curtains can be adapted to the size . on the left hand , both the original image and the preview of the target image . if you want to see the original wh@@ ist@@ les straight away , then it is enough to click the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target also has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ el under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ o@@ grams .
&quot; on the right top is shown a hist@@ o@@ graph that dynam@@ ically changed , once you have a parameter . this hist@@ og@@ ram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ees . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on the shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow judicial lets you improve or download the shadows of your photos or tri@@ m . &quot;
&quot; to play an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the colour temperature @-@ pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture show around which to use selected color for the calculation of the color temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white comparison with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ flow indicator increases the colors when more than a shade of the pix@@ els is over@@ exposed .. you will display the combined result in the white display . this is displayed in the preview as r@@ an indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons are saving and store exactly this . every setting of the white balance you set can put it into a text file and load later .
&quot; the button pres@@ ets rel@@ ies all fil@@ tering values back to their standard values and the associated white @-@ neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will be a different photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust here the co@@ di@@ sti@@ ckers per color channel of the mach@@ ined image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding is also needed for high quality pictures , calcul@@ ating time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color ton@@ sils can be performed by the sub @-@ window for the use of color profiles . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles , you can rate the chapter administration . &quot;
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors key correction , and allows you to save your settings at the same time , so that you can always use your settings at the same time , so that you can always use the same correction if your camera or scanner always need the same correction . &quot;
&quot; to correct a very powerful option of correc@@ ting problems is the tool for gr@@ ad@@ ation , that you can find under colors Gr@@ ad@@ ation in the menu . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ tization has been made of you four color effects , a solar effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an Kant@@ en@@ filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical manufacturing , Solar@@ zation was called , even sab@@ ati@@ ans , an effect of the picture was created by the extra light . this had the effect that the light@@ ning areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second light@@ ning . the result was a part neg@@ atively of the picture . this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar control . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the image what chem@@ ically possible is possible . another increase is finally created a negative image , that so does not generate on Fot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of the solar system . the original image is the ( 1 ) and which is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vid filter si@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . he differs from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrast the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it easy to em@@ bell@@ ish many photos .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for an on day@@ light @-@ optim@@ ised colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color during day@@ light and high contr@@ asts . &quot;
the ne@@ on@@ filter si@@ simul@@ ated ne@@ on@@ light to the contr@@ ast@@ ers . the parameters levels controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ating the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ light . with great pictures the filter can be the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the colour contr@@ asting and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can look at the various farms and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation instead of increasing her . all changes you can perform in preview . if Him do the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool Gr@@ ad@@ ation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / gam@@ ma , the tool is perfectly read@@ able to improve the exposure . even if dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of sli@@ der . concrete the three slide below the hist@@ o@@ grams . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graphs of the intensity values , a hist@@ o@@ grams , the active channel or the selected area . under the graphs are three sli@@ ders into which can be cli@@ cked and which can be moved to the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to use it is to move the controller and to pay attention to how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be considered . the preview is dynam@@ ically , according to the settings of the picture , updated . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted if the hist@@ og@@ ram is shown with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera is often domin@@ ating the linear hist@@ o@@ grams of a single pillar is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is useful .
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the top for dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for medium tones , often gam@@ ma values . &quot;
&quot; the three colour pin@@ ks can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically interpret the input values of the shadow , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic de@@ generation . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each section . there are also two regul@@ ators to change the output values as well as in the input values . the com@@ pression of output values can be used for example to create a light image as a background while seeing something different in the foreground .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the data stored in the file system can be saved and later loaded and later the Gimp levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three dy@@ es will use the input values automatically for any shade , medium and sun @-@ tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image to put the input values of the hist@@ o@@ grams for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ous channels . &quot;
&quot; the option of over@@ tones indicators controlled all colour channels to display over@@ loaded pixel and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that is , you will see the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see an example of the judicial handling of the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
Modi@@ fications channel : this selection box allows the channel to enter that is changed by the module :
&quot; besides this cas@@ ket there are two symbols used to change between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures with a digital camera , the linear mode is generated with a constant color , the linear mode generated a broad beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short walk to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds can be corresponding with dark @-@ feed and which the associated image pixel dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; preview the original photos is a red marking to see . if you want to change these mark@@ ings on the area you want to change , a suitable line on the curve is displayed , which is the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down , down to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each bend that you created can hereby be saved in the file system and be loaded later . the file format is the Gimp Kur@@ ven@@ format .
&quot; if you are using this method and the three dy@@ es buttons , automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and solar notes . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the original image to put the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the option of over@@ tones indicators controlled all colour channels to display over@@ loaded pixel . if in more than one channel , you will see the combined result only in the preview , and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photo which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ Canal . Sch@@ atten@@ - and solar @-@ tones was set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the color grad@@ ations of the photo .
the channel mix@@ er is another high @-@ developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of the image processing .
&quot; with the channel out , you can select the color for the hist@@ o@@ grams : this gives you a first reference how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and envel@@ ope . the original area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as comparison of your own rider . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ ram to show you the appropriate color value .
&quot; the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you also activate the option Monoch@@ rome . this is particularly practical , if the channel mix@@ er then enable DAS tool to generate great black @-@ white con@@ versions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Monoch@@ rom , the reduction of a color occurs to a visible smoke which does not appear in the same place in the colour canal . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your Monoch@@ rom conversion thereby in which you can reduce the farms first . &quot;
the stor@@ ing and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mix@@ er setting allows you to save and then load it . the file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
&quot; the option of over@@ tones indicators controlled all colour channels to display over@@ loaded pixel and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that is , you will see the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re@@ formed . the option L@@ umin@@ ancy has been activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always intri@@ gu@@ ing because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography there is black / white a work step , because color pictures can simply be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ ers profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; Grün@@ filter : simul@@ ated a black / white film coating with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenarios and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Grün@@ filter . &quot;
&quot; Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter : simul@@ ated a black / white film coating , with a or@@ derly Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and a@@ erial photos . so much like the 002 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) orange juice . &quot;
rot@@ ect : simul@@ ated a black / white film coating with a red Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light to day@@ time . so much like the 00@@ 3 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
&quot; yellow @-@ filter : simul@@ ated a black / white film @-@ coating with a yellow @-@ tone filter , and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Gel@@ b@@ filter . &quot;
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces hot bright and medium tones as it adds a bit cold in the shadow of a print and the re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture .
&quot; adding a texture to your picture , whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop Art portrait out of enlarged points or like a wall @-@ image on a wall . the menu @-@ yield image texture can be used for it . &quot;
Rel@@ ief : move this parameter to the right increases the proportions of the deep or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper writer is applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and this changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not easy task . an opportunity to keep its attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stream eye . under picture frame the module can be started from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter set the desired Rah@@ ment@@ yp for your image . with a thin line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce , it embr@@ aces with a thin line and a broad frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , bad@@ ges it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button @-@ dimensional and decorative fits a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : sets the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width varies from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this with the frame paint finish will be greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ att@@ ed text into an image at any place . this also goes to several places when you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use the image size , orientation , color from the color size and the character set . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ clear background . already , the picture is ready . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool St@@ ones you can apply a template on a picture .
the menu picture template used in the image processing can be used to place sten@@ cils over a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should be adding with maximum com@@ pression ( 9 ) to decre@@ asing the file size of the sten@@ cil . if you want to add an e @-@ mail to the file size of the sten@@ cil . if you want to add an e @-@ mail in English ; position addresses , came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil with the button base folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be painted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the limb@@ s has been set for the sten@@ cils , which reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder , the selection of a folder is updated the sp@@ read@@ ings of the sten@@ cils . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fier and position of your image . &quot;
enlarge The button enlarged the dar@@ ling picture . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse kno@@ b .
&quot; smaller : this button wast@@ ed below the lower picture . in case you want to apply the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must reduce the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired location .
use OK when you want to apply the template on your image . the picture is then adapted to automatic size .
&quot; once came , three different tools are available for grinding . each of you has advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ k is a traditional tool with sharp@@ ness . it is very fast and easy , but generates particularly in dark areas , gran@@ ting images . &quot;
Un@@ shar@@ fe @-@ mask works at the contrast of the edges to leave a picture sharp@@ ly . indeed it &apos;s not working as psych@@ ovis@@ ual Dun@@ es . you can use it to make atmospheric Dun@@ es and it is here a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gimp and he is protected by Win@@ ston Chang .
&quot; re@@ vis@@ ing is possibly the best of the three , since he really improved the sharp@@ ness . he is a little more complicated in its use and has several parameters for adaptation . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because of the digit@@ alization process colors with only minimal differences . this in turn leads to a common colour . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points will be printed on paper . SLR cameras will normally need more thought@@ fully sharp@@ ly as normal cameras for the private user .
&quot; in JP@@ EG pictures , a camera is used to apply internal sharp@@ ly . pictures in the raw format , however , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during the processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner now turn a sharp@@ ness , already during the read@@ able of the picture . if you dis@@ able these dis@@ abling , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by using a photo with the shar@@ k work@@ ings . this allows you to call with the menu entry of the item . &quot;
&quot; but you should do with caution , since the results are not very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also reinforced the noise . in general , the need for the sharp@@ ness of an image increases the tool of chor@@ us . you can get further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharp@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ ly . the solution , the image is a little soft to record , is much easier than it shar@@ pen@@ ed . use the tool for sof@@ ten@@ ing with the menu entry and experiment something with settings . the pres@@ ump@@ ster on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter bl@@ ur mas@@ k@@ ieren is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help you edit the picture . the pres@@ ump@@ ster shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values create very good results and should first try out . an increase in the radius or the amount enhance the effect . if you create the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing mask , the noise and the impression of Gr@@ ates in the vicinity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius poses one of how many pixels are affected by the filter by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ ators . they should therefore sharp@@ ens pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image one of the original is added . this makes the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
&quot; the swelling value is a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and to apply difference amount . this way , one can distinguish a minimum difference between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing from the shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore fl@@ aw in coun@@ ters , He@@ els and water@@ front surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ k@@ filter filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ k@@ ling was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a spon@@ ge = 0.0 . &quot;
that &apos;s what came ; tools Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ze is focused on an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used to be protected by copyright protected de@@ hydr@@ ation filter algorith@@ m of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to create a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focuss@@ ing quot ; in which it is a better approach than just trying to raise the photo . it uses the use of an un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing mask . it is used to start the use of an un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing mask . you can start it out of the menu by opening colors re@@ vocation in the image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular F@@ altung is working much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the original pixel which depends far from the original pixel . the fl@@ aw of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ ean F@@ altung is most often influenced by the remote pixel . this causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular F@@ altung . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images the default value is worth 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red but then on Heiligen@@ vou@@ chers .
cor@@ relation : a increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 b &amp; eg ; 0.95 and m@@ um . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
&quot; smoking filter : a increase in smoking filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 % rarely . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will still consume the image further . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your in@@ sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß is . in most cases , you should use this value to zero to avoid shar@@ pen@@ alized art@@ ef@@ acts . if you raise a value un@@ equal to zero , you might also have to raise the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ h@@ filter filter . &quot;
&quot; mattress size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ational at@@ rix . an increase in mattress size can generate good results , especially if you select great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow if you select great values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the stor@@ ing and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ fraction parameters that you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try all audi@@ ences , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you modify the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later left un@@ pleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you can read and com@@ press pictures , eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ com@@ pressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ cot better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be causing the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ cot a larger neighborhood being used as a shar@@ k . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , it does not have to remove bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ k@@ ron@@ eous masks . even under optimal conditions , it can never be the effect of the dis@@ advantages . for the Vien@@ n@@ IR filter is always at least as good as the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask . the F@@ IR filter is often better in the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected ; this picture was made with an an@@ alogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto @-@ focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator smooth@@ es the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of the area of the ab@@ rup@@ t@@ ted to generate a natural gro@@ ove .
&quot; color tin@@ te allows an adapted color for the pl@@ ile . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot;
the tool sculp@@ tor is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired art@@ ef@@ acts with an unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorith@@ m was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as star@@ points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to use the filter settings f@@ einer , you can use the rider smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail preser@@ v@@ ation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a equ@@ itable smooth@@ ing over the image . a value of 0,@@ 9 should receive details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing are needed . &quot;
jud@@ gement Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value is even@@ ly in all directions while a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gr@@ itt or C@@ CD Rau@@ ries will produce a high value shaft similar patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best eliminated with a value near 1 .
&quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smooth@@ ing factor over all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . Set this value to the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ ps : returns to how often the algorith@@ m is running . normally , here 1 or 2 . &quot;
&quot; wind @-@ gradual entry da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha chosen is chosen , it should also be small for a long term . you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integr@@ ally st@@ ep@@ width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ ally st@@ alls in Pix@@ o . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid Sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never bigger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More about quality that you receive by selecting this option is minimal . he doubled but the term . we recommend it to leave him .
the buttons are saving and store exactly this . every setting of image errors can hereby be saved into a text file and then be loaded again later .
&quot; image error correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take very long and a high CPU load to move . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button waste . &quot;
below you can see how pic@@ ks can be removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is placed on a photo that was caused in Guatemala city with an an@@ alogue camera . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the original image is under ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tization has come ; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image screw . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filter to remove spots and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens , which can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or fashion ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information on sensory cable cameras , so you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screens@@ hot top shows a typical scene which has been done with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ulated smoking that can be removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings may remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can managed the picture . the area specified by the radius is moved across the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus put minor errors . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controlled the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ ed beam . this value sets the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ ort the filter comes to the front . if it is raised , the adap@@ tive filter filter can be changed . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter graphic details can no longer get and smokers should go back . &quot;
edges : controls the cant@@ onal for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the fil@@ tering . if it is too strong it can not be removed the whole smo@@ kes or smokers can occur . put it on a value close to the max@@ im or JP@@ EG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts want to remove it without any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the illumin@@ ance intoler@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either color or illumin@@ ant to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process by the details of the settings .
color : controls the color intoler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you either color or illumin@@ ant to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process by the details of the settings .
&quot; Gamma : controlled the gam@@ mat@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas , which are typically ampli@@ fied to increase . however , he also lubric@@ ates the atten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the judiciary control of the phosph@@ or shock absorption . this value is defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is respon@@ sive , if it is lifted up , the edges and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear on the edges . he can remove smo@@ kes and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save and load : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters used for smokers , which you have set can be stored into the file system and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how noise reduction your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) , and this correc@@ tive with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ ly for your purpose . the solution , the image is a little soft to distinguish , fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ k . use this tool for sof@@ ten@@ ing with the menu entry and experiment with the smooth@@ est . the pres@@ ump@@ ster on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease pic@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very good adapted to remove the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ stag , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ch@@ art@@ ef@@ acts and local mistakes which takes place in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images which makes the content like it also the human eye . &quot;
the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and textures . the algorith@@ m for restoration was carried out by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ rich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
JP@@ EG art@@ ef@@ acts : the com@@ pression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss of com@@ pression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts that are to be seen in un@@ com@@ pressed painting . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons are saving and store just this . every setting of photo restoration is hereby saved into a text file and will be loaded back later .
&quot; photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take very long and a high CPU load to move . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with equ@@ ali@@ mig@@ es smoking is being restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO was recorded . you can see the in@@ famous film compounds on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correc@@ t@@ ted under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old paint photo which was used with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were created by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ ev@@ ill@@ um@@ ination and the Fot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the scor@@ pixel came ; tool hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixel of photos that have been to remove with a C@@ CD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixel are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem as many cameras with JP@@ EG com@@ pression over a built @-@ in repression for hot pixel . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel &quot; ; on a photo with a dark sub@@ tr@@ ance method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file into the assistant with the button dark picture . the tool is fully detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you &apos;ll find the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by using C@@ CD Def@@ ects .
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark picture to this image . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard is noted the last dark picture , and this will automatically return to the next meeting . &quot;
the image area and the P@@ review will help you to correct the result in the image . the pres@@ ump@@ ster shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all of the following areas .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method for this pix@@ el@@ blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; thir@@ sts : it will be an average of the neighboring pixel . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels which have a gap of 1 from Pix@@ el@@ block will be drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default language method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less for Pix@@ el@@ block will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is used to inter@@ pol@@ l the pixels in the block .
&quot; Kub@@ o : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are de@@ duc@@ ted to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ ator surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) , or a group of Cub@@ an cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block . &quot;
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction to a color photo from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive image is under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the call came ; Vign@@ a correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gr@@ ading , i.e. sub@@ ver@@ ated corners , one image . &quot;
&quot; fores@@ aw lenses , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often be the whole sensor area not even@@ ly illumin@@ ate . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ animal quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by putting the light to the sensor there . Tele@@ objective conditions can also show that behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many Center filters require a factor in 1.5 or 2 in aper@@ ture filter , which should not make it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . fores@@ aw , even with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed effects may arise by motion . &quot;
&quot; with the large se@@ aling divisions of today &apos;s filter and the color @-@ room type of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ filter by an equivalent distribution using a Center@@ filter on an image . the algorith@@ m is copy@@ right@@ ed by John Walker . &quot;
with three regul@@ ators you can control the fine @-@ correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption on the point of the biggest density of the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , what an optical filter with a Bl@@ ending setting of 1 , or by chance to compens@@ ate a greater degree of Vign@@ a , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the mach@@ ining of an image with the vi@@ et@@ ti@@ ze correc@@ tions reduces the lumin@@ osity of the target image with these options . you need to provide only positive values as you only need to increase settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to be a fin@@ er rein@@ forcement of the target image , let the values for the lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the Gr@@ ad@@ ation from the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing out of the menu color Gr@@ ad@@ ation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vign@@ a correction correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the fine image in the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ tive image . a lumin@@ ous and contrast @-@ correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tization has been a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
&quot; this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colored lock@@ ings can not be corrected using this tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient of the second Gr@@ ades treated the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ exe form of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third Gr@@ ades has a similar round @-@ effect , fl@@ acht , but in the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth Gr@@ ades corrected the distant corners opposed to that of the second Gr@@ ades . if you combine these two can be eliminated almost any geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion .
&quot; generally , this value is controlled the strength of the distor@@ tion second Gr@@ ades . with negative values can be corrected , and positive values of kis@@ sing cor@@ rup@@ tions . &quot;
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the wheel . this value works stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter set the same sign of the parameter .
z@@ oom : this value scal@@ ates the size size and thus leads a correction of the first Gr@@ ades through . negative values enlarge while positive the picture is smaller .
&quot; light : this value , the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustr@@ ates the dialog with a preview the distor@@ ting correction . the values you use for your image , are stored and used next start as standard values . &quot;
the T@@ acks or counter @-@ shaped correction should be carried out in front of all cuts or size changes . at the best you perform this correction as all the first . if you make a picture new to cut and after that a ton@@ ic correction would perform the effect evi@@ dently the wrong .
&quot; to help you find the best correction is available to show you this tool a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the T@@ onn@@ ade / counter @-@ shaped twi@@ light with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you want to correct a counter @-@ shaped twi@@ light , the resulting picture black corners will have . you can transform them with the cutting edge tools in the menu , cut out of the image processing or over the z@@ oom reg@@ ler of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives such as shots from the front , frame and paintings it is the perspective to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the T@@ onn@@ ical correction is applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) , and the correc@@ tive image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the algorith@@ m is based on a method to simul@@ ate infr@@ a movie by the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org website which can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ i@@ at@@ ure@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below P@@ review you can simul@@ ate two parameters for watching films and movie sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to simul@@ ate the cre@@ ws of a highly sensitive film . the ISO reg@@ ler changes the amount of film compounds and domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; because the filter channels to reproduce the reproduce of infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the far@@ bin@@ ders are missing . &quot;
this is an example of infr@@ ared cinem@@ as applied to a country photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image under ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher standard values create a kind of au@@ ra in the cutting .
&quot; the review came ; filter film gr@@ itt is a simple using tool to reproduce the film cre@@ ase on your images , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to enhance the sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturers mix great silver @-@ gran@@ ting of the photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the movie body @-@ effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ ud photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the gran@@ ular@@ ity . the standard value is , although commonly higher values needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you still need more bodies , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film container to a black / white image applied . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined the ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity to ISO @-@ 1600 .
&quot; the dra@@ in came , filter oil painting , generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter oil painting , gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature and lac@@ tation are good for this effect . &quot;
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better suited for large images . smooth@@ es controlled the smooth@@ es or , from the other side view , the hing@@ es . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and that worked with the ( 2 ) . Pin@@ ch size for this 640 pixels big picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter coal drawing used color and intensity size to create a carbon@@ ate in the drawing , are stressed . pictures of their gra@@ dient is therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful when you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top regul@@ ator cho@@ oses the foundation size and the lower j@@ us@@ ts the contrast ( smooth@@ es ) .
this is an example of the coher@@ ent filters . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result may be further improved by adaptation of the intensity .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was put in wax . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the Not@@ ving was a fast tool to give your pictures again with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , where colour is not the most important thing about the content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a gray @-@ gray landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to set the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving fil@@ tering . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of cr@@ ush @-@ effects . it uses copy@@ right@@ ed algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and makes it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 is distor@@ ted the image here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the kno@@ b .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects . it uses copy@@ right@@ ed algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom Un@@ shar@@ fe : get the picture along the stern@@ sing lines running from a centre . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ shar@@ fe : caught the image by rotation of the pixels by a focal point . this simul@@ ates the dis@@ advantages of a revol@@ ting camera .
removal bl@@ ur@@ fs : caught the picture to create the effect of a not focused camera lens . the object seems to come back in the background .
&quot; movement of movement : caught the image through horizontal motion of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a linear movements , z : B : from a car or train photographic , camera . &quot;
sof@@ ten@@ ing un@@ lock : w@@ aking the image soft to the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
&quot; sho@@ ok , bl@@ ur@@ red the image through random shift of the pixels and simul@@ ates the dis@@ advantages of a arbitr@@ ary moving camera . &quot;
intelligent dis@@ advantages : finds the farms in the picture and caught these without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can therefore stop this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
the reg@@ rop@@ es are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . this gives it natural your images a n@@ ap look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m .
tro@@ pics size allows the size of the drop to change . as the tro@@ pics size does not automatically grows with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and the density of drops . fish stocks changes the optical effect of drops in the picture .
&quot; you can hold the area free of rain drops . use the tool to select the area , for example a face , which should remain free . if you start off the filter rain drops , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain drops . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through mir@@ rors or turning into the correct orientation . the tools can be transformed in the menu and transform or transform mir@@ rors . &quot;
&quot; photo sho@@ cks is definitely one of the most advanced tools , in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality . &quot;
&quot; a picture to shr@@ inks an image is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture above , and how can you get a picture zo@@ oming ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorith@@ m of which is used here , makes it a good work . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . select size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for the size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool . &quot;
many sculp@@ ting programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation for example Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ ess ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m photo was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
you have to say the tool you want to change the size as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the new size of the page ratio is maintained in the original size of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons are saved as and store are used exactly for this . each entry for photo can be saved as text file and be loaded back later .
&quot; photo sho@@ cks is very fast with what it does , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load to move . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
&quot; you can see below an example of picture above , by clicking a small color picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlar@@ ging standard . &quot;
&quot; cut a photo is not only a frequent surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . the image processing allows this very simple . to cut a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rect@@ angle , then you will see the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you want to release the mouse button again , the area of the photos is cut off . you can change the size of the area . you can create the size of the right area by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle , you can simply click with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting @-@ section , use the button &quot; &quot; kno@@ b button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file save or save it from in the menu file to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the spect@@ ator area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by shift the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool after aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format it is always assigned to the greater value of height and in the cross @-@ format of the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you can use inches , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see a list of traditional sizes for Fot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to center the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; below in dialog , you can use the Max . ratio of the area to cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tik@@ al ) , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image measurements are reflected in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the cro@@ pped image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the assem@@ bling assistance enable you to bl@@ ink , so that you can put your images better together . these help are : &quot;
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic ponds are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ reg@@ ains , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles towards the di@@ agon@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Golden center : the golden middle is a division which is on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy , or the bl@@ ush blades of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Golden partition is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used in the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temple and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number leads from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is following 1 equal to the sum of their two previous numbers . a composition that is normally follows as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the golden middle presents fluid @-@ lines if you put a picture together . these help are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photographs . compared to third @-@ reg@@ el the golden spiral leads to the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical river .
&quot; a further rule is called the rect@@ angle of golden spiral , as well as golden bow@@ ls . it should be something that the eye can be in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can just be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the gol@@ fing tri@@ angles are also guided from the top of the golden spiral paths . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of golden tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not a tiny tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ als can be placed on these lines can be a st@@ ati@@ an object of dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles make use of your frame . try to place an effect of professional photo@@ grap@@ hen dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image material on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that can &apos;t be reached differently .
the options horizont@@ ally reflect and twi@@ sts can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic pond .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . this way you can custom@@ ize the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to turn a picture to rot@@ ate any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you can &apos;t drive the camera exactly ver@@ tically or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things got around an angle . select this with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; imaging and the tool select free rotation , and turn the way@@ angle . &quot;
rot@@ ate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can put the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the Module Free rotation is a horizontal and a vertical line at your disposal . move the mouse c@@ ursor in the picture to fix the two lines . now , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now see the angle like in the previous section . &quot;
once you filmed a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to transform this feature trans@@ forming out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function Autom@@ atic cutting . select one of the following options :
the option Anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . but take note of the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed to a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information which help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty sections created by the transformation into pixel . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty sections created by the transformation into pixel . &quot;
angle on the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle on the left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adaptation of the perspective the picture is a little wast@@ ed . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
after you &apos;ve adapted the perspective you get un@@ joyful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way of getting this is the picture with transform@@ ers cut out of the picture editing .
&quot; the tool @-@ tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . it is not rotation , the picture is dec@@ eived . in other words , a rect@@ angle becomes transformed into a parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . you can transform this module about transform . &quot;
&quot; drag your image by using the horizont@@ als angle and the vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and vertical at the same time . if you push to pres@@ ets , the angle will appear on zero . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the screen . &quot;
&quot; for your help a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool @-@ tool to use your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the Sh@@ ear , the picture becomes a bit tired . for a single shift this effect is usually neglected , but two f@@ uses twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ging and hence you should avoid this . &quot;
after the cas@@ ing the picture has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is the picture with transform@@ ers cut out of the image processing .
&quot; once came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to indicate a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F among them . &quot;
&quot; once came ; only files in formats used to know . this happens from the file extension and a comparison of this with a defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it &apos;s going to change the file in image processing . you can change this list of file extensions . in the configuration configuration you can find more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to select even the use format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fied ; supports both formats .
com@@ pression is the use of data com@@ pression to digital pictures . there are redund@@ ant information reduced to this way the image data can be stored on an efficient way .
&quot; in general , JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , gl@@ atter@@ ing results as JP@@ EG by the same com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism . the 200@@ 0s version can also be saved , if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the pipe format , then you can read more about the pipe format and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw imaging of &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization ; . &quot;

&quot; all imaging tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , smo@@ kes , bl@@ aming , bl@@ ur , bl@@ ur , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialogue type , which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applications ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress report shows the status of the filter at the current picture . links from him allow five buttons to change the compar@@ ative smo@@ dus of the precau@@ tions . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected area .
horizontal sharing with no dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the range below the selected tip area .
vertical parts . the left area shows the original and the right to the effect of the filter .
horizontal divide . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the preview , if the mouse is not in the screen , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show over and under@@ age . the colours can be adapted to the general setup site .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of P@@ review . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and on the part of the picture you want to see . preview in the left part of the dialogue will immediately be updated .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings vary from the last use of the module .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data if they are available .
this tab puts an intuitive navigation tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ Programme . you can fil@@ tered with the mouse or out zo@@ oming or it and move it . move it while you are fil@@ tered with the mouse button . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this sets up your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ et files . the application can be used for mach@@ ining of color pal@@ ettes and to choose and use nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files , which are of &amp; k@@ de ; installed , can either apply for the whole system or just a user . in the latter case they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and permitted colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , they can select from a list of the installed pall@@ ets or browse the files . &quot;
the c@@ ursor is displayed in the pall@@ et view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the color next to it . the color is described below the pall@@ et view . here you can also change the color name .
&quot; it can also be used to pick out . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the c@@ ursor . then move the mouse with penet@@ rated lin@@ ker mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the An@@ cruci@@ fix@@ ture Bei@@ m is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted in the c@@ ursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode you can set by selecting the check@@ box under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can together with the actions copying , cut and insert . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color follows three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color @-@ name , followed by a row @-@ line character , if another color follows , can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; included . &quot;
the colors in the range and the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then select in the color selection on the left side .
&quot; &amp; cut@@ ters ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ dot ; graphs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , in particular in inform@@ atics . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program to visu@@ alise graphics ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with just a few features . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; graphical viewer &quot; &quot; project has set itself the aim of replacing these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical user interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; none . &quot;
&amp; cut@@ ters ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph ; displays graphics with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graphs in &amp; Kate ; represents the graph new and depic@@ ted in &amp; cut@@ ters ;
menu to open the graphs in &amp; Kate ; or to open the graphs in &amp; cut@@ l@@ viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; component to open
&quot; load of big graphs ( currently , there are problems with approximately 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these knots ) &quot;
&quot; further required software : &amp; cut@@ ters ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs are required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window indicates the opened graphics , each in its own sub@@ window . in the beginning , if you start &amp; cut@@ ters ; in this case the tool@@ bar opened only the symbol file and the ( blank ) list is opened , click on the first symbol to display the dialog file . &quot;
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files the main window looks like in the bottom screens@@ hot :
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the string . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; mouse wheel use ( high and r@@ under no special , left and right at penet@@ rated &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has just been altered in &amp; cut@@ ters ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h should be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change , so that later , you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item settings k@@ graph@@ viewer ; see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph@@ ite box outside of a running &amp; cut@@ aneous viewer : eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; graphical graphics in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the tool dialog . &quot;
&quot; in the program start , you can re @-@ leave all graphics of your last session . again , you can save your choice both and later change . &quot;
&quot; you can also define how the Grap@@ h should be divided into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely . &quot;
&quot; if you use multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs are to be placed on this page . in doing so , the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graphs . &quot;
page views with one on several pages shared with no head@@ line and with another ty@@ pe@@ writer
&quot; the page once again loading is possible to set the behaviour when a file has changed on hard disk , eg course ; from another program . you can specify a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program each time . &quot;
&quot; the page opening gives the possibility to set the behaviour of &amp; cut@@ ters ; you can set a default behavior for this case ( graphs in a new window , or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is asked . &quot;
&quot; the site administration is the opportunity to set the start @-@ up of &amp; cut@@ ters ; you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last meeting or not ) , or determine when they were asked for . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; will open further options : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries as they are on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the standard for previous graphs . he produces hierarch@@ ical or cur@@ ated represent@@ ations of court graphs . the algorith@@ m lays down the edges in the same direction ( from top to right ) and then try to produce as short edges and as few cant@@ een as possible . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ just graphs . he produces depic@@ tions in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ board . it is used the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorith@@ m that is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .

the K@@ IP@@ I module can read images and provide tools to invite new images and to record them .
&quot; this module can be used to invite new images to log out of external sources , and to release them . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
images sc@@ ans : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner which supports through the SAN@@ E project or another source such as video streams . so that this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SAN@@ E installed .
if you open the menu entry images appear a dialog that allows you to choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source of which you want to pick the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace your image corresponding to select your image carefully before you check the image carefully before you check with the button scanning the picture . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; note that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings otherwise possibly cannot be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you have pushed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan finished and the window to fix the options of the target file . here you can select the com@@ pression and type of image file . here you can also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by the image . &quot;
screens@@ hot you can create after you choose the menu of Im@@ por@@ - &gt; screens@@ hot ... selected . a window appears in which you can set the different screens@@ hot of the screens@@ hot :

the module Ex@@ por@@ ters to Flick@@ r can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flick@@ r server in the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will use the process of generating a Tok@@ ens . thus , it is used for your authentic@@ ation . it is therefore virtually your ID to Flick@@ r . a browser is started , so that you can register with Flick@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to Flick@@ r website . you will be presenting the following page after a successful login . &quot;
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you pressed on Yes you get the dialog to upload photos to Flick@@ r . this is displayed in the next section .
&quot; if the module is started to Flick@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialogue , which shows the current access allow@@ ances which shows the module . the module currently supports no other permission . you will be asked if you wish to continue with these permission . &quot;
&quot; the button photos should be pushed once again after you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload . if you press the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to the Flick@@ r Server . &quot;
the keywords field can be filled with a composite se@@ perate list of words . these are added to the image as a tags during the up@@ loading .
&quot; with the options open , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ e you can adjust the access to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as Private . &quot;
&quot; when you select the option to change the size of the photos from the up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the size of a maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is not changing as the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add GPS co @-@ ordin@@ ates in the met@@ ad@@ ata of an image and edit . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF sampling of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization is available to loc@@ alize pictures geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal and l@@ ati@@ tudes are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track than XML @-@ file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ for@@ mat@@ . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alisation Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to load a possible cor@@ relation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a file file using the GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains the same time at the same time as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file downloaded a automatic cor@@ relation , the coordinates are recorded in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera period needs to be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera @-@ time zone . &quot;
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera . lies the devi@@ ation among them are summ@@ arized the data . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have any sp@@ ur@@ inary data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference between 2000 seconds then will display all images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality , there is a loc@@ ating in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can put it down here and then push the button cor@@ relation to inter@@ pol@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . as the dialogue set off the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set off on the map . select the relevant region and expand it once again , until you have reached a given accuracy . the map must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite view and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang out the GPS data on the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ ve tool used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported to HTML pages , and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will allow U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alisation . &quot;
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . you need to select all albums on the right . you can quickly select a large number of albums on the right . in the area below the Al@@ ben@@ ches and the text is displayed in the head of the HTML page .
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you then click on a picture a new page is opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the picture is displayed directly with your default panel , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show . &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all of your related images . select a folder on which you have at your right . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ dle Export that contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ Information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color @-@ depth , you can change the default depth . this also influences the file size . all other settings are explained . &quot;
&quot; the rider images allows you to select some of the settings from the album rider for the spect@@ ators , which are small pictures shown in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press to break down the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically be closed . you can therefore install the programmer . the web browser is automatically started at the end to view the preview of the gallery . press Connect to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I sculp@@ tor is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to look at pictures .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I sculp@@ tor makes it possible to see a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as la@@ wns , zo@@ oming or rel@@ oc@@ ating . the observer can be used for quick imaging and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed by default in a full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG sub @-@ free module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allow it to save for the actions listed below , images in JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses for quality or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
the consequence of the faul@@ t@@ free storage is it the file size increases since no com@@ pression of color information is taking place . this can be seen as well as the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital cameras is a tool that allows you to connect to your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ ad@@ ata Editor currently does not have documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mail@@ ing@@ liste k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import -@@ function of met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the import function and call it the file op@@ tionally with which you want to copy the screen image . the data will be copied , after which you pushed into the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all images formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not to write in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check out exi@@ ve 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a series of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slides@@ how .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG @-@ video , using a defined length , using a defined length , using a defined length . you can also add a audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the slides@@ how . &quot;
all images will automatically select to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition you can create a wall@@ paint for the slides@@ how . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
&quot; you must first select the images that will be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can create the module using extras . &quot;
the images selected by you are then en@@ umer@@ ated under image files in the portfolio . there you can also modify sor@@ ting the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; once you are satisfied with your list , you should custom@@ ize the other settings . the video format can choose from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds which will display a picture below . a lower value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot;
the wall@@ et can be set next set . in doubt you should leave them black . the name and path of the generated file can be set up under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep in mind the end with the extension .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , you can start with the button Ko@@ ding the generation of the movie . depending on the speed of your b@@ illing , you can go to a coffee or enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slides@@ how once you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages about the button to the right below . &quot;
the print assistant allows you to print several pictures on a sheet of paper along with standard photo@@ sizes . these combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to print you or print with the Gimp module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your images in one of three formats , JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line @-@ tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original concept of Him is : expect you from d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera model . sometimes you get better results ! &quot;
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w image conver@@ ters appears then in the mode for a single image . with the button P@@ review you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now optimize the values new to optimize the adjustment process . the first option is to determine whether the camera settings for the white is to be used . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour / GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use the double information . if your camera is working in the R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the converting results . JP@@ EG uses an abandoned algorith@@ m and produces for the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the tag@@ ged Image format , T@@ IF@@ F , maintains all the information of your image and uses the free L@@ Z@@ W com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to edit your images frequently or you later continue to use the JP@@ EG format , since it is limited a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ating . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG as a memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata are contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process , you can break down . &quot;
&quot; the stack mode allows you to convert different images at once . use this mode , so if you are sure , e.g. by testing in a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the settings options are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility of writing existing file automatically . this is helpful in case this is not available in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to squee@@ ze all pictures in one album . it uses the program to convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following picture formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of a album . you can fix the pre@@ fix , the number of number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the time c@@ ach@@ et . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it is used to reduce the image from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can choose the image smaller or enlarge . these four types of picture changes are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size changes in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size changes in two dimensions . this aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not dis@@ proportionate size changes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; print preparation : preparing the image for the photo print . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo model . the target image , including background size , Rand@@ size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images to your prefer@@ ential e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the clear@@ ing images in advance . further pictures can draw on the list of images to sen@@ sing images and place there .
&quot; after you have started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the images selected from you . on the button images add more images . for the last picture , a preview is displayed on the right side . &quot;
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and place it in order to add the list of images to the pictures .
&quot; with the button images , the selected images can be removed from the list of pictures . &quot;
after you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message -@@ window of your e @-@ mail client . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you selected are already attached to the app@@ endi@@ x .
if you don &apos;t want to send out too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the increasing e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and every time it is used until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; following the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments are attached to the images into a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very appropriate to reduce the size of photo@@ files as e.g. T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG , if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality cannot be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; when you select JP@@ EG under pictures file format , and the original files in JP@@ EG format are , then the original extern@@ als will be added to the cutting pictures . &quot;
&quot; when the process is ready , the window is not automatically closed , so you can see the status feed@@ backs , looking for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button push you can sl@@ ey this window ? en . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced slides@@ how , a window will be displayed with questions like your slides@@ how . you can choose between you selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL transitions in the presentation enables very elegant images using OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the slides@@ how will be very slow . &quot;
the option names can be displayed that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images appear in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the sand@@ ing option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then manually ab@@ ort them manually with Es@@ c .
the option pictures can be acci@@ dental that the images are shown in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; under delay between images can be set the temporary distance between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen trans@@ gres@@ s@@ ect . so you should show this out before you show the presentation of your friends ! &quot;
there is more than a dozen transitions between which you can choose . by chance cho@@ oses a different effect in every transition between images .
&quot; during the slides@@ how , you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left screen . move your mouse into this corner to switch off . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slides@@ how . &quot;
&quot; at the left button of the screen , you can see the current data stream , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ cs currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module wall@@ papers is a tool to set a picture as the background image for the work@@ sheet .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your KDE work@@ sheet . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with your photo album ; see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , there are now in each group , so in people , places and in the group key@@ word items . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories , for which you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF @-@ based information , look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current umb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described for yourself . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
if you select another person only the images appear on which both persons are to be seen . through this selection method you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on some individual images .
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view the images to view the pictures of your range . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol before its name . you can save with &amp; photo@@ album ; however , for every person you can store its own image , which is of course also valid for places , key@@ word and other categories that you have defined yourself . see this picture . &quot;
&quot; to display pictures next to the name , select the button on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in this unusual context menu , you can choose which view you can display for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display for example symbols with images of individuals and at the same time a list of key@@ word can be displayed ( if you do not have a suitable pictures ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must define ourselves which image can be displayed for each individual person . now , you can select an image editor , as shown in the picture above , you can custom@@ ize the image factor according to your wishes and thus choose which part of the image should be displayed or cut down . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the entry in the main window , you will see a dialog that is similar to the dialog for the drawing of the picture properties very similar . this dialog can look at the picture once more . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string into the box or descri@@ bing the descriptions or descriptions of the images according to this text , you can also enter a date , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures according to certain names such as you can see in the picture . here , some pictures where Jes@@ per , however , are not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather try to try out the functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and look at the fast entry to the screen and the introductory videos . &quot;
&quot; start your photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , if you start your photo@@ album ; for the first time you start , or select in the menu help the menu entry folder ; -@@ demo . then , some examples are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you see here : . as the name implies , this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then shows a different unit . you can change between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by clicking the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ viewed on the following ways : you can select the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date ) the time @-@ line will always display the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view .
&quot; you can also select an area of the time bar by selecting the mouse button down , and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , thus the sched@@ ules , then drag the dates . you can pick the selection , by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; photo album ; provides you with two ways to create HTML @-@ web pages with your images . the one is integrated into &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module is described ( see ) . in the following part of the user &apos;s manual ( see ) . in the following part of the user &apos;s manual , you can create an integrated version of the HTML menu ... &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages , you must make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and finish . in the following each section is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the survi@@ vor@@ s and a description which is to contain the HTML file later . on top album ; HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; photo@@ album album ; -@@ export file should be created on the overview page . print information about the export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . for example , you can avoid that information from a party . for example , that all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this attitude to hide certain images from certain vie@@ wers . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can specify how the HTML pages are to look like . most of the settings are clearly , why this is not specifically made . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolution solutions for the images . therefore , those who have viewing your website and possess a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images may download for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your side may change the resolution at any time you set up . so , so , you can browse your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , as if he wants to see a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setup area , you place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
best to choose all your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be automatically collected and selected for all future pictures . here you can either select a folder or a of KDE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is displayed for vie@@ wers . if you select a URL for the base folder , the URL , which you select here , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you , you have to manually copy it to the final Target folder . so that the import function , see , correct , you must specify the final destination of the files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are . &quot;
&quot; the currently described setting options apply all three on base folders or URLs . in this , a sub@@ folder created , whose name you define in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a family @-@ party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can of course use HTML @-@ page for viewing the images . if you want to wear a HTML page for viewing the images , so you have to do with &amp; photo@@ album , this work will not even do . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the properties are connected with ex@@ - and import . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . you differ from whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is stored in the file , that you have all pictures attached to the file , but the obvious disadvantage is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the menu file ... or along with HTML @-@ pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file is looking for pictures in two ways . first , it searches the images that are specified in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ Export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the export of pictures described you can export over the menu file ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; with the option Manu@@ ell in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Autom@@ atic you copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images are already com@@ pressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to com@@ press the files . if you want to do this anyway , just select the option export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is max@@ tional image size limit . if you want to send your friends pictures , the .@@ k@@ im file otherwise would be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that every picture can be a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import ... select , becomes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard to the import consists of four steps . first , you have to select which images you want to import , according to which folder the import can be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are called the category people of the import@@ ing file person@@ er ( if you are a dump ) , while this category in your database persons is called . therefore , you are in the third dialog window , which categories are to be imported , and which categories that are to be imported into your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can import the categories of the file to imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and look at : when you see images , one often would like to watch pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the images on which of this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) fixing the information about your pictures , over ( 2 ) the review and view , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adapt@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program to the administration of your pictures , but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but frequently it also closes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; photo album : saves all his information in the index@@ .x@@ ml file at the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file , which you can secure using a program of your choice , e.g. standardization tools , to secure a flo@@ ppy disk or re@@ visions at the CV@@ S . &quot;
&quot; photo album : notice the folder , in which your images are stored and used this on future starting recording . if you want to start another database with images , you can start a different folders ; with the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; over the menu entry settings , photo album ; Set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user &apos;s manual , you will see the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; on the left you see six different symbols , with which you can view settings for the viewing and the options for the viewer . for each setting stands for a detailed help you can access the F1 @-@ button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it has been described in you how to set for each image different features , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; you can see the dialog , which is used to already edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a marking and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories already mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete groups of members , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group , instead of explaining all groups of a member &apos;s membership . &quot;
&quot; in view of the settings options available to you for placing the member groups . with the above selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left @-@ hand window , you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module with other graphic applications such as the K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called through the menu modules . the modules can be described and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help you can call on the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; because the modules are used by several applications in one another , it may be that the modules with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; demo database can always be tested using the demo database . therefore , you should either call this command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say I would not have been war@@ ned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with various applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is an album just a folder . even if &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , this type of order does not support , simul@@ ated it for some modules the order by albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the latest album , which simply matches the current view , so all the images , which shows you the Bilder@@ vor@@ Show currently . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album you have to do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album to the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will have the category that you have specified in the setup dialog as category for virtual albums , will be used for example , for example the category of persons , will do &amp; none album ; so do , so if you have chosen individuals and transmit it to the module . &quot;
&quot; because some modules with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album is not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the range modules which are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you can see an example of a boot screen , as soon as you start your photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , see above a menu - and a tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you see the window , with which you can &apos;t see any information about your pictures . in the section we will look back on this window , but just click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview with all the existing pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with notes . these include information about the persons who have been taken on the picture , where the image can be displayed either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time . if for example , on all pictures of Jes@@ per picture and all the pictures in Copenhagen were taken . &quot;
all these notes may be used for the addi@@ ction and brow@@ sing as you can read in section . if you want to see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
&quot; you will see three lists with a text box by selecting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album , as you will always use it whenever you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is the moving of the images inside the list : if you have a family @-@ party and pic@@ tured on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , so you can find that the names used to be moved upwards , people can find and arrange . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tical view list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting to date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and provide these images with notes . click in this case simply on the front and back buttons , which are located at the top of the picture above . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , for example , with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and provided the menu item . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a summary , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . attention , this puts forward that you just see your categories alphabe@@ tically . see . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the &quot; &quot; di@@ aling &quot; &quot; by removing the ly@@ tic that form the surface of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can also move from a frame also a separate window by drag him outside the window range . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers among other things the possibility to save the current design and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to display this window later , use the button Options ... and here window a / out . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; select the entry pictures show in the browser , you will get an overview with the images of the currently selected images , or all pictures in case you do not have a filter . you can configure the size of the images by simply down the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply . &quot;
&quot; when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as the background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on an image , it is displayed in the picture shows . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture @-@ stand , a new ad center will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can delete images from the pictures , simply select the corresponding pictures from which you want to delete or select in the Edit selection menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use your photo album . you can also use the images stored anywhere , so you do not have to record the images anywhere , so you can &apos;t see the pictures from your photo album . in the picture you see the view of &amp; none photo album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; images , in which the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the images are provided . however , you can view the preview of these images . you can also look at these pictures with the picture above . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function does not need to copy files from folders and again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; support it until now do not want to avoid the submission of the concerned CD . if you want to avoid the one another hard drive to your pictures , please purchase a larger disk in order to store all pictures to it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , fil@@ tering the images so that you may want to see for other in@@ accessible , and click Ref@@ res@@ ellers to see all the images that your small sister may see , cont@@ eu@@ ing and the menu entry all except current view . &quot;
&quot; with this you have set out what pictures in the case of the case should be hidden . if you enter the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu item you have locked , which will be locked out . if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that has to be entered into the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture is not at all very secure . for one , all the images on the hard disk and the other one can access the password as un@@ encrypted text or delete it . this type of password protection serves only to those who are with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to res@@ sing the views of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours so you can describe it at some point of course , that you just want to look at some point . for this reason , you can look at some picture and video looking . this is the preview for you from the preview , as described . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can simply drag and copy what information is displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined , see the browser , see , matching entries to this . if you click Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have chosen individuals from your browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can jump from them before and back by jumping the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slides@@ how . and then a new image can be controlled by clicking the Str@@ g button and Plus or Min@@ us . started and stopped the slides@@ how by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful capability of the beh@@ older of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the whole place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch in full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can get in the picture in and out of the zo@@ oming . for Her@@ oes , you can simply drag a rect@@ angle . with the Min@@ us button , you can get r@@ zo@@ oming The Plus @-@ button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture shows how an z@@ oom rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the image does not be zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ itable key sets the zo@@ oms , so each pixel is in the screen a pixel of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work in videos that are in and out of the zo@@ oming , with the plus and any type key . &quot;
with the rotating functions from the context menu you can rot@@ ate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments about the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forget to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the dialog and configuration dialog of the picture to enter this name . but you might not just drag the image and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to start the viewer with images and highlight them as good or bad while you one at one by one .
&quot; for the two examples above gives you the viewer the possibility to give pictures with features , while you see them . features include the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter . you see an image where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set the characteristics of your pictures , you will be able to print this in your browser . so if you have all pictures you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or what you just want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the view show , then you can add characteristics to the pictures by pressing the letter for the characteristic after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allow you &amp; photo@@ album ; in the picture to paint .
&quot; the tree is not stored with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your mind later . &quot;
&quot; in a picture you can see a picture on the painted album . in order to finish the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then click on the painting painting from the context menu . to finish the painting , just put the cross in the tool@@ bar above on the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; you have to master the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not fully master , but the documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and shown the object in the wire image . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple items simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all the properties are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the item you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following listing is built @-@ down , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
with delet@@ ing either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
&quot; if you have changed properties , click to apply these changes . have invali@@ d values entered . then you can correct a message with a fault description . then you can then click the input window and apply the changes to break up . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ user &apos;s documentation in the tool dialog , you can view the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the indicated object with the help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user &apos;s documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the original view . &quot;
&quot; press review in the property view and a small example of the scene is posted with your chosen texture . as default , the complete texture is displayed , even if you want a sub@@ ordinate element ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the complete texture map ) , cross locally . &quot;
the screens@@ hot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these controls with mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifting . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse over the whole window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a visibility for visibility . you can specify this value relative to the visibility of the higher level of the higher level or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility , or equal to the tool@@ bar of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as a default . the object _ object and view of the object Properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window order , or if you need any other order , you can set it any number . you can also store several window frames and easily switch between different regulations . &quot;
&quot; to add a window above or under a present view , drag the fence to the top or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the anchor to the right or left side of the view . the new view is anch@@ ored on the right hand side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to move more views to each other , drag the fence in the middle of a different view . you can then move between the views through clicking on the cart@@ on cart@@ on top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window order are sound@@ ing views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the fence on the work@@ space or click on the small to the left top of the arrow in the fibre bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the board bar . to prevent the lock , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert extra views into the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any type of views . new views are we@@ aving , you can anchor them to any place . &quot;
the current window view can store you with view window order ... save it . a dialog is displayed where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual was written , was &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the symbol ren@@ dering the symbol ren@@ dering , in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry into cap@@ tion scene . &quot;
&quot; an R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in various image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full screen . &quot;
&quot; click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... select , the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each wheel mode has a name . you can enter any name , however , is a name that can detect the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the cardboard card size , you can enter the width and height of the framed picture . if you only want to ren@@ dering a small area of the picture , select the cross section and enter the image section to ren@@ dering the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the combination field quality , you can select the properties that used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; to ren@@ dering it . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user refl@@ ections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual for &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is thrown with only a beam depending on the pixels , different mistakes can often be created . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è patterns or ste@@ aming effect in cur@@ ves and lines , sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general they see pictures with this feature better .
&quot; when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam of the pixels . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the adjacent pixels is adap@@ tive ; recur@@ sive , because each pixel is repeat@@ ed@@ ely further divided and adap@@ tive because the records depend on the selected color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a beam of pixels . if the difference between colour values set off with super @-@ sampling . if you set the low value on 4 extra points , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be charged with a low value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams each pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixel will be calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between colour values exc@@ eeds the threshold , the pixels will be divided into 4 sub@@ pixel which will continue to be pursued further and further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the records can be adjusted with the low @-@ level . &quot;
&quot; another option to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the production of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn J@@ it@@ tering , altered &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular examples . &quot;
&quot; the final setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use refl@@ ex@@ ation . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light @-@ reflection . it takes very long to charge a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this cardboard card you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is then transparent , if the corresponding beams have no object made . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ consoles edition . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; unexpected , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ Sc@@ ene , select the menu entry file and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; yet not the complete command of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . if , when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , shows a dialog window a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import it , write this source text between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from object nut into the editor to export the source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; to import objects into the scene , just select the source text in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
&quot; with copying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , and in your editor you can insert HTML @-@ Source for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; likewise . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on the help in the original view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the indicated object shown here . put the path to your documentation and the version . supported the version 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example elevation of elevation ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file contained in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire @-@ models . the second color is used for the display of the selected objects .
the colour for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the lens in the camera view and in the window type labels .
&quot; you can set the object start of points on the wheel model in the context menu of the wire menu of the wire menu . you can adjust here the grid separately for shifting , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model , and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can adjust the level of detail for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you select High Detailed arrangements for extended proj@@ ections , all wire @-@ model views are structured , all proj@@ ections are using an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions the perspective and the sen@@ k@@ right proj@@ ections . this property results in better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; when you show walls cl@@ uster , a wall behind the objects is cleared . the wall is shown in a ch@@ ecker @-@ board pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you show the soil , a ground is divided below the objects . the ground is displayed in a ch@@ ecker @-@ board pattern from two in@@ stell@@ able colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate the cant@@ onal , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted to you in section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can create an existing window t@@ app@@ ings , or create new window frames . in the window sheet @-@ regulations , you can create and store window frames . &quot;
the combination field standard @-@ window order : displays all existing window frames . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window lists shows all existing window lists . a new order can create and delete a selected arrangement with the button dischar@@ ges .
every window order will be identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the chosen window order . new views can create you with the button Add to add and delete selected views with the button dischar@@ ges .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , you can create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ paid view the window under the existing window , with cardboard card and we@@ aving the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; installed and now you would like to start with no more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you are following all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate scene , while beginn@@ er very popular : a bul@@ let at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings carefully before you complain that you can use as a result only one black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules for ren@@ dering can be applied as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not fit light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have everything fl@@ aw@@ less installed , take a look at the first start from &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; the following pre @-@ set window order : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so that you can expect an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their applications . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; start with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . just select the scene and then choose the menu item . so that you have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate . in particular you notice the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; object _ object contains now a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the View Properties in which the different parameters can be found in the camera . find out more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later adequ@@ acy , but note that the camera in view control points , with which you can change the way@@ point of the camera , click on a controlling point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you apply the kno@@ b or press the inputs , change the wire @-@ model views and the object @-@ tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could fit for example a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a di@@ visible method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simple possibility . you can use an infinite layer as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button . in the object tree the new name is instantly displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire model now also shows the level , although at the moment only as a limited plane . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the level extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you watch out the object nut exactly , you will notice that you can click the entry for the bottom . in this case you will see the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object Properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the horizont@@ ally , just allow you to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift , and adjust the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are lots of different materials , but select a bit at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog will be inserted in which you can choose how the object is inserted . please select the name in the property command ( name = ground @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ment shows only a Matt@@ es black material because you can still enter settings for pig@@ ment . do not think that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities but now take the easiest way . &quot;
&quot; if you do not preview the color on qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the soil is right now . if you click on the icon now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following results : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . you have expected to enter two new attributes , called mon@@ ar@@ big . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more common , but the ch@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; select in the object tree jed@@ es@@ mal , and change the colors in the View of the properties tab : &quot;
&quot; this step should you already run simply because you should have understood the basic methods of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; already , the ball lets itself just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the property Properties you can instantly change the settings . set the value for radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input table or the button ) , so that the sphere would vary above the ground , as you have shifted the ground for one unit down below . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering now results in a stran@@ ger result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a Matt@@ es black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material . like already in the floor , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as colour : &quot;
&quot; select First Sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click &quot; &quot; Pig@@ ment , select &quot; &quot; one , then select the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; however , you can reach interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot;
&quot; then change the values like in the following screen , and click to apply or press the input . &quot;
&quot; the attitudes of gloss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or ver@@ rom@@ ed finishes , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what opportunities to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ ay@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , the ren@@ derer &apos;s hyp@@ othe@@ tical bl@@ asting from the perspective of the viewer ( d. h. from the camera , the scenes are calculated and broken , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as atmospheric effects such as fo@@ g . thus , the scene pixels for pixels edited . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . without a light source , you see nothing , the image is just black . obviously every scene needs to be framed , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file you have previously made with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
the scene in the last stored version will be recovered . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
&quot; this menu , you can only select , if you have not stored any changes stored in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeatedly , the last und@@ o &apos;s command . this menu item you can only select if you have used editing back@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; saves the current window order and opens a dialog , in which you can enter a name for a new order or write an existing order . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers , here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can edit or add new orders with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers .
opens a dialogue to set up the tool@@ boxes . you can add and remove information with this option tool@@ bar for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to handle rough surfaces without any b@@ ump on the surface individually , and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file both for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic body are simple geomet@@ rical shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from doz@@ ens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of a object color on pixels base , using a picture file as a color card . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable sculp@@ tor and browser . the application has a file browser , where you can choose images to display . &quot;
images can be displayed either in a separate window at the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; at@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you may display with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button Return .
you can adjust if any picture should be displayed in a separate window or whether all images are always used to use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a password file was highlighted , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue setting - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , general and editing and slides@@ how , you can set the operation of &amp; at@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short @-@ command for the Net , the short@@ cuts for the respective window can be specified . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad area is filled with the background color that you can adjust further down . default is not a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is enabled , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slides@@ how . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; with the name of the last opened folder . next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the coloured beams to select a background color . this is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , it is also filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can &amp; p @-@ show ; to set up , that only some of the file types will be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
with this option for big images the indicator window is enlarged on the full screen . this option is switched as default .
determine whether the slides@@ how to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the period between the metabolism is to change in a slides@@ how . to change the value , you can type a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;

&quot; as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project , this means that the user contributes to its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; the show@@ photo shows you as easy as possible faul@@ ts or possible improvements . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser displays a page for reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to finish your message . &quot;
&quot; the show@@ photo is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you want to answer any other users from &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you can answer questions to other users from &amp; show@@ photo . in this mailing list , however , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developers mailing list from &amp; show@@ photo . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you as much control over his work processes as possible . you can select the show@@ room &apos;s behaviour in eight pages . you can change between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; in the field of gas@@ k@@ ets , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ tones indi@@ k@@ ator should display the colors with what you are supposed to be in contrast . lower colour should display a bright colour and over@@ tones a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected pictures . the same page bar can also be found in the image processing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five riders :

&quot; &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for sc@@ ans of images , which can no longer open as images to scan and save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the pictures prior to saving . &quot;
you can check the status of support of your scanner at the SAN@@ E project page by regi@@ stering the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ project@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner was not opened or if no default scanner is indicated , then a dialog to choose the scanner . &quot;
the user can select the scanner and push OK to open the scanner . ab@@ ort &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not especially .
&quot; to add a picture , the user can start a pres@@ et can start and then get a scanning for the final scan . the Vor@@ sch@@ aus@@ can be started by the preview @-@ button . &quot;
to select the picture better the user can choose into the picture and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . he can also set the z@@ oom so that the complete list fits into the window .
when the picture was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when S@@ aving a preview is selected in the settings , then the image is displayed in a subur@@ b , as shown below is displayed , then when saving pushed down , then the image is stored and sl@@ ey ? en leads to a break@@ down and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog is opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the picture , if desired , in front of the stor@@ ing . in this case the option is to be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option must be chosen . &quot;
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can select . dialogue to save for each picture opens the dialogue in front of any picture image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this is automatically stor@@ ing with a generated name in a previously defined folder ; then you must save it without a fil@@ en@@ ame .
&quot; this setting defines where the pictures can be saved on the option without saving up after a fil@@ en@@ ame , then this folder is used as standard for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture fix for the automatically saving images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . this automatically generated picture gets a numer@@ ical view@@ ix of the jed@@ es@@ mal , the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can custom@@ ize the image quality . this value is also changing the com@@ pression value while saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the standard value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button help starts KDE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the KDE About -@@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and shots can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of this p@@ etting and their function . the global short@@ cuts you can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window and select a short @-@ command button .
&quot; you may set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; -@@ short @-@ command , make your keyboard up to &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; control center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which mostly also can be found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , players , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P @-@ function &quot;
&quot; AMAR@@ OK supports the command lines of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition , Amar@@ ok has still some own command lines . &quot;
&quot; you should give a feedback to the user when the script should not be executed because of a lack of dependence . please check in your script , whether all required modules are available and make use of dialog , so that the user is not running . &quot;

&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / Reg@@ .@@ you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or simply extend it to the required features . you will quickly find that writing script is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; using D@@ CO@@ P can control your scripts with amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be attached to every KDE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the output from external programmes and commands . this way the function can be called ex@@ ec ( ) . this way can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy . here an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; send messages to all running scripts . for this reason , script should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script should ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure displays the script to display the dialog dialog . to save and loading of the furnishings you need to take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ load on the folder , where all data should be saved . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ alized that a new piece is used . the script could now ask for example ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the st@@ ables ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alized a change of volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger range between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ ize : sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le , ab@@ st@@ alled the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu item can be printed . to remove an entry again you d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; termin@@ ates , or if the user stops a script , sends and AMAR@@ OK ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed so as the saving of data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ oks script administration can also install script packages , which can also be com@@ pressed , with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which can also be used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Ex@@ t@@ ying amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script package immediately right . &quot;
&quot; the main cri@@ pts must be exec@@ utable , ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; when your script is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and the link to the Wi@@ ki script side of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; attach the category AMAR@@ OK ; script . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; AMAR@@ OK , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus instead of using endless menus . with &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; &apos; s collection browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you have some play@@ lists , you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is exactly right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart playlist automatically choose the right music for certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; AMAR@@ OK has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many other generic USB devices . also many other useful features make Amar@@ ok to the most advanced audio player . AMAR@@ OK is intelligent , sexy and fancy - just the right to re@@ discover your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one has to enter the bas@@ folders of Amar@@ ok sources to compile Amar@@ ok and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; auto@@ conf@@ use and autom@@ ake , you should do not have difficulties when comp@@ iling any difficulties . if you encounter any problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing list . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; has like most applications some options that can enable or dis@@ able to compens@@ ate with the configure script or dis@@ able it . this is a list of options available .
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in developing &amp; AMAR@@ OK , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; can be set up without trouble through the interior dialog . the dialog dialog has several card cards to set up the various features of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ;
&quot; player windows show the player window in addition to the playlist , one or off . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists will be sho@@ wn@@ ( Ju@@ K ) . &quot;
&quot; mood bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available , if &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . the option hing@@ es the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; atmospheric design : this function is only available , if &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this means that the dy@@ e for the mood bar@@ ometer changed . &quot;
&quot; mood files set in the music files : this function is only available , if &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ mood files stored in the settings folder of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; AMAR@@ OK , will be started when a browser is needed . &quot;
use other browsers : you can specify the path to another browser which is not included in the list .
&quot; playlist when saving , save the current playlist automatically saves the loading of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; . activate this option if you would not want to lose the current playlist . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , B &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files are stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces in the piece @-@ change , causes the play@@ lists window to hold off , to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing to the context @-@ browser displays automatically the context @-@ browser automatically , as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the section appearance , you can custom@@ ize &amp; AMAR@@ OK . the section is in three parts under@@ part . &quot;
&quot; in the fonts section , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; AMAR@@ OK . you can select fonts for the following section : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browser . press to select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of customised color scheme , you yourself have the Qu@@ al of the choice and can specify a custom colour scheme . do not use the fin@@ er color selection for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; to start playing on the start , that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; after the program start playing the play automatically with the piece at the place where it was stopped at the last finish . &quot;
the sub@@ window On @-@ screen display allows you to display the switching of the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is app@@ ended , a preview of the O@@ SD and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the cross @-@ field shadow causes that the text in the O@@ SD sh@@ aded .
&quot; using own colors will give you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog to color selection . if owner &apos;s colours do not have been activated , the pre@@ fabri@@ cated &amp; k@@ gs are used ; colours used . &quot;
&quot; the input field display text presents the text shown in the O@@ SD text . through the type of space , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available space @-@ card and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the option screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama user . this allows you to set up , on which screen a multi @-@ line monitor environment the O@@ SD is supposed to appear . &quot;
the card @-@ card audio @-@ output makes you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers activate even further settings in this box card .
the card collection is used for setting all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; search for music files . to select a folder in the collection , next to its name . this section also contains an@@ cross fields to place , as with the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ folder browse , this means that &amp; AMAR@@ OK , as well as their sub@@ folder as well as their sub@@ folder as well . &quot;
&quot; changes to monitor : allows &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . moreover , an incre@@ mental search is done to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists import , causes that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection adds . the automatically added playlist will appear later in the play@@ lists browser . &quot;
&quot; the part of collecting @-@ database is used for the collection of a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . when My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another facility is needed in the Sub@@ si@@ ql establishment . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql establishment is used for setting up the database for &amp; AMAR@@ OK . under calcul@@ ator , the computer is entered , under which the database is att@@ ain@@ able , under which the database is att@@ ain@@ able . name : is the database name that is made . &quot;
use User@@ name : and password : to access the data required for connection to the database .
the cart@@ on card load .@@ f@@ m does the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; can provide the names of played st@@ ains to a pay@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the actual piece .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your load .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; re@@ played pieces , send so the profile update : this setting allows it &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; to transmit the names of the played pieces on your duty .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
&quot; similar artists call : after activation , this setting is called &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; a list of similar artists to the each playing piece . note : you can &apos;t use the list in the context @-@ browser to be able to use this function . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery with screens@@ hot .
&quot; AMAR@@ OK needed only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further KDE packages . you need to find K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the included programs , for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small manual on how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will support the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome is thus functioning , but flu@@ x@@ box will support e.g. difficulties . we try to support AMAR@@ OK on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these are prepared an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make a bug in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can see the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . afterwards you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly it is that Tag@@ lib rus@@ hed to read the met@@ a @-@ Info from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try to try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is something more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; the libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; AMAR@@ OK , with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then this leads to overthrow in the mach@@ ining of the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then turn off machine . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ bone via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) , and send us a good che@@ at , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs can write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 to the met@@ a @-@ Info , but do not draw up as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / perl that does not exist : M@@ p@@ lib &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; s symbols in the stat@@ us@@ bar ( acci@@ dentally / re@@ petition / Dynam@@ ics playlist ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can see the status de@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this attitude shows its effect .
if you get this mistake : amar@@ oc@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ oc@@ app : un@@ plug @-@ on Pix@@ o : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if AMAR@@ OK the correct Q@@ t library . this can be found using ld@@ d &apos;@@ sch@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may possibly remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ ing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that AMAR@@ OK it finds the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems arise at the light@@ est by the help of a experts your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . you can also look for help with other users or at the developers . use it for the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # AMAR@@ OK .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to seek help . please enter there only one error if something is located on the removal of a bug in AMAR@@ OK itself .
after the start of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; will only be a blank playlist . how do I get music pieces there ?
that &apos;s easy . use the file navig@@ ator on the left and open the folder folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive to keep the start -@@ under@@ window into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under Extr@@ as statistics .
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points will be automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , it must be displayed in the playlist of the playlist . click anywhere in the playlist of the playlist , and select column for a piece . you can also use the short @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and select from the playlist remove from the pop@@ up menu . &quot;
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall exactly as you would do with other files . so simple is that : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , just beside the add @-@ button , you can save the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
probably you lack the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; new . look even after lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is available in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides , you will find it via the menu bar under Extr@@ as E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; none . yes , that is true ! no ! &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question must be supported mon@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support text and P@@ NG to de@@ code ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! perhaps use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with what in default no MP3 de@@ coder are provided ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ SA @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a mix@@ er . a bl@@ ender allows several applications to use the device at the same time , or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA . &quot;
the issue of this command should help you search for the problem of your problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to indicate another proposition ( e.g. os@@ s@@ C ) .
&quot; sorry &amp; AMAR@@ OK , already . do not forget that media must first de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is for most people the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a decade or little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate the Sound@@ server with highest priority ( warning ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( warning : see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per su@@ id is set :
&quot; at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause disturbed reproduction . read this error message . the magni@@ fying the sound buff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA tool file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts @-@ Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts Pu@@ ffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller of the bu@@ ffer , the less revenue react to visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , that is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes or AMAR@@ OK . why ? &quot;
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all the components . perform G@@ ST regi@@ sters to register all the stre@@ amer components .
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask at IR@@ C @-@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( finish AMAR@@ OK before ! ) : - store ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . perform the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; AMAR@@ OK . &quot;

&quot; &amp; cd@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ iso@@ fs ; : burning all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; cd@@ record ; has all functions , which also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; usually automatically ects &amp; cd@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases it achiev@@ es &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CD . &quot;
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet such programs are generally called ri@@ pper .
og@@ g Pre@@ up to library : og@@ g Vor@@ till is an entirely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio data flow . og@@ g pre @-@ up benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ till Dek@@ o@@ der@@ - and En@@ coder modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio de@@ coder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 de@@ coder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a developed MP3 de@@ coder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ En@@ coder module .
FL@@ AC : a free open source co@@ dec for des@@ per@@ ing audio com@@ pression and -@@ de@@ com@@ pression . it is used by the FL@@ AC Dec@@ oder module and the external audio @-@ En@@ coder module so you can read and write FL@@ AC files .
&quot; Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FL@@ AC , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : further libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example possible to de@@ cryp@@ t it on an audio CD to comb@@ at@@ ed.@@ de@@ co &quot;
&quot; SO@@ x : an aid program , which can come from different audio formats - and can convert . SO@@ x is used by the SO@@ x Audio En@@ coder module . &quot;
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : one in the function of fully equipped car system for processing , Dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ sing video @-@ CDs and Super @-@ Video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can be useful for example , for creating char@@ x@@ ten CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different notes can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces differ according to it . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and can automatically re@@ play all videos at the base folder of the CD .
&quot; this is a comfortable method , recently opened projects again . the related sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been stored once , the previously used file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new file name . &quot;
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . KDE &apos;s dialogue save under is displayed with which you can choose the folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all open projects . this is the same as if you want to Save Files for each individual project
&quot; includes the current project . if a project is changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what has to happen . you can then also check out between stor@@ ing and modifications . besides , you can also ab@@ ort and hold the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each not stored project , which shall happen to happen , just as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
includes all open projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project will be asked what happened to happen as if you were called a file .
&quot; if you call this entry , you can select over the adver@@ t dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you select the files directly from the top view into the project @-@ view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added to the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialogue &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the additional kno@@ b burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only be opened if the project is already included . &quot;
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings to most of which are the ? -@@ Help described ( att@@ ain@@ able via the right mouse button ) .
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you do not use files for multiple session , even if this function is not used , even if this function is not used , so that you can already see the files and folder on the medium . &quot;
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function promp@@ ted &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to remove files from the current project . this function does not remove files from the medium , it only ends the previously imported files back . &quot;
&quot; the CD @-@ copying dialog will open the copying of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a CD on a different medium . alternatively , there is also the possibility of K@@ lon@@ ens instead of normal phot@@ oc@@ opy . you should also prefer you , if you wish to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; to open the DVD copy of DVD to another medium . alternatively , there is also the possibility of converting a DVD to another medium . alternatively , there is also the possibility of converting a DVD with the help of cop@@ ing dialogue is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
&quot; opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you select the choice between the sp@@ mod@@ i over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns a previously experienced CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which is then immediately not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , for this you must use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns a previously experienced DVD @-@ image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning bon@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; an earlier DVD @-@ video can be converted . this dialog window will usually help you to read a DVD in the content view , but it can also be used everywhere , it contains information about the out@@ sour@@ ced video , codi@@ fication settings and even ways to change the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the occasion@@ al medium . this information is displayed in the contents and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of the tool@@ boxes of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small p@@ ending at the bottom of the window appears . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view is part of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives will also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and un@@ locking of the drive or throwing the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view is one or out . the ingredients allows you to choose and drag files into the project &apos;s view . the content view is also the interface to reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the Kop@@ industri@@ ous is a narrow area , which is only visible when the working view is an narro@@ wer range , which contains only visible when the working view has an open feature , it just looks pretty , and separates the project &apos;s view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window for changing the ke@@ yp@@ asses for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the key@@ note order below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; furnishings assist@@ ants . this enables you to enter the correct permission for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system managers are needed , so you must enter the password for the system manager ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b will open the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can work general terms and functions . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , should work on an@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alize and for the en@@ dow@@ ment of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many others &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface equipped with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions to use , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so that your taste and nature of your tasks are crucial to what the sample you can give you . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you must make sure you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program ma@@ stered , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts that are described below . &quot;
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions to support new projects . &quot;

&quot; &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ instructor for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , you can easily read audio @-@ CD ; s are read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder of the computer . &quot;
&amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; -@@ data in W@@ AV files on the hard drive ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ ers who are currently supported ( com@@ pression ) by default ( these Ko@@ di@@ ver packages must be added before the Linux distribution ) . further Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD will be read and stored in W@@ AV files on your computer ( free and com@@ pressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) com@@ pressed to the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format , or in other formats like the &quot; &quot; free FL@@ AC &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD , is used by &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step must be installed ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre@@ until ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ erer . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , but if for example FL@@ AC is not used , the installation is not required . &quot;
which body @-@ file / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and com@@ pression factors . &quot;
a word to copying from protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audio creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any protected audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid any protected audio CD ; do not simply avoid the mechanism of cop@@ ier audio @-@ CD . simply avoid the purchase of cop@@ ier audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the entry needs to be done only once ( the furniture dialog , however , can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD ( hopefully ) explains the hard drive . this leads to an understanding of the sl@@ ender approach to the user interface , which you will frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on what type of codes can be installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can get a CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is only a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example , further information such as this program is used as well as screen@@ caps with descriptions of tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
starting the CD@@ DB request of CD @-@ data according to the registration of request within the registration card CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online in the latter case first the connection must be made to the Internet . )
start reading and - if an En@@ coder is configured in the en@@ coder settings in the interior browser - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available En@@ coder , so that the choice can be read with another En@@ coder as the default . it is to note that previously the en@@ coder was configured in the en@@ coder settings in the interior dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already packed file is selected for code , rather than a full &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the tool dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programs ( like reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ audio creator ; with various boxes cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the en@@ co@@ ders ) . here , you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes audio quality , co@@ di@@ ers and com@@ pression and helps you to choose the right body . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a des@@ i@@ free audio format is required . besides FL@@ AC there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may possibly be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are the low com@@ pression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , which lose information through data com@@ pression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower Bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both Ko@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is free with most distri@@ butions available for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
+ High to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but compared to O@@ GG easily deeper quality in deeper bit@@ rates .
&quot; og@@ g - if only music is to be heard from one machine or a computer @-@ based music system , and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG connector devices are available . &quot;
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stere@@ o@@ systems . today - early 2009 - support these devices often only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting com@@ pression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , com@@ pression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , com@@ pression rate approximately 5.5 . needs more and 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older machines need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , com@@ pression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable equipment and auto@@ stere@@ o@@ ids . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &quot; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that are manually taken manually or by the program automatically fet@@ ched from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / or use the folder and file name as well as the features of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co@@ di@@ ver programs , there is often a combination of program@@ ing material for the co@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs . &quot;
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : tag ) add when MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame must be added to the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; cut@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &quot; ... &quot; tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; cut@@ out creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in assist@@ ants ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which you can download the audio CD , so that all the other information can be downloaded instead of text : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the U@@ eber@@ ry : this is the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information or less valuable , so can neither the artist nor the music business damage . all information can be obtained in any bum@@ ble@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively used to select a cross box ( sending a address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems to be used the email address when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries , there are copies of the main database . if &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use the free@@ DB is set up , the geograph@@ ically to be used on the nearest mirror server . this saves band@@ width in the network and resem@@ bles the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a list of mir@@ rors for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually posted monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading programme is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are ru@@ m@@ ors to use cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to know more accurately , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; it was always aware that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package needs to be installed first , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; for stor@@ ing the out@@ sour@@ ced W@@ AV files , the body can be chosen for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FL@@ AC ( a faul@@ t@@ less com@@ pression for audio data ) on the tab for the entry of the body . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution , before the co@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined en@@ erer . for more information on Ko@@ di@@ erer can be found in the chapter Which Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a body , further information about its switches can be obtained through the input of a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a consoles window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . there must be &apos; l@@ ame &apos; by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the setup of the device for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could be an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envel@@ ope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this tips can give you how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , everything is understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do is ? well , no problem , follow this step by step , and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example we will start the program for the first time , all set up and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to produce MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . at least , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have scre@@ ened them ( eg ; by trying to copy the con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
the first section covers the basic classification of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which can only be done once and
&quot; the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD , what needs to be repeated for any out &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; here we determine the com@@ pression Ko@@ di@@ erer for com@@ pression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resul@@ t@@ ant sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are lazy , we split the program to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with any release of a &amp; CD ; change even if the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device @-@ drawing is given to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device recording of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , so can a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the card card general settings . here gi@@ b@@ ts do not have much to do . here an additional conversion will be defined . in our example everything will be so animated / entered as shown in the screens@@ hot .
&quot; only in case of incomplete information please select , so that you will be notified if data is missing from key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
the card card CD ; -@@ settings . easily select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the machine must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet to allow it to access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry is immediately associated with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame name / fil@@ en@@ ame or day entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame will be modified and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , it is further to note : if you want to use everything manually , so clear the selection of the box and free@@ DB is not used . however , this over 620 MB large , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to free@@ ze in the offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set on the following map card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server over the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD is to get ? read the section about the free@@ DB . put it all as shown in the screens@@ hot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way the load is distributed between the computers . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function simultaneous on what the server concerns , as many fire@@ walls bear the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should be de@@ activated .
simply take the settings from the screens@@ hot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; at the same time out@@ breaks pieces : ap@@ ology , there is one reason why more than one at the same time only an existing drive ? Parall@@ el@@ es Read and Co@@ ding ? the author knows it not so easy to try . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to throw the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are stored this anchor , then the W@@ AV files can be stored , if only room on another drive is present . this folder doesn &apos;t have to be stored in the private folder , if you don &apos;t want to make this folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; everything to enter as shown on the screens@@ hot . the command is somewhat long , under certain circumstances a little to right is placed to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio @-@ quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the achieved com@@ pression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of generating tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; day for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest like in the screens@@ hot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; the number of simultaneous W@@ AV files : at a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried , to bo@@ de more than one W@@ AV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , described as the process of reading of the &amp; CD ; to the hard drive . we will set up a connection to the Internet , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB is described , has to be repeated for each issu@@ ing &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in free@@ DB , see the screens@@ hot a little different from the ones for a &amp; CD ; with successful from free@@ DB de@@ for@@ ested data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually put to pick them out of the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet to happen , now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the window , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and length are listed in the window , as in the screens@@ hot . this only if the &amp; CD is identified ; as an audio CD , could be identified and can be read from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this does not happen then you &apos;re looking for questions and answers to help or go back to the previous section on fundamental settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was picked up from the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window is built @-@ in , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best suited to your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the an@@ kreu@@ z for the automatic query from free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input the CD @-@ Data and the Tit@@ le of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; . &quot;
the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the free@@ DB the CD @-@ Editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to start the contents of the CD Edit@@ ors ( e.g. if all words start with major letters , or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields to the artist , album , and title of a piece , and on only 28 signs for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have an unlimited field length , at least for what &amp; col@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum gives you a look into the section &apos; basic settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the aid to the body @-@ makers in order to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry , which obviously corresponds to the style of the tel@@ es@@ ending CD ; but in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or r@@ ap for example are to be found under rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD editor will be back and you see that the boxes for the album already filled with the given data we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the actual piece of the piece . the piece of the piece is definitely the case and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB database . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the piece list .
&quot; note that there has been a check @-@ sign prior to each line of a piece . just the titles that are marked by one piece or out . make sure that all pieces are selected , or enter the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces on once . &quot;
&quot; was started by clicking on the button to read the read@@ ings process , then this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
click on the rider orders for switching on the order window . he is in the left upper half of the window below the buttons on the tool@@ bar .
&quot; this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is read straight onto the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window , in the status bar . &quot;
&quot; this error message , if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ erer that you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully coded , are marked with a red &apos;@@ X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target @-@ folders are not what we have entered in example . have you checked whether you write write access to the folder for temporary files and audi@@ ences ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred right after the end of the read of the first piece of the piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece of it , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , reading and en@@ coding parallel . note the stat@@ ute in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found configuration settings to under@@ go this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes for reading and co@@ ding . with the weak machines the result is unclear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem during simultaneous reading and code ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order in the queue of the body is coded . after the last piece is coded , a small window is built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . / 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate com@@ pressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the Ko@@ di@@ ver of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; cut@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is now enter@@ t@@ ained within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the normal media package , however , you can download an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audio creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de package . if you &apos;re reading this , you have probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to individuals , compiled by source files , and not for users intended to use the pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is true for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . on the best you can read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the various box cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still reading this day ? even if only the help menu after the first time the program has been cli@@ cked , without any cl@@ ue as it is going on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive is ) , or from un@@ usually short menu out ? &quot;
what does it go ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should somehow look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio creator ; for who also always do something useful or change it , May it does . at least until the contact with the author . and if you read this , he indicated this section and therefore do not agree with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange if you have been able to pick the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he has had real @-@ time graf@@ ic and car@@ a@@ oke @-@ genuin@@ eness of texts also some features that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI @-@ players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; supports also the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with altern@@ ating color , making it simple to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI @-@ channel by her@@ nia of the penet@@ rated buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; every MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to the K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) . K@@ Mid automatically displays the techniques used .
&quot; sitting support . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; end of a song , K@@ Mid start once again with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialogue with which you can choose the chosen song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will also work with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and enter the button bar to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry item out of the menu piece or enter the emp@@ t@@ ass@@ el . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then play@@ back . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ ad and thus change the play@@ back speed . to get back the original pace , click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the Le@@ ath@@ ar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the but@@ ton@@ ed as a pressure on the kno@@ b break or the ex@@ changing the menu entry break in the menu piece , then breaks the play@@ back during no piece , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play@@ back . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be saved on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use text planning , others use song tex@@ tual , and again other both . some pieces do not have any text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set up what events are to be presented and even better : the event type is automatically chosen , so that you have to set anything manually . if you choose the menu item the item Autom@@ atic text selection , but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a event type , select from the menu settings the entries or song submitted directories . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you merge . these will be played in line . in this section you can use collections efficiently .
&quot; to get a collection , open first to the collection . this you will find in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ise .... click here in New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then select the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the lo@@ oting in a collection . &quot;
&quot; to the temporary collection , all the songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when using the application , this collection is not saved . concerns you when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collecting duct . there you can add a song with the button Add to add a song , with whose help you can choose the chosen song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic exec@@ uting to the collection is activated , a piece by opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when Autom@@ atic add to the collection is not activated , the opening of a piece is activated the temporary collection and approved . this collection will then be added to the open pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection , the collection and the desired song and then click on del@@ e@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are installed . if you select the sequence according to the sub@@ menu click of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add or remove songs or select the sequence in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in collecting device , or use the selection list of the Kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump to a song , select the button &quot; &quot; Next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song back , select the button previous piece , the entry forecast item from the menu piece or push the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection camp , select the extingu@@ ishing collection there and click on the button delete . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter since it is not saved in the case of &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for Syn@@ thesizer , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ map general @-@ MIDI events occur in events that understands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map which trans@@ forms all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and therefore always makes a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound@@ card , you do not need MIDI @-@ map , because all Sound@@ cards GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , which stores all necessary re@@ ali@@ zations for the play of a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section should only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section which may appear as often as desired . for this purpose , however , that every occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you can see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a paragraph is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your Map @-@ File as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support may provide devices that are not general MIDI @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section the patches provided by General MIDI on your specific keyboard . the general usage looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ als will be ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order for one of 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds , which this instrument is to put on the tone with the number M ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to gun powder . this allows you to enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; if so now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( Win ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is meant with the word drum patch of the patch , in which each tone represents another perc@@ ussion@@ instrument ( Drum , Bas@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one who means the sound @-@ height of the always same drum ( as they own some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how t@@ ints are shown on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section the order of the lines is very important , as well as their availability . so you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can use multiple Key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you just need to use different names in the first row .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to form sounds on the Per@@ k@@ eling channel . look at the supplied key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to cut some channels to others . if you want to switch to the first and second channel , you can easily do it in the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the perc@@ ussion on a specific channel ( general MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section which has 16 lines , numbered between 0 and 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; N is thereby the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map is necessary to use the name name for this channel . if you want to change the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case there is always Patch x . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the Per@@ k@@ icks patch on the Per@@ k@@ ur channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Rati@@ o indicates that the ratio of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ Event sends out with the value , this is calculated with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file ( no dec@@ im@@ al@@ kom@@ mas are ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used because GM pres@@ upp@@ oses to play a keyboard , which is a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event , with the value 40@@ 96 to play a note higher . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards higher up to a oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , just open the dialogue MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole range of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard you see which sounds are just played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . if you have changed a tool , the button no longer green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view ( until now ) two different views to display the played notes . view in the Settings menu under the point Can@@ al@@ view : settings
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you find e.g. finding a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; . with this , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just like two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file will need a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have been compiled , because &amp; k@@ mid ; no A@@ we support have to compile and install the problem ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s Home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
previously un@@ activ@@ ating the setting of automation Add to the collection . otherwise the files will be added to temporary collection .
you can click the arrow key left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the play@@ back . to restore the default temp@@ o you can click on the LCD double .
I &apos;ve been on a &amp; k@@ point ; -@@ work space a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop I have to play when the collection is played or I want to play a file only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them equal to a collection , turn the setting of automatic Add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; suppose you take the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . firstly , you only want to play the first file . so , create the setting of Automati@@ cal Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . their temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then close yourself to record B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all warm thanks ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , animated me that , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;

&quot; my thanks also goes to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the testing of the A@@ we support , H@@ as P@@ etter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Mr. Di@@ ef@@ enb@@ ru@@ ch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us Pfe@@ ffer , Ulrich Cor@@ der and anyone who sent me a patch , a trou@@ bles@@ ome or also only a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the web that give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ mid , can also be found on his homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . on the homepage you can watch the development , information look and images . you will also find links to sites with further car@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use a FM @-@ device or an A@@ we card .
&quot; if you have no sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it runs as if you have a sound@@ card , except that you can of course no music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is needed to play video files of the player or PH@@ ON@@ ON supported formats , as well as for viewing DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ &apos;s name ; has not yet been finished as a &amp; k@@ de ; on this machine was installed .
for additional help please check the site The KDE website on new versions or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
&quot; the application window is made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . however , there is always the window with the central view . op@@ tionally , there is windows with the playlist . and finally , there is a information window that will only appear to be displayed in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to push the favorite connections under the menu read@@ ings , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are used to each other , so you should use the category Dau@@ d playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you post an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category will be copied and the play@@ back starts with the cli@@ pping entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and perman@@ ency playlist can also be changed by direct em@@ ing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps , but also by the application itself . by using a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing the XML files , must be selected from the menu item with playlist , and either selected by mach@@ ining mode , or another category . &quot;
all modifications shall be lost if the mach@@ ining mode leave or another group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player , some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
the animation during the starting and loading can be disabled by pressing a ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and Chang@@ ing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can simply be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; km@@ player ; will be the files ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / apps / apps / apps / km@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during the starting needs not be short , it will automatically end through the opening of another source . this would be bother@@ ing at the end @-@ in , however , the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favourite photos : &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; km@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; km@@ player ;
&quot; there is a rider for configuration of M@@ players in the configur@@ ations dialog by &amp; km@@ player . here , the path from the M@@ Player and the terminal size of the data stream from the network and other things can be adjusted . &quot;
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of km@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no rider for this playlist in the configur@@ ations dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manually editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . here &apos;s an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; km@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to reproduce the &amp; km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , must be the &amp; km@@ player ; module as service provider for the m@@ ime type , / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the interior dialog file command from KDE . &quot;
&quot; the kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; km@@ player ; is available in a consoles application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if there is no mistakes , the Back@@ end edition is inside &amp; km@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , a checked back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type is ( of course only if this has been established ) , this must be done by manual changes from the file ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , PH@@ ON@@ ON should be re@@ printed all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner can be used to be used in the configur@@ ing dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to use the V@@ DR ( video data records ) settings in km@@ player is the dialogue in the settings below - &gt; Source &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port to use . there should be detected ports , for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
since the V@@ DR support from km@@ player only X@@ video can be used ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also used only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
&quot; internally are used by KM@@ Player for sources different names . at the time of the emergence of these documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , source source , t@@ v@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , source source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play@@ list of the playlist . &quot;
are there references as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive . if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to be done as user root according to the inclusion of the device . thereby , it is absolutely secure to make that / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive shows . &quot;
X@@ ine starts only slowly but why has my CPU to be tested for its performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ e. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time it will check the CPU . &quot;

lat@@ ex ; : a professional fonts . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be accessed on the package &amp; textile live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation should be attracted to the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD can be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are available on the k@@ ile .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions regarding the documentation is taken into account . if the support for this project or documentation is desired , the contact with the k@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or if comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile ; on or are enh@@ ancements desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list of k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net . &quot;

&quot; the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile , is a native function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of assist@@ ants for the creation of the document . it can also be made some of the document related to the document . &quot;
&quot; categories : this is hereby given the type of document document , writing &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
en@@ coding : this indicates the text en@@ coding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using the U@@ TF @-@ 8 -@@ coding as default . best if U@@ TF @-@ 8x should be used ( for the correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list usually contains the added value packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; . for the inclusion it is only balanced in the cross @-@ field area .

new users are not worried . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information on this page are given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other sources of source editors - the nar@@ ration of used prec@@ epts , attitudes and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . through &amp; k@@ ile , it is often noticed that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is saving you by the modest appearance of the output volume . however , it is saving you through the twi@@ light time and weight . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic understanding of the environments , by entering a new command ( such as \ \ &apos; { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for example \ \ end { Command } ) . this function can be disabled in the settings . &quot;
&quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; sometimes the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common , and sub@@ du@@ sting element ) : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed through a mouse @-@ click on the respective and be viewed . &quot;
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; -@@ file &#91; framed ) &#93; . once a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
&quot; a DVI ; file contained a description of the form@@ ated document and also other information such as the font , and is next to PDF the above output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are lots of tools to view , conversion and print of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and services . &quot;
when using the rank@@ ings the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file with the editor was shorten@@ ed and as soon as an item is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; -@@ source code is the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text is cli@@ cked in the appropriate place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer .
&quot; Master @-@ Document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other integrated .@@ tex -@@ files is simplified . when using a project , a project project can be set to project settings . &quot;
quick @-@ installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no errors are displayed in the source text ) .
&quot; file alert : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file , there is no call of &amp; Oc@@ epi@@ ece ; and it is not a call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the fast @-@ construction . &quot;
&quot; in viewing the mach@@ ining tool@@ bar , the three large sections of the selection should be described in the document . the first selection range is for the rapid integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The Dec@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the drop section is for the purpose of articles such as tags , joints , notes or references . &quot;
&quot; designation : with this command a term for a section , one image or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection range ) .
&quot; in case of quot@@ ation , a selection list with liter@@ ary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file is necessary for a project . for the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; from hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ dd will be used for determining the font , for the main text , the joints , notes etc . it is the following scrip@@ tures to provide : &quot;
&quot; in the call of &amp; k@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document art and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch with the hand . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; will determine the font , and not at the beginning , this may also happen in the text . &quot;
once the above source example was entered into the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text must be compiled . the easiest way to do is using the menu or the button @-@ up quick .
the source code must be saved in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for stor@@ ing the storage automatically .
&quot; this comp@@ iling the comp@@ iling of the document , should be sear@@ ched in the logging for errors . when using fre@@ bau should be started &amp; Oc@@ epi@@ ece ; this is not the case , the logging should also be respected . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English . environment ) is a text , which is different from the remaining document . for example , a report with the let@@ tering document is created and only a few sentences should have a different scrip@@ tures and \ \ end { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } . &quot;
the benefits are only placed in the area ( from \ \ &apos; { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limitation ( number ) for countries within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to improve the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , there are certain fonts , fat printing , cur@@ sions , etc . these commands can either be added with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course of course and is long as long as it is closed until he can be filled with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be checked with \ \ &apos; { word } .
\ \ Per@@ cent@@ age : created a quot@@ ation in the document . the quot@@ ation starts with \ \ &apos; A ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mark@@ er , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; once in the assistant a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . this should be a quot@@ ation , a few places in the fat and cur@@ si@@ veness and a poem to use in order to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document was viewed , can be sent using an editor or C@@ tr@@ l e to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , its window must be closed . &quot;
once the DVI ; -@@ file was created can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file can be converted . simply try and fun .
&quot; DVI e V ice l I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF @-@ converting or computer @-@ screen . &quot;
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - if the printer can be printed ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set right ) .
the tool@@ bar che@@ ating the conversion of the DVI ; -@@ file created in other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text is able to begin the conversion into the tool@@ bar in the tool@@ bar .
the precau@@ tions reserve the direct jump from the editor for the corresponding position inside the DVI . -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ z . this must only be set to set Modern under settings K@@ ile ... tools B@@ auen .
&quot; for watches the we@@ avers , the mouse must be positioned in a line of the source text , and should be cli@@ cked on for@@ wards . the jump to the corresponding location in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is so@@ ot@@ ted . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile . this must be set up &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; Oc@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor set up ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece set up ... editor )
&quot; if the case should not appear on the case of fre@@ ading the &amp; DVI ; -@@ vie@@ wers can not lie , this should be a mistake , this will appear in the log file , or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the log file contained the error source in the source text . in the editor you can see the line , in which the error appears . to see the faul@@ ty line , must be cli@@ cked on the faul@@ ts in the log line and ch@@ ile ; jump to faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once upon the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose the template for the document . the aforementioned features are : &quot;
&quot; when choosing empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the assistant for a quick creation of a new document . more information can be used in the section . &quot;
&quot; multilingual users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be made in &amp; c@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; -@@ file will be built or a new file may create a new template by means of an existing document and selection of a document templates . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , a template is replaced by file , some string can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or text coding ) . these variables can set up in settings K@@ ile ... settings must be set up . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ ER ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is used by entering into documentation category . typically , it is used as : \ \ Rap@@ id &#91; $ $ DO@@ ME ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of assist@@ ants , and thus verb@@ ali@@ zations of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , then the own template can be selected rather than by default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files , a simple way to create a template , should be sought after one on the Internet and which are described under described steps . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and her@@ b@@ ens of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be done in men@@ Ã ¼ Tools directly out &amp; k@@ ile .
&quot; to learn more around &amp; Kate ; and its features , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start right there with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; Kate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ instruction reference , which can be called for the help of La@@ TeX reference . you can find a detailed description nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can be found as well as their syntax . &quot;
a double @-@ click with penet@@ rated Str@@ g -@@ button to locate the &amp; tex ; -@@ word meaning that in this way clicking on \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par excellence .
&quot; when entering the text with penet@@ rated lin@@ ker , the full text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
when using the arrow buttons with penet@@ rated ren@@ ch taste can be seen parts of the source text in the editing window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the most varied kinds of sources . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
many assist@@ ants can be included in the text box . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ Ã ¼ tr@@ Ã ¤ ge editing marks or the corresponding short@@ mark is also highlighted that when the first input of a character is automatically shifted .
&quot; the mach@@ ining is probably one of the major aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; though &amp; Kate ; already excellent features , were added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . among mach@@ inations , the following commands may contain : &quot;
&quot; outputs a complete paragraph ( group of lines , contained on both sides a blank line ) . this extended meaning un@@ covered with it tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of source text . the only preventive thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; therefore , that the abbrevi@@ ation is separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; then the word under the current C@@ urs@@ or@@ position consists of . this selection also has an advanced meaning , since this command also has &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a cau@@ tious star ( * ) in the end . &quot;
&quot; to elev@@ ate a part of the document it can be removed from this first and by pressing the button Ent@@ ries , K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers its own instruction for a faster result . under mach@@ ining discharge , the following commands may contain : &quot;
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to mach@@ ining excer@@ pts .
it has already been pointed out that environments plays a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for other commands under mach@@ ining environment for a simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command is ch@@ opped at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the command to be used in the area .
with this command to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to the bub@@ bles of the surroundings .
if the c@@ ursor before or within the command \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s } is located at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; with the input of many entr@@ ust@@ ed ambient instruction can quickly be lost from across the above . this command will not stop the last , so that the mer@@ ged ambient structure is not dis@@ solved . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups which are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } are a few important commands to suit those from mach@@ ining .
&quot; with this command , at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp . &quot;
with this command to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp .
&quot; if the c@@ ursor before or behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ Group # is , becomes the other end of the group we@@ ave ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many entr@@ ust@@ ed groups brack@@ ets can quickly be lost in order to go back soon . this command will not stop the last group , so that the mer@@ ged structure of &amp; tex ; -@@ groups does not destroy . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple application for purpose is used in &amp; k@@ ile . for the pur@@ ging of the purpose is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for the purpose of the purpose is used . &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
this automatic en@@ rol@@ ment of double quotes can be set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ TeX and be retired .
you can also use L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French bad@@ ges are available .
&quot; in the wir@@ es of Shi@@ ft ; entrance door for a smart c@@ aving house ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , for example the current position within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
inside a table @-@ environment close &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an un@@ lock @-@ up clo@@ cking break down .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments to support . these can be set up under settings .
&quot; some users describe the columns in tables , and thereby arrange all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) with each other . if this tab@@ ulator is not addi@@ ction ; according to the tab@@ ern@@ acle of tab@@ ern@@ acle in the following line . although this tab@@ ulator is not the outside , for the columns of the current Tab@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate , has already been a good source code of understanding , it was built in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) all of these modes are available for different ways of working under settings . all these modes are set up for all of these modes . &quot;
&quot; when you start a new environment by means of the command \ \ , { Sur@@ round@@ ing } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; the last letter of the entry is the last letter of the input and therefore , the complete letter of the input will be removed . on the other hand , the list may be decre@@ ed by entering another letter also smaller . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameter . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from a commands . alternatively , the descriptions can be folded from &amp; k@@ ile , so that a simply jump to these positions by mach@@ ining jumping brands N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ est spr@@ ing@@ mark is then tr@@ aded . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; Set up ... k@@ ile ; adjust@@ ing settings to these lists . it can be different W@@ Ã ¤ r@@ enter lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ orders as well as walls of the general language @-@ use .
&quot; the command mode is for the complete understanding of environments , and the call of understanding mode will not be added to the sequence . on the other hand , the environments is so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the understanding of the environments . &quot;
&quot; in the call of comprehen@@ sion mode the men@@ Ã ¼ n@@ ect@@ onic environment , or the short@@ cuts of the environment is automatically transfer@@ able and it appears \ \ &apos; s . after that , the ambient temperature can be finished and ended by pressing the entry . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the environment gets automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; det@@ ects that it is a lists environment , is even a first \ \ item command with income . &quot;
&quot; under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; adjust@@ ing settings to these lists . this mode uses the compart@@ ment list of complete mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; support for user @-@ defined lists of copies , which are immediately set up by L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ g@@ ere strings . the lists can be set up by L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ g@@ inger@@ .c@@ wl , in which for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word mis@@ alignment mode is introduced , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; great W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ Ã ¼ cher are not helpful for the automatic understanding of understanding . however , the fact that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ored in a document has been written more than once . thus offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the understanding of all already written walls . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the settings of K@@ ile ... K@@ ile Ver@@ ful@@ lest sl@@ ain . here , the swelling can be specified for the display of the complete understanding . &quot;
&quot; the ful@@ lest files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / the Persian Home @-@ folder / mode ( subscription ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ book ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialogue @-@ containing graphics are designed to provide graphics as simple as possible . for example , the basics of the basics about the graphics formats should be considered and respected . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for example , as PDF files , so you can be re@@ arranged the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools newly arranged and then be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to be able to observe the outcome of the work , it has to be compiled in the source text . all construction tools are group@@ ed in men@@ Ã ¼ s creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source text for vie@@ wers like &amp; Oc@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be converted to the keyboard ; 3 times , by means of Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file turned into a PS file and be treated using old ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the command rapid construction is normally called a viewer according to the comp@@ iling . should not be used in a built @-@ in viewer , so every new window will pop up . &quot;
a new project will be asked for the project New Project .... here is the following information for this project :
&quot; in case of the fil@@ en@@ ames of the window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
&quot; the script function from &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the tubes of EC@@ MAS@@ cript -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in the sen@@ k@@ right body . &quot;
the API @-@ scripts have not yet developed and can be seen in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
&quot; first of all , it must be said that the execution of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods : &quot;
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite distinctive system in which the basic features can be extended by a variety of different packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; textile live ; are supplied with many documents . it contains a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference .
&quot; this is a fully refl@@ ecting Ref@@ ern@@ z for &amp; tex ; and this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather it is ideal for searching for a particular form@@ atting . as it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; c@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til now , the fin@@ des of the right document is not always easy . as simple help offers &amp; tet@@ rah@@ k ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the available documents and excer@@ pts . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories , and the advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or stroke . from &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ clicking with the mouse , or the use of the lease , the viewer for the document . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source text editor used on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ ward ; - and Unix systems ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be used .

&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is named , the file is normally stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even so , the plug @-@ system is very powerful . you can get from the extra functionality immediately and you don &apos;t have to wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . more about it can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we begin using the menu plug @-@ in . this dialog is open : &quot;
&quot; this dialog allows , to manage and add new plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe every &amp; GUI , -@@ element in it : &quot;
&quot; here you can enter the search button . when adding a plug @-@ in , without a storage ort , this path to the addi@@ ction of the plug @-@ in . &quot;
often we work on a project several individuals in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 Project project configuration can be configured .
the name and email messages are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project like team@@ leader as well as sub@@ project ladder .
the user can search for yourself from the list of members of the team who he is . this happens when he looks for the team member from the list and then expresses the button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ fier ) will be published after you are : text .
the top names and the attitude of their own identity are important regarding news and notes . see for more information about comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leader when some particular happens . see in for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that happen if something specific in the project happens . an example would be the up@@ lifting of the opening and closing of the project , such a file would be saved , or a script that has a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the addres@@ see selected in the addres@@ see list . the addres@@ see can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see in which wei such head will be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
&quot; to be notes is simple . it can either be elected a note from the editor &apos;s editor , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by a text text . &quot;
&quot; note can be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nickname of the team manager and sub@@ project sub@@ project should be specified in the respective sectors or sub@@ project sub@@ project , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; top names and roller names are independent of large or minor , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting languages , the DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic is and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings are covered , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta ... . diesel dialog covers some pages that will be treated in each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; related to tags and auto@@ col@@ abor@@ tion can thus be changed .
&quot; large / small tender of tags : large / small tender of automatically sto@@ cked tags . normal wholesale / minor prescription means , the tags are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / de@@ preci@@ ation of attributes : large / small tender of automatically sto@@ cked attributes . normal Groß / minor prescription means , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically conclude : if cancelled , is optional for tags for which the final day is optional , this immediately after it is inserted . &quot;
un@@ optional tags automatically close : as above for all other tags except the simple tags .
&quot; start and end @-@ day automatically , if switched on , the corresponding end day is changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic tracking of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic transformation of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the appropriate coding during the ti@@ pping .
&quot; M@@ IME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es on the detection of different types of files . by means of the Standard , the default data can be recovered . &quot;
standard specification : the coding of newly created or in other ways than with file opening times ( where the coding of the file can be over@@ seen ) . this attitude here is displayed by the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded .
&quot; default DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . but this attitude here is not loaded from the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that in a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . it is not the same as the saving of the file . even for not stored documents , a backup is regularly updated , according to the specified time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Edit@@ ors or your own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
use the window @-@ settings to the default back next start is useful when the user interface got through adjustment of the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message area serves the tax of the possibility to un@@ lock the display of war@@ nings by stopping by no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the sync behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in shared mode . regards the different modes .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the illustration of the Par@@ ser @-@ knots in the document , set out in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse @-@ click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the necessary action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of k@@ not can be opened up in the tree , the actu@@ alisation of the tree with mach@@ ining and how deep in a change of structural tree will be opened automatically . empty knots are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are not found in which the current document has been found no element . &quot;
&quot; the area to define abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which are valid for mach@@ ining too extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , which means a valid group of PHP , in which the if@@ b abbrevi@@ ation is something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plugins are K@@ Part applications of third party which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part application , most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting an plug @-@ in must be given the following : &quot;
&quot; address : the path to the plugin , if it is not on a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib . &quot;
&quot; input : this information is transferred to the plug @-@ in to the start , so it can open the current file , the file folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the store , if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the required information is correct , even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the de@@ bug@@ ging was completely re @-@ developed . di@@ e@@ support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been de@@ bug@@ ging , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of which it was implemented a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept that allows various Impl@@ ement@@ ations about plug @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; altern@@ ate . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the option options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in box you can change the specific settings .
&quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is a de@@ bu@@ gger , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitoring variables is displayed . usually appears in the left Dock .
&quot; a view , in which all attitudes , with foref@@ athers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
&quot; a view , shown in which the issue ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is displayed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ try . this promotion is triggered by default when a project is opened , which must be a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in normal fall does not have to be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or stop the Lau@@ rel according to requirements .
send a HTTP @-@ request to the server to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to watch the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the view de@@ bu@@ gger output .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to start and information about the surveillance variables as well as the current resulted in line . if this happens when the script has been launched , the script starts with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without information on monitoring variables and the current line number , the execution continues . happens before a debit card starts , the execution begins once a requirement is provided . &quot;
&quot; the Debug@@ ger leads the next directive in the script , without entering into the functions or includes . &quot;
&quot; the Debug@@ ger leads the next directive in the script , whereby in case of functions and includes errors . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the directive and go to the next so , as if there were the current one . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the surveillance value appears in the variation @-@ view . &quot;
this dialog can be inserted in a variable or a new value of a variable .

&quot; this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to adapt to your needs and how you can help and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
document@@ ate type E@@ di@@ tor@@ ch ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and Skri@@ p@@ as well as &amp; CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . your simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ develop@@ er , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P : s are available in two types , family 1 , the brand @-@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bar . day @-@ folder contain two data types , the text files and the tool@@ bar . day @-@ tool@@ boxes are handy , symbo@@ lic@@ ated cor@@ sts of sculp@@ tor ( above the E@@ di@@ mal @-@ Fen@@ sters ) , which could insert the text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P : s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; Power@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bar . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and the content of the property , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . work@@ ings allow a fast inser@@ ting of tags into a document without a risk of writing . &quot;
&quot; day @-@ folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; B@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the descri@@ b@@ tion language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and de@@ kl@@ ine whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible to make other users a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is presented in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a meeting document . it can only appear once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only one element type over themselves otherwise nothing else . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument to function . ( only family 2 )
only for the type class is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type of Meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag set . this is a only element type element .
&quot; describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only be described for any attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags you describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element @-@ type element . &quot;
gives the source code used for the attributes in the tag Edit@@ or@@ dialog and in the attribute @-@ tree at
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a chi@@ pper and a methodology . the arguments that are transferred to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag allows the elements of a list together . it can occur only once . it is a single element type element .
determine the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialogue . this day can occur for any attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
is the position and the size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; sheet &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may contain within the defined tags . this element is an only element type .
gives a list of elements that will end a day . this item is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ coding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces are not affecting anything but watch on &amp; and &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaces it . this will fail to be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check the t@@ XML files the tools dialog above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , check only in loading of the Tag@@ XML @-@ files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ day .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; download &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ coding = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; function = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Co@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file is just as simple and there is an editor for this , accessible via DT@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , should be created a simple &amp; nit@@ r@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.01 transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nickname = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname . &quot;
an action can set up with settings for action ... click on New promotion leads to the same dialogue :
&quot; using this action packed key@@ boards . with clicking the button &quot; &quot; user @-@ definition &quot; &quot; button @-@ defined button can be assigned a short@@ cuts ; with one is the current buttons . &quot;
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be inserted a text in the det@@ a@@ illed settings and when carrying out the action this text is inserted in the document to the current c@@ ursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful shareholder type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but there@@ for it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even if the quick start -@@ dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / / removed from the document name . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be used with the P@@ ID of running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this process is used , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script can be used from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to enter the standard input . in the sel@@ ections input can be determined , which is to send to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected range of document is sent to the script . the % input is normally only useful with this attitude .
&quot; according to the input , there are two types of output : normal issue , written on the standard version . it can be specified on the standard version . it can be specified using the text written version , by which the value is set to set the drop @-@ up output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the brand @-@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create an own tool@@ bar . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add promotions and configure options . select Settings promotions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the new action button at the bottom of the window starts the mach@@ ining mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes has and you will plan their use , enable you to edit &quot; &quot; Day &quot; &quot; if available , so that a entry when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ download ; use of the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ download ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select editing size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a Start@@ kno@@ b as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as useless , star@@ ched , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled ; start @-@ up ; -@@ day in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the promotion . this happens over the menu with settings for action ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text box there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder , in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the button button and continue with other tags , so there are still , or confirm with OK to finish off . &quot;
suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar or it should set this for a better overview of some Tr@@ actor into several groups . open the tool@@ bar and adjust the tool@@ bar using the tool@@ bar . make sure that the tool@@ bar selected is selected .
&quot; I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( very left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which shall be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to make a quick way to access the kon@@ quer@@ or P@@ review . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ator support group@@ ing . anyone who knows my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ ving all symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; back in the correct folder . after ren@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be im@@ regular folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder ( s ) should be loaded in the right folder ( s ) , if a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable enlargement of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for normal users , the possibility to add documentation for the scripts , or the form@@ atting language , which you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ document tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory , whether someone has already done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you have to search an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file . first part we leave you to the second , we treat it here . &quot;
&quot; # KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ tion@@ .html . &quot;
the section tree defines the invisible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example you see now in the &amp; PHP . documentation is something :
&quot; # KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements Top element = PHP 4.2 , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents , # getting Start@@ ed , ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ... &quot;
note the # before getting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess tel@@ esc@@ ope ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you remember that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but watch on &amp; and &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resources @-@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ at@@ ters are replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be shown on the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array -@@ function would display the documentation directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connector . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of conf@@ lic@@ ted context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c and save it to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then , create a folder ( like you indicated this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re sure that these are well and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation have been used to use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory , they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places there is an email menu @-@ order , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders , and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded in our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can be reviewed and only available when our team is used as accurate and user for publishing . to make use of a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . hence , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their passport v@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case you have multiple keys you can have a look . in the dialog New resource you have to stay empty ) and with clicking from OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can upload from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plates and Skri@@ p@@ te tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , investig@@ ating &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and Sig@@ nific@@ ation . in the case of problems it war@@ ns and it can be cancelled . if the integrity given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the creation can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of day files in the tag@@ XML format could be necessary . there is the simpl@@ est way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D shop and Conver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which shall be used . afterwards the following dialogue :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defini@@ tions : the string , which in the ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day , like HTML Public - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.01 / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine @-@ setting of the D@@ TE@@ P according to conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; according to the conversion of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand and draw full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this chapter tries to give them precisely these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefits . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use , available . by tool@@ bar on actions everything is marked as global , in the joint ordination structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the administrator of administr@@ ators different work@@ ings , actions and patterns in a global tree , which can then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bar . local items are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything possible by &amp; CSS ; models up to tool@@ bar with special promotions especially for the files of a specific project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are placed in the folder of the project , making the sharing of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the Edit@@ ors window , the construction modules , the cardboard box with information and the tool@@ bar . please hit in , and for further information on these fields . &quot;
&quot; you can click the cart@@ on with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with up to the current document , just delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the Edit@@ ors section lead to a further context menu regarding the mach@@ ined document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste ) , handling of the word under the mouse c@@ ursor or opening the file , if the string is called under the mouse c@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Edit@@ ors , the tool@@ boxes of the Edit@@ ors are now taking place &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bar is shown . in the course of the further construction of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bar are adapted to the new features and associated with it needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ boxes is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; enter the symbol that the day represents , then click on a day that has several attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to open and pier@@ ce them in the information . in the presentation with cardboard boxes are available for files , project , patterns , attributes , attributes , and documentation design . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all the files in the project and allows the administrative of the files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as adding , dischar@@ ging , up@@ loading , or delete the files from memory medium can be performed using the displayed menu menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . the category depends on the related users and templates in projects are available only in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of break@@ down in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information about a script . over the right mouse button , you can start editing additional functions , such as the script to edit or send with an email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ Click of an elementary document , the c@@ ursor is placed on the position of the element . through the right @-@ click of an element opens a list of commands regarding navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other construction views . with it , some can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . that &apos;s the content oriented system allows the change of all available attributes with few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web @-@ technology for your development . it can be used pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two boxes , at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the beneficial information : the news window , and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this cardboard box provides information on each in Qu@@ anta current script . for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this cardboard box shows all the errors in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( so that there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , tool@@ bar are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the Cho@@ col@@ en side of the tool@@ boxes is the opportunity to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other backup and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this conf has a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of options , enter . / configure --@@ help one . the options are easy to understand and not run . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web @-@ development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a rapid Web development and combined with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , began to get the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , expand@@ able market @-@ up editor would be ? well , this would make him absolutely great Web @-@ development tools for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web @-@ development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to be the appropriate &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above @-@ mentioned demand must be det@@ ained that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development aid is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as to expand how they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows Web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . by the programme , they can remember it &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . ( more about it can be found in . ) &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web@@ design environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to a well @-@ engine@@ ered editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .

&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time , if you open a file that is not found on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check in the section about templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project pre @-@ storage folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; convert when inser@@ ting the cli@@ p@@ board there , special characters to the &amp; HTML ; control , so that it is displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as a form@@ atting instruction . &quot;
converted the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ S@@ ai@@ on which is the correct way to add specific characters and space in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
switch the block@@ sel@@ ections to or from . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of &amp; Shi@@ ft ; taste .
&quot; go directly to a po@@ inter number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP , script error messages ! &quot;
looking for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined phrases to help you .
shows the news window or not to . this is the window in which you see the ad of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; initial and adjustment of the problem @-@ por@@ ters at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , main window . the problem re@@ por@@ ter is activated , once you move to struc@@ tur@@ tle . &quot;
&quot; displays the symbols left from the main window , this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse @-@ click . &quot;
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries or neighbour , depending on the position of the c@@ urs@@ ors in the document . &quot;
book@@ mark from other open documents may be group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the file called .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to add files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , e.g. graphics files into your project folder or to add a sub@@ folder and then add it to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are explained on the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you assigned them to this project .
&quot; a dialog to store your tool@@ boxes . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions need to be set up using settings ... or you will be stored about tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , or you are asked when you want to store the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the range . that delet@@ es it not from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ boxes to the main server , where everybody else can access it . &quot;
invite one &amp; DT@@ D ; you have made or anyone else made someone else and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description of the process .
&quot; download / fresh the en@@ dow@@ ments from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it is useful when the en@@ dow@@ ments from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to renew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . if this is global and a typ@@ ing at the global KDE folder is not present , fails to load the shop . &quot;
&quot; this menu includes a list of tags available in the currently charged tool@@ bar . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there are in the tags menu a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day setup dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ tion using tool@@ bar , if this day is contradic@@ tory to this place . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plugins are listed below the above menu cards . click on it . click on a activated plug @-@ ins disabled . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syn@@ dic@@ ation mechanism for the current file . the list of available locations schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; choose the type of po@@ inter @-@ line identification . very useful , if you know people , the other OS platforms to use . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of current document based on selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by means of an external application .
&quot; immediate circulation between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the KDE libraries can cause the switching at times time , or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the default setting mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides for each open sub@@ window an entry . with selecting an arrangement , the corresponding sub @-@ window is activated . &quot;
switch the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affects every application , using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
sets the behavior of the Edit@@ or@@ acle . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
a dialog will appear in which you can delete items from the tool@@ boxes or which can change and change the sequences .
&quot; this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse c@@ ursor , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as in any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out from top to bottom , e.g. after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project can be completed later with Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 project project features can be set . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to include , for example foo . when entering your name file is automatically filled . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small case and with no space signs using web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here you can download the server address of the machine , to which one wants to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log is used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adaptation could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , where the templates for the project is stored . it is a relative path to project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder rather than the standards should be set . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , where the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder rather than the standards should be set . &quot;
this allows files to include files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folder .
&quot; this setting is great if you have st@@ atic web@@ in@@ content , you want to download and change . for ser@@ vers@@ ing script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; when files can be cons@@ ulted anywhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is re @-@ started , not an@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folder are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of your credit . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files required by kick , or by del@@ e@@ tion of the tick , cl@@ ing out of the project . &quot;
the final screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings to simplify your work . these settings can upload in the menu with project properties in the menu window or with the short@@ cut Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional items will be explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames , which can be re@@ viewed in project @-@ related operations such as project folder . &quot;
&quot; suppl@@ em@@ ental option to top , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project display , which will be loaded with the opening of the project . in this way , more about project views can be read . &quot;
&quot; thus , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently , Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the button options . in the de@@ bug@@ ging plugin can be described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles high @-@ loading profiles can be adjusted , as well as the display of a component view for the content of the server for each profile , app@@ ended up an independent construction material for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the Lower team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration you can switch to event actions and add these actions , change or delete . event actions will be executed if a previously defined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced . &quot;
to open a different project you can open project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will display and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project management gives free access to the files in the project . where the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder are also reflected , but are missing the items and opening with ... in with the right mouse button of the header menu : &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the location of the upload files . &quot;
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only longer a profile exists , the button de@@ duc@@ ted to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password will be kept in the core memory and can be forgotten by programming . this possibility is useful when frequent up@@ loading files are needed and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk save -@@ option doesn &apos;t get into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind from the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ ups profiles can be up@@ loaded and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded onto various servers . when editing or creating a profile this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address . &quot;
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . usually this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not manage a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the record , so it can not be easy to read , but everyone can see with programming it easily in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be seen in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view can be loaded and replace the current files and tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings work tool@@ bar , can be opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only improve productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
as mentioned above are works tool@@ boxes in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best use of the tool@@ bar is to be described below . use and adding the tool@@ bar below is treated down in the section Add of tool@@ boxes .
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols on it can be set either using the context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with new action , can ren@@ ame a new tool@@ bar , which can be specified in dialogue , where actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bar ... and settings will be set .
&quot; templates are included in the essential documentary chain , code s@@ cut@@ lets and files to build . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used Tem@@ plates , as a common file system with expand@@ able organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any of the system existing directory in the pre @-@ storage room . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the file system . &quot;
&quot; some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each submission , prior to use . &quot;
&quot; binary is everything that is not pur@@ er text . it can be added any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are included in documents using a link@@ ups ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the deposits under global templates . further information on the Tem@@ plates tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created from any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , special smells of the purpose and organized the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in advance st@@ ree under global templates . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on Jav@@ ascript or Perl basis . some examples are found in the pre @-@ storage room under global templates . see in more information about the templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , they serve as templates for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a com@@ pressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure after Any@@ just ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as a template , save as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; as soon as that is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . take a look at the project tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click file as a template , store a selection as local / project publishers . alternatively , the selection can simply be drag@@ ged with pul@@ ling and indul@@ ge on the construction material . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a pre @-@ storage folder . it can use all file administration functions , such as c@@ ann@@ ess and distr@@ acts or inser@@ ting the file tree from kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can select a folder in the file tree in the file tree , select a name for the template and secure it . by default , the project folder is secured , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates will enable a very target @-@ oriented way . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; in addition , you can insert some things when using templates in projects very profound in mind . &quot;
the pre @-@ stor@@ ing structure in the sub @-@ window Tem@@ plates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / l@@ b / apps / apps / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / apps / qu@@ anta / apps / qu@@ anta / apps / qu@@ anta / apps / qu@@ anta / apps . each of this file corresponds to one of four types of vessels as above .
&quot; to set the behaviour of a folder , click the folder overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties . the following dialogue appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is ab@@ duc@@ ted once El@@ ter@@ one attribute has been lifted . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all besides the regular folders in the pre @-@ storage overview . if a regular folder , it would be explicitly activated , unless they appear explicitly . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text building . if nothing appears , it is probably in a regular folder . &quot;
&quot; this folder , or set @-@ up text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have a text menu ( on it show , right mouse button press ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor that are accessible via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source text editor into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ site and a c@@ ursor . then you can edit and if needed for the source code editor in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor in the source code is visible .
&quot; in working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor in a document , which contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , continues to edit the source text editor . there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that the modifications are visible both in the source text editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ editor syn@@ ch@@ ron is already active , this mode is already active , the keyboard shift the active c@@ ursor from one window to another , where the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
the synchron@@ ization between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source editor is adjustable over settings Qu@@ anta ; -@@ View can be set between synchron@@ ization according to a click or automatically . in choosing automatically the time span can be adjusted in addition to the time span . generally , the recommendation is : a small don@@ key for quick computers and a great sp@@ anne for slow . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , the tool@@ ing features will be created . thus , the processing of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will also be created . this is the case for the suspension of the pad@@ lock . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
&quot; Met@@ a tags allow storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list will allow the change of content , such as key words on the column of name and key@@ word key@@ word . &quot;
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons below the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template by pressing on the file button , and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the c@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , possible by filling with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the c@@ ursor occurs as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and can be deleted using back@@ taste or removal . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ ting tags is made in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor , made . it is to note that the inser@@ ting of tags already existing already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. if an anchor day , has to be inserted with text , everyone needs to be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bar like the tables wiz@@ ard or the lists wiz@@ ard are disabled , they will later be in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release must be used the tables or lists of tool@@ boxes . &quot;
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for the study of Stil@@ ts . in contrast to other programs for styles are the search for certain elements possible and the execution of the box system can be prosec@@ uted .
&quot; to re@@ compile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully compile , need apart from &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already present . &quot;
stop in a template at a place in one of x@@ sl@@ db@@ g loaded styles or x@@ ml file or at the current k@@ not . new in x@@ sl@@ db@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db @-@ compatibility mode can be set @-@ ai@@ ded view@@ points in a particular file and po@@ inters number and later be activated .
x@@ sl@@ db@@ g contains the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path@@ ogen . fil@@ en@@ ames loaded in the same folder as the top loaded box system . / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a lecture called QNAP ME or a specified mod@@ us@@ names can be checked . &amp; eg ; template is agreed with any QNAP ME , which the string is included . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; QNAP ME &quot; is extended according to the rules which specified in the X@@ SL source file . X@@ SL : test@@ 1 is extended &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a noted brack@@ et has to be solved for the per@@ tin@@ ent UR@@ I and Zei@@ l@@ enn@@ number . this will be executed automatically when charging the first template by x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . this will be re @-@ reviewed shortly after the start of each cycle .

there are lots of graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
&quot; the co @-@ operation was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ory many changes made and at the same time corrected it . a further programmer had changed in the same file a lot of text . the result were numerous conflicts in bringing together . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no evidence on the places where maybe only the objection had changed . that changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later a lot more useful features were added .
&quot; if you wish to compare text for example , just copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the compar@@ ing window . &quot;
a function which made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost to a complete file browser .
also 3 @-@ way assem@@ blies is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently from each other at a piece of co @-@ work and make changes . the original file helps the dis@@ solve changes . this editor allows you to edit the result directly . the screens@@ hot shows three quantum files at the same time :
&amp; cut@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also in the compar@@ isons and merge complete folder . this screens@@ hot is showing &amp; cut@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder @-@ assembled :
&amp; cut@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and be@@ di@@ ct the possibilities of today &apos;s pig@@ ment monitors . if you often have to verify Ko@@ de you will like this feature .
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible visible . if the lines are only different in a certain number of white signs , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no hass@@ le more , if J@@ em@@ and the inhal@@ ation changes . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in a row , then the color indicate which file is different . red color means that both are different files . &quot;
&quot; if all the files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily find yourself the typ@@ ing work by typ@@ ing the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ use 3 folder 1 folder 2 folders , folder 2 folder , 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder . &quot;
&quot; the opening dialog allows the manual en@@ type of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting from the file browser . the opening dialog notice your choice and displays them next time . you don &apos;t have to give the entry for C , the analysis of the differences are performed with two files . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons will be selected , for B and C , however a folder , then uses &amp; cut@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A into the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merge is crossed , the input field is active for target and can be dealt with . however , it is not necessarily required to set out immediately a output file . you can do this step later in the store . &quot;
placing the button open a dialogue with settings . here you can set options before you begin with the compar@@ isons .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select some files from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts then you do not have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the dis@@ rup@@ ture button . &quot;
you can also use pul@@ ling and distr@@ acted : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let him fall over a comparison window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains like several similar features . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would only load two corresponding files , they &apos;d just load them in &amp; none . now you can copy the relevant sections just paste and then compare . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you cannot draw anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop of text into a compar@@ ative window is supported . &quot;
&quot; warning : some editors interpre@@ ting the pul@@ ling and flow of text into another program as ex@@ cl@@ ing and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the po@@ inters number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) J@@ ede Info @-@ Line has a while on the line . then a small aid window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three sources are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this preference settings may be changed over the Settings menu ) . &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one sees in the color that file is different . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) well . &quot;
&quot; links to the text is the case column . if differences were found , the column shows the appropriate color . with differences in white signs , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , B. are white characters only in strings and comments , for the processor and in a few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that separates the inter@@ constitutional column of text is interrupted at the places where the particular source file has no lines . when the line @-@ file is activated , the line indicates the surrounding lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the compar@@ isons ) also has a info line with the wor@@ ding issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; changed &#93; when you have edited the result it already contains text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ solved is the stor@@ ey de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons Spr@@ inge to next stem / un@@ resolved conflict to find even remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
by a click with the left mouse button in one of the windows the line belonging to the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this group will then be highlighted the current group . ) This group will then be highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for current area and each left appears a black @-@ beam .
&quot; sometimes , through the automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing , no more line will be left in the group ; then this is only a unit for the event that you may change your opinion and maybe choose another source . this text appears either in the final file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might copy and paste it differently . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; gathering con@@ versions ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : if the sources ignore the options ignore or ign@@ oring Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in figures or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates primarily with the image and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard on the left , right , high , down , bottom , string @-@ start and Str@@ g end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the Over@@ view column next to the vertical image bar can also be used to navigate . &quot;
&quot; in the Aug@@ ab@@ ef@@ en@@ ster you can also use the other keys to edit . using the inser@@ ting button , you can switch between one and over@@ write mode . ( pre @-@ set is the input mode ) . &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the database columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the top of each group ( as already in the section together and the ed@@ itable output for@@ ks was explained ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation by which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / v@@ ori@@ gen conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ picture above ) or to the next / v@@ ori@@ gen un@@ resolved conflict . therefore , between sol@@ uble and uns@@ ol@@ ved conflicts can be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copying -@@ button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g inser@@ tion ) . be careful with this option but if you could send so the content of the cli@@ p@@ board acci@@ dentally . &quot;
po@@ inters are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variants use a po@@ e@@ plate sign \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the foref@@ athers of the source files not at , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved automatically and restored next time . ( menu settings &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog includes fonts with adjust@@ . width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in Kur@@ si@@ ver script are shown . if the selected script does not support this representation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colours could not be available in their pure form but would be log@@ ged in . on these systems , the button @-@ settings automatically puts an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , when pressing the tab@@ ulator button is inserted the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the entry or return , the submission of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board then falls . &quot;
you can select which po@@ e@@ ading type you prefer to save . the pre @-@ set value is the generally used selection on the operating system .
&quot; in the compar@@ ing of files temp@@ ted &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines can be ignored in the source files . only during this first step may be ignored every line . in this step , white signs are not ignored . also , white signs are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a wagon line &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored and k@@ diff@@ use &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the wagon is made visible , however , as a white sign is dealt , however , as a white sign is dealt with . during the default this option must be disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . however , the differences are still shown , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
in the default this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensi@@ vely for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective at complicated and big files but slowly with very large files .
&quot; in the Autom@@ atic @-@ finishing mode , this attitude determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is continued . &quot;
&quot; if you need to use automatic all conflicts in white signs using the chosen file as a source . ( pre @-@ set is manual selection . ) That &apos;s more useful when white signs are used in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ign@@ oring Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments . &quot;
these options are dealt with in chapter for scanning by folders and runs an assem@@ bling . look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and assem@@ blies .
&quot; if a file is stored and already a older version exists , then the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a back@@ up@@ file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , this will be deleted without any further backup . &quot;
&quot; changing the language of the user interface . changing this option does not include the current current program . you have to finish and rest@@ art , so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is used globally via the Control Center . ) &quot;
the following en@@ coding settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you activate this option is used for all entries the top settings .
over the sel@@ ections for the coding appears a short notice of what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has purely informal nature . )
&quot; adjust the file coding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted as the en@@ coding for each file can be individually adjusted , even files can be compared with different en@@ coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which en@@ coding to be used to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define precau@@ tions , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be set with 8 @-@ bit ASC@@ II . ) with this option one can specify the en@@ coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
&quot; turn off to supp@@ ress her@@ b@@ ances of changes in white characters in the text or over@@ views . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences are displayed in a colour@@ ful bo@@ iled column column . but sometimes you want to see only the differences between two of three files ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C is displayed beside the normal nor a second over@@ sight column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . bl@@ aming simply the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu ) .
orders the comparison window next to each other or over@@ one another . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu ) .
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the assem@@ bling and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as a pre @-@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the file again , then the name of the most recently used output file . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is handed over to this external command . in &amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the instruction will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own preferences , which is exactly your requirement . you can use this function e.g. to cut disturbing parts or for correc@@ ting the inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is specified only when writing this command command . you can write your own prec@@ essor using exactly your requirements . each entry line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to allow users more flexibility when inser@@ ting the di@@ ff results . however , there is an external program needed , and most users want this not even program@@ m@@ able . however , the good news is however , that in most cases sed or perl is completely out@@ sour@@ ced . &quot;
use this pre @-@ editor for lin@@ ders to convert the entry into large letters : sed &apos; s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a erg@@ y@@ ful expression of the text in a row . the \ \ U trans@@ forms the found text in large letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key passwords to add automatically ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all following the same pattern is required : sed &apos; s / \ \ $ \ \ ( revision ) \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ \ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; _ _ \ \ &apos;
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you may like these regular expression even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ign@@ ant of numbers is actually a already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another demonstration command for lin@@ ders . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 9@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Je@@ des sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , so virtually deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to carry several re@@ ali@@ zations at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different like perl . perl -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ rors / switches . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires perl only ( and ) without the &quot; &quot; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
data according to the normal Pre@@ processor will be kept for viewing and merge . the further operations only change the data that the Zei@@ len@@ ab@@ equ@@ als Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases when you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the po@@ inter @-@ ser@@ essor sees the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or differences , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
often you need to edit programmers in a folder many files . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ ates and merge .
... makes a suggestion for every object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can simul@@ ate the simul@@ ated and shows the simul@@ ated changes without having really perform ;
... runs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) , &quot;
this is similar to the compar@@ isons and merge of individual files very similar . you just need to specify a folder on the command line or enter the dialog file .
&quot; when three folder are assembled , folder 1 is used as a basis . if no destination is specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target @-@ folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not match that . to match that , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during the reading of the folder you will receive a little news window about the current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed until then compared . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side ... &quot;
each file and every folder of the scan found in a tree is displayed here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded . you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrows to left / right . the folder menu includes two functions All sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories , with which you can catch up all the folder . &quot;
&quot; click on a file , the file will be started immediately and it appears a compar@@ ative window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the dat@@ at@@ ype in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the dat@@ at@@ ype vary depending on the other folder , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . if that will be launched , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above picture is used in the columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder are regarded as identical as its entire content is identical . then , the folder also have the same color . when folders , age is un@@ significant for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a blue which is only green , then yellow is yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not a : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects can exist , this cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B does not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if A is a folder and B ) : errors : conf@@ lic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects can exist , that cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ izing is active , if only two folder and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; cut@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folder are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user can see as the visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; direct after which are assembled &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are assembled and the option Neu@@ ere file will be activated ( uns@@ afe ) , then the date of the files are different , but the same date appears , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; while the one has worked together a file after the other . it has done a copy , if that collap@@ sed successfully , and according to other messages , if something im@@ expected , you should make a final review and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the interior dialog , the file compar@@ ative method is chosen , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ uble , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts will only be displayed when three folder are compared or together . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the comp@@ el actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can run it together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a target folder , then in three @-@ folder mode C is used as the target , the two @-@ folder system will be chosen and used when synchron@@ izing A and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries are displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure , there are several options to avoid over@@ ar@@ est surprises : &quot;
to perform all entries : pick up / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cuts ) . to perform only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conf@@ lic@@ ting data types still exist , a message appears to the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you perform all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options running , simul@@ ate and break . &quot;
&quot; to simul@@ ate if you want to see what happen would happen , without the really changes to be made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then introduces certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screens@@ hot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , you will again start direc@@ ting again , continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialogue will appear . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to make a mistake , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . you have the possibility to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in any way before you continue to merge with . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually assembled , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these messages ( in the current session ) and results in later together the entries are not saved . even if you have summ@@ ed the merge action , these entries are carried out again , these messages are once again mer@@ ged . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory assem@@ blies with these options :
&quot; only files that are shown on the indicated patterns are shown in the sub@@ tree . you can separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid space @-@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder must not match the pattern . &quot;
&quot; files and folder that correspond to this pattern will not appear in the sub@@ tree . it may display more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a partition . valid space : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folder that correspond to this pattern will not appear in the sub@@ tree . it may display more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a partition . valid space : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file may be set . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore ) .
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files one ali@@ zations -@@ attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems marks a set of a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are shown in the sub@@ tree or not . this option is switched on the default .
&quot; if the option is switched off , symbolic links will be compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched off , the links such as normal folder are dealt with and recur@@ sively . a link to a folder of a link on himself would lead to a final loop , and &amp; cut@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; introduces a complete analysis of each file through and displays statistics columns , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and substantially slower when used on files which does not contain text . ( type an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; if you compare a large folder via a slow network , it may be quicker to compare the ch@@ angel@@ ist and the file size . however , this speed advantage cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is folded in default . &quot;
&quot; much like familiar to the ch@@ angel@@ ist . there is no real comparison to change . the files are regarded as identical , if they are equal to the copying of ch@@ angel@@ ist . please use caution . this option is folded in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the sync mode when two folder are compared and no target folder are specified . in this mode , the proposals are displayed simultaneously . also the results of the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is placed in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences exist , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is regarded as uns@@ ure as it is assumed that the other file is not also changed . ) This option is switched in the default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted , the original Backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g Exten@@ sion is already existed , this is also deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal connected files . this option is switched on the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder lines stays visible where individual files remains visible ; you can switch off the window pieces with the mouse . if you do not want to switch off the window parts in the window , and switch from a change between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking on the menu . however , you can use a single file also directly together without using the folder file , and the file will not run once again if you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost when you read the directory again : directory -@@ menu : new to read &quot;
&quot; KDE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folder for opening that are located on local or remote host machines . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a zi@@ pped archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax of local files and folder . a few things should you consider :
&quot; a path may be relative , or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ c@@ ated . ( # - &gt; % 23 , id@@ den@@ - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol . there is a short list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder indicates , then always a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no possibility to edit permission or change date . therefore , the permission or change of change from the original . ( note the option familiar to the size . ) ( this is only possible in local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first the built @-@ in differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . to launch K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences @-@ viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ .@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as K@@ Part , the input file is a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
in kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu P@@ review - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this is not working if any of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ ing of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that , or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now Hei@@ st it comp@@ are ) are already available . furthermore the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can bring together as the program diff@@ use 3 from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection .
I have been using GPL @-@ programs for a long time and I learned a lot by having taken into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone the way or go it to him .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources , and the configure script should not be the right pre@@ fix for KDE . in the default installed configure in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ .@@ ui@@ .@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more detailed information on this issue . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters are different , these lines are viewed as identical ones ; if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if the lines will appear next to each other , this regard is , but this is the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor is noted for any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source text and ex@@ its of the button A / B / C . this important information is lost , if the result is simply saved as text file , and it is too much effort to create an own file format which may store this information . &quot;
the effort for this has been too big . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit a larger quantities of text should be used another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ter ; published and the text cannot delete it . what does it mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to highlight differences . even more her@@ nia would be conf@@ using and lacking the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and trou@@ bles@@ hooting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all features of &amp; k@@ diff@@ use , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or higher . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ users on other platforms without KDE please visit the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net / ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf@@ using and autom@@ ake , you should have no problems while comp@@ iling . should nevertheless difficulties occur , please report the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ ists thereof . &quot;
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or revers@@ al removal ) copies in the fields marked and delet@@ es the marked text . insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current C@@ urs@@ or@@ position and replaces the current mark@@ ings .
&quot; only differences are displayed : files that are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently also not in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you must read after changes to these options the folder with the function Update . )
&quot; there are only entries displayed , the differences exist . this also causes identical files to be copied in the target folder . if the Target folder these files are not already mentioned , they are likely to be modified in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for selecting the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the buttons , the lines are attached from the appropriate window to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed while clicking the button . &quot;
in the default this option is disabled . under@@ differences in individual signs ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like the differences in white characters .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini show of all virtual spaces . it is quite convenient to see the current programs on the work@@ spaces , to change their size , to end them or shift them . this works in a desktop and also with several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual spaces , as well as the applications for running applications . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and another . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; you click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; folded , the icon and name of the application as well as the entries will maxim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and payment . the commands do the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . if only appears when an application has been cli@@ cked .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when an application has been cli@@ cked .
&quot; this approach is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; it can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , will be displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; tick this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual work@@ surfaces . it is shown along with name , the names with Or@@ din@@ al@@ ises are provided , &amp; eg ; first work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of every desktop is also shown as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed in order to make their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simple shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 4x@@ n re@@ aster , it shows all virtual spaces in a horizontal section , which is very well suited for the representation of the side on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to P@@ ager Mini@@ ature program in the control bar . he has the advantage that it can be changed in size , the windows as symbols or with its content can be displayed and post@@ p@@ one . besides , he runs outside the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and then select setting up a switch set up ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at present , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you don &apos;t have to register as a user root or login to your system administrator . in this file , you must register the key win@@ dow@@ ment fashion and assign a value . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of KDE package packages . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; km@@ ag ; a part of the screen saver , as if you use the newspaper a magni@@ fier for the small printed or the exact view of a photo . these documentation include artists , Web @-@ designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; km@@ ag ; &quot;
&quot; km@@ ag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly being extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; km@@ ag ; start , appears a window as shown above . the main window of &amp; km@@ ag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window is shown as a magni@@ fying window .. The picture , which is shown in the screen window , is described below as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting is enlarged &amp; km@@ ag ; the area around the Mou@@ se@@ ver like a movable magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can show a select screen in the magni@@ fier window ( selection tool ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor on the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse c@@ ursor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the c@@ ursor on the mouse . at present , you are not able to recognize the form of the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor ; this is always the default device ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse c@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ box mode , you can adjust the selection window to your needs . you can move it with the arrow and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse button in the enlargement window and keep the left mouse button down , so you can catch the content of the magni@@ fier and post@@ p@@ one . this also goes with the arrow buttons . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally push the &amp; Shi@@ ft ; taste press or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ window remains firmly stand and only the lower right corner to move . &quot;
&quot; km@@ ag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , to put into a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more . &quot;
starts and stopping the update of the ad . you can update the update that the required CPU time goes against 0 .
&quot; select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , sc@@ oring , means , high , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
in this mode a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; km@@ ag ; uses automatically your installed short @-@ command to save files , opening a new window , prints , rel@@ o@@ unce ( with the button @-@ button again loading in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and decre@@ asing &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; km@@ ag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen magni@@ fier , so you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefit : from research , or artists to web@@ designer or visual impair@@ ments . &quot;
detailed user &apos;s documentation can be found with help : / km@@ ag ( give either this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ help@@ center help : / km@@ ag ) .
&amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; has been developed by O@@ la@@ f Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ midt @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are sar@@ ang @ us@@ ers@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster For@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ .de .
&quot; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse c@@ ursor a while on the same place har@@ dened , it is thought to help people who suffer at R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ inflammatory syndrome ) and those of each mouse @-@ click pain . &quot;
&quot; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , once the mouse c@@ ursor a while on the same place har@@ dened . it &apos;s meant to help people who em@@ ulate at the Re@@ peti@@ tive enzy@@ me ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse @-@ click pain . also , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that comes when clicking the mouse , and helps such a lot of men to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also use pain associated with the use of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not yet to happen . &quot;
&quot; to make it even clear@@ ing : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; sor@@ eness helps , which is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against sor@@ eness , which is caused by means of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result may vary for each different . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and introduces a mouse @-@ click as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement shortly .
&quot; is the smart rel@@ oc@@ ating power , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it gets the pressing of the mouse . now move the mouse , it wa@@ its until the end of the movement , before the slogan of the mouse button is run . this way you can perform a little practice , but you get used to get used to it quickly . &quot;
&quot; this denial must suff@@ ice after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse @-@ click . &quot;
&quot; is Int@@ ellig@@ ent Exten@@ sion is switched on , the shooting of sho@@ ots ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is shut down , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after delivery of the mouse is waiting , before it fails to release the mouse , if no means of mouse is done . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; supports now the clicks by mouse exp@@ ul@@ sion . this function is now activated by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow plane is saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt ; the first time started , but they can change later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can shor@@ ten the response time , go to sound &amp; Multimedia , select a sound system and here the rider general . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer , which you set to shor@@ ten to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this option is marked , is &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . with GNO@@ ME or other window environments , please check out the respective documentation rate to figure out how you automatically launch a program . &quot;
&quot; sets all the settings to the values back when opening up the dialog , you have already pressed the button to apply the settings following the last pressures of the dialog . &quot;
&quot; the best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first using the preference . in particular , the intelligent bon@@ ding should be activated first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later hin@@ ge the intelligent bon@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary necessary to reduce the response times by &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should consciously make yourself aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect is : the click on the neutral constitu@@ ents of windows or on sites in the browser window that does not represent a link , does not cause any link , nor do you want to use the mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse rests , you ought to clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you are not just the mouse @-@ ball clean , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as that happens , is different from mouse to mouse . it should be quickly clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the sphere was inserted . dirt and dirt can easily demol@@ ished with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks down the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just begun a failure , that means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the operation is no longer ending by the slogan of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , using a different window manager and post@@ p@@ one window . &quot;
the solution to this problem is that you can perform a mouse @-@ click . here is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run a mouse clicks and putting the c@@ ursor to another position . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the c@@ ursor to place where you want to have it . but , do not park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you encounter a keyboard interface . secure zones for the mouse c@@ ursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas for the mouse c@@ ursor and menus and the cover lines from windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with smart rel@@ oc@@ ating , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent bon@@ ding is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time , before you want to handle it . it &apos;s very comfortable to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and want to add or any other action when you want to move the mouse over . here are some advice about it : &quot;
&quot; if you do not use the intelligent bon@@ ding , if you just start using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; just select text instead following this : execute the envel@@ oping button , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and there again the mouse button de@@ pressed . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is every time , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so you know exactly when in the smart rel@@ oc@@ ating the shooting . later , you can also use the smart c@@ ursor without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but for this requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use , the X@@ test extension needs to be installed for &amp; X Window ; it should be the case in most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound@@ card and speakers and it is correctly decorated .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; then , the mouse @-@ mouse @-@ mouse , as soon as the c@@ ursor . this program was developed for people that are suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome and those suffering of the mo@@ aning pain . &quot;
&quot; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that a certain time is waiting for that a pul@@ ling process starts , before the mouse button is released . in this way the pul@@ ling and flow can be performed with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; km@@ outh ; is a program with the m@@ ute users can speak their computers for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; km@@ outh , m@@ ute users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk of propositions which should be spoken once again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screens@@ hot ) enter the command , which is later used for voice &apos;s voice . further details can be found in the description of the tool . &quot;
&quot; on the second page you can select the standard text @-@ manual work@@ book . from the text pass@@ ag@@ itation , you can often choose the text pass@@ ag@@ ings without having to tap into . the text pass@@ ages may of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right of the screens@@ hot ) , you determine the dictionary documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can deny the list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can get the word list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; km@@ outh is clear and contains essentially a input field for the short@@ cuts of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screens@@ hot ) and an or@@ bit memory of the already spoken propositions ( the upper white field in the screens@@ hot ) .
&quot; if you have km@@ outh , correct , you can enter into the input field the sentences , which you want to hear . each lined sentence is app@@ ended to the se@@ aling memory . you can choose from these propositions which are to be spoken once again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings of km@@ outh ; Set up ... open the entry dialog of &amp; km@@ outh ; this dialog contains two boxes cards , voice output and settings , the page of vocabulary , as well as the site of K@@ TT@@ SD language . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of cardboard card , enter the command to the call of voice @-@ generator . in the selection field below the input field , you specify the text en@@ coding to be shared with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; km@@ outh ; knows two types to pass the text . select the box field , if the text is to be distributed as default to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ box is not selected , the text is shared as a parameter . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command will depend on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with the kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service is used &amp; km@@ outh ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings on this page will be further developed . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection of the action after the selection of a text circuit , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cuts or by choosing a text track in the menu text pass@@ ag@@ ation or in the cor@@ ridor for text@@ books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text line is inserted directly and added in the box memory . with the selection of into the input field the chosen text line will be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection of the turn@@ table of the turn@@ table window , you can specify if the text @-@ server book in the closing of the turn@@ table will be automatically saved . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text pass@@ ag@@ ation , the book is stored . if you select changes , the text @-@ password is not stored . if you want to change it , the text @-@ password will be saved . ask if the text @-@ password is to be saved . &quot;
the page Wor@@ ker &apos;s page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the absence of dic@@ tion@@ aries . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; km@@ outh ; a selection field if this list is more than a dictionary . with this sel@@ ector you can choose the currently used dictionary for vocabulary .
&quot; with the buttons on the right side you can delete or add the sequence of books , or export them into a file . below the list , you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; for this source you choose the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh , then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by ab@@ norm@@ alities of the appearance . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , to include just written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh , asking what dic@@ tion@@ aries are assembled and how this weight@@ ed shall be . &quot;
&quot; with this option you place a new , le@@ eres dictionary without entries . da &amp; km@@ outh ; new words inserted words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main area of the window for the processing of Text@@ pass@@ ag@@ ü@@ ders is two @-@ divided . in the upper part the text @-@ fit books are shown as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text track , you can change the text line or the associated key@@ boards . if you have selected a text @-@ manual , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions such as new text @-@ passages or books add or delete selected text @-@ passages and books , you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a pop@@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; the sequence of text @-@ passages or text @-@ passages , you can change by drag@@ ging using the mouse to the new site or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the store @-@ storage system . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the box . &quot;
&quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is located in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the course of memory . &quot;
&quot; this menu is enabled , a postpon@@ able tool@@ bar with buttons for commonly used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default across the editing window directly under the menu bar . by mouse @-@ click on the raf@@ ters left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position . &quot;
&quot; this menu is added , is a narrow cor@@ pse in the lower part of the main window with hints on the state of &amp; km@@ outh . displayed , if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu is enabled , a postpon@@ able cor@@ relation is shown above the mach@@ ining window directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ click on the sli@@ mming left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position . &quot;
&quot; probably you have entered the command for voice edition right or not completely entered . open settings km@@ outh ; set up settings , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice @-@ over@@ s on the map voice . ( see the dialog dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer to further details . ) &quot;
&quot; festival is a language issue of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is supported . the license allows it to use the festival for free and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival in the folder / usr / local / festival is installed . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a common language generator . currently , it only supports the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . the language issue is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must submit data as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to cr@@ ush the text in ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assum@@ ing that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA can be installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to use the last sign of the text so that an additional character has to be added . the full command is therefore more time @-@ consuming than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / dev / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the option data should be submitted as default .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ more language service , which is available for voice @-@ over@@ s ; K@@ TT@@ SD is currently developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice @-@ over@@ s systems . &quot;
&quot; as the setting of voice @-@ generators only occurs in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as desktop @-@ service as a language service in &amp; km@@ outh . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service , which appears in the setup dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; appears , if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; successful , you need a voice generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; requires about 15 MB storage ( and in addition memory for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration . &quot;
&quot; km@@ outh ; is an application , with the people who can not speak to have text through computers . it &apos;s a list already saved by calcul@@ ators , which the users can always return again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh . no language syn@@ thesizer contains . on the machine a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&quot; marriage you can use &amp; desktop , you need to install and set up program Spe@@ ech discs and set right . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no actors are furnished , the card card spokes@@ person will be displayed . see also . if you have at least a spokes@@ person , the card card is shown general . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or such that is defined in volume or speed . you can also set up several variations for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least establish a spokes@@ person before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesi@@ zers are comparable to several printing applications for the same printer .
&quot; click on the cardboard box in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the map card speakers will be displayed . this appears also automatically when you are kt@@ t@@ sm@@ s and still no spokes@@ person is set up . &quot;
&quot; all the already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice @-@ over@@ s , if an application does not pres@@ enter any speaker . &quot;
&quot; select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list below . the order of the speakers in the list also determines its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; desktop system ;
&quot; choose a vote type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ c@@ - and girl &apos;s vote . &quot;
&quot; click here , appears on the new spokes@@ person on the cardboard card spokes@@ person . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already you can use it . go back to map and check whether language over@@ s ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed out , so that the T@@ TS @-@ Service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . now you can use text card orders to create and manage text files . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language output system of &amp; k@@ de ; start to open the box map to open this map card . here you can adjust some general options . &quot;
&quot; highlight this ti@@ cking field to activate the &amp; desktop system . this start is successful , the card @-@ T@@ TS Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is successfully displayed , and you can create text presentations and read them . see . remove the mark@@ ings , K@@ TT@@ SD , and the T@@ TS @-@ System by &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;

&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ voltage lines and other invisible brands also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate , the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text here . then review the text , which is to be read , and select in the main menu tools Text . then the voice @-@ over@@ s should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; Kate , is embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will notify you of the events of this news by you . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ on .
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different kinds of messages . for example , you can establish a message when in an IR@@ C channel , you can notify me that you can read the IR@@ C script text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu item noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for drawing belts offer a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; wrong , the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is available for delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you removed the tags br and b from the news that can send mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases than provided . read about it too . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in fil@@ tering , text will be processed , before it will be sent to the Spe@@ ech discs program . they are useful for improving the prono@@ unce , to select a suitable language and speaker or to deal with certain shortcomings of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ars has the highest priority . it is pre @-@ drawn to all other orders and holds this orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the release of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the release of the warning .
&quot; News , the next highest priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of one application to read the news . while you &apos;ll find a long text on a website , you can greet you with &amp; km@@ outh , who is just listening to the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text entries . each order which you encounter from cart@@ on card orders , is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that have text files . text entries are intended for the issue of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application fails to read the output of a screen carrier . just one such reads , this issue will be stopped and ended . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen tubes . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , news and text entries as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot;
filter addresses the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; drawing belts are replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify parts of a text by other text , which allows you to be delivered either as words or as regular expression ( : - ) by text or for the format of messages from &amp; con@@ mail ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former use a X@@ SLT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to a different format is included . are some X@@ SLT files to translation by &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with Interphone optional , you can send orders depending on the text of the text or on the program that send the text on &amp; desktop ; send a female voice to an speaker , you can read text by KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. it can be read . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has set @-@ up rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter sets out that his rules will not apply , he will find the text unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text yield , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ noti@@ fications on &amp; desktop , it will be processed by all the activated filters which are placed on the page below . the processing takes place in the sequence from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of equipped normal filters . a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and will not be used . filter are processed in the line down from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and you will be shown the next button @-@ cat@@ alogs . &quot;
&quot; for setting of text @-@ use fil@@ tering , you need to enter a list of words or regular expression as a compar@@ ative pattern . these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding spare parts . large and small tender is not observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; type for your filter a name . this name allows you to choose any number , it must be distinguished only by the name of the other filter . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expression . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string into the column , and replaces him in accordance with the string . the list is processed from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to move the distinctive word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file to save the current list or delete it . download a list from a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language listed here , the filter is used only when the speaker speaks for the text entry one of the languages noted . click on the button to show a list of languages if you hold the mouse @-@ click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is used only when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : convers@@ ational , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID @-@ run programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must be removed . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you can only enter . &quot;
&quot; the string pump filter is applied only to the text when all the conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter is applied if all the input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the text string filter is used in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ding ( space ) . &quot;
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expression . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular expression &amp; # 160 ; trig@@ gers can be installed in the di@@ alogs ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; trig@@ gers can be found in the package of deu@@ ter@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Um@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT files from a format to a different format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such changes . it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the Help Program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c has to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H ranges also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the Interphone filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is placed on the cardboard card spokes@@ person , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can for instance specify that text from k@@ mail from a female voice should be read . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ op@@ ts ; a text sent to the filter , there is a spokes@@ person for the text . the speaker is selected using the speakers , which is the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; send the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; send the text on the cart@@ on card speakers . with the Interphone filter you can write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is applied in case the text is applied to the specified regular expression . is on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; regular phrases installed , you can access this by clicking on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; Set here the characteristics of the desired filter conditions fixed here . if the text is met the above fil@@ tering conditions , the speaker is selected , the speaker is selected , and click the button on the right to show the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
&quot; the competi@@ tor filter is applied only to the text , when all conditions apply with an entry in the box di@@ ciary filter . you need to apply at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , from &amp; k@@ de ; with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS @-@ abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD on &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ops can use this syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice @-@ edition of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility site ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand language services through the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; here , text of the text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are even more commands that you can employ . for a list of all commands you give .
&quot; open two &amp; con@@ sole ; -@@ window . start just kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for the festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in the Festival 1.@@ 95 , you must install the ( Male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ B@@ LE is not working at all . you also need to do that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and to find on the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or fac@@ tions seem to cause errors in syn@@ thesi@@ zers , so all propositions are over@@ clo@@ cked or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure the option string is set to set the correct value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string method . &quot;

&quot; the syn@@ thesizer that are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license , which you can find in the relevant documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that have an own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the KDE source code , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is also available in the folder . furthermore , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ coder under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ en / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page : / / Fac@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net / langu@@ ages@@ .html . &quot;
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
KT@@ TS works with every voice syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages to rate . look at the website of kt@@ ops ; , according to information that are not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech discs &quot; &quot; program uses a customiz@@ able module @-@ architecture for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops ; for the use of any other syn@@ thesi@@ zers , please contact the developer &apos;s team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but is not mandatory . de@@ bian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; order , you need a current development environment of KDE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ ver@@ b and the input files for the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech discs &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source text from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code for k@@ de@@ coder , or have downloaded the tar@@ ball and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first , whether Spe@@ ech disco@@ vers works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . for this , you can use the shell script @-@ conf file . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ oria ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is intended to be developed so that the setting of Spe@@ ech discs directly is possible and the script of the SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is divided into individual propositions . the user can proceed or go back , repe@@ ating the output or ab@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; if an application text is on &amp; desktop , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred Spe@@ aker for the output . thus , you can choose an application for example , whose language English and his sex feminine , this is used , otherwise , the best suitable spokes@@ man is chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a spokes@@ person is chosen , see you in . &quot;
&quot; when you click to add a speaker to the map , and thus enter a speaker in the list or click on editing , the map menu structure will be shown below . for example , the setup of the module for festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found under . &quot;
&quot; type the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . when the path to festival is contained in P@@ AT@@ H , you only need to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text en@@ coding for text , which is handed over to festival . if votes is made automatically . generally speaking , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , most eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders you set volume , intercom speed and pitch @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ator and will not display this grey , the voice you choose does not choose these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded on account of their size . if you mark this cross box , these voices are already loaded with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with greater storage consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thesi@@ zed faster . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ box does not have to be selected , you have not yet to be set up ( or forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; is this analog@@ ical area marked , is visible in the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window t@@ sm@@ s . otherwise , after starting the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this spot@@ ting is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not work , it appears in the system field , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to read the possibility to read or control the item . &quot;
&quot; here all orders in queue are listed , along with the application which has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the only processed proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the cardboard card speakers . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can add @-@ wise in the order which is selected in the list below or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click on OK , all changes of settings ( even on the other boxes ) are taken over and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to a symbol in the system section . then click on this symbol to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the Sound@@ system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text entries are listed and managed . expenditure of screen readers , war@@ nings and messages are not shown . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; can be found in . &quot;
&quot; select here the type of audio @-@ output . if a component cannot be selected , has been compiled &amp; kt@@ op@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audi@@ om@@ o@@ dul or rec@@ tions ; the necessary libraries can not load . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de should be used for the audio edition , select here the audio output . if no output smo@@ other has to be displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have AL@@ SA selected , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; Set the inter@@ phone speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equivalent to half the half and 200@@ X % roughly the double normal inter@@ phone speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click to apply the new settings for the current &amp; desktop system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which equipment works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this map map you can set special actions that will always be executed , if the text yield is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of languages : &quot;
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ars has the highest priority . it is pre @-@ drawn from all other orders and holds this orders . after the issu@@ ance of the screen reader has been read , the orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have priority to the next @-@ year priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning holds the issue of news and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website can be read , you can greet you with &amp; km@@ outh , nevertheless someone can greet you straight in the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text yield is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen converter , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audi@@ oc@@ ated in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played , if a normal text yield is interrupted . if both introductory sound is interrupted as well as introductory message , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this cardboard card will only apply to normal texts . for messages , war@@ nings and issues of screen readers , there are no special promotions if these are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages can be read , launch week@@ s.@@ gr and click messages . &quot;
&quot; highlight this ti@@ cking field to place the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ disadvantage , this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and de@@ duc@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications before . &quot;
&quot; this setting marks is marked , al@@ erts , in which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ops ; not pre@@ read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to list or delete it . if you click on the button Add to add a dialog , where you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
this event reads the message to send the &amp; conversation ; if anyone is mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your n@@ ap .
&quot; all the events , for which in the list is nothing different , are by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
use this selection field to define what &amp; desktop should do if an event arrives . you have the following options :
&quot; if you have selected usability text , enter the desired text . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder : &quot;
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . default sel@@ ects the speakers that will display in the list on cardboard card speakers than the top entry .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . is set for a certain event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action is set for all other events of the particular application . as the final possibility comes the action to stret@@ chers that has been set under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the button save to save the settings for noti@@ fications into a file . use the button loading , to delete stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for voice @-@ over@@ s . this standard contains brands for controlling the voice , the speaker speed , the sex , of the voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3C standard . &quot;
&quot; currently , SS@@ ML supports only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available : &quot;
&quot; you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) because this is the default voice , the festival uses the SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or ton@@ ing in the festival configuration is not on 100@@ ml ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ coding = &quot; 1.0 &quot; - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; http : / / w@@ 3.@@ org / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR @-@ Spe@@ ech / Syn@@ thesis . who has slept in my bed ? asked the Bär@@ en@@ child . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and typ@@ ing bor@@ der@@ filters ( SD@@ S @-@ filter ) . SB@@ Ds sub@@ divide text in individual propositions . this can also start the first phrase , not the whole text order , not the whole text yield . this allows you to also stop or stop or stop and ab@@ ort , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support it directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops are automatically set up . you can change its settings or add another set @-@ ins filter , beginn@@ er will not get off . &quot;
&quot; at the simpl@@ est , you will learn the interior of the appointments by exercising . turn the appointments again , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed , and of course , you need to have more than one speakers , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ op@@ ts ; then you can start with the pre @-@ reading , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you will then be able to stop or break orders on cart@@ on card orders , even if the language syn@@ thesizer this function does not support . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional recognizable filter is automatically set up if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ s for the first time . he can not be switched off , just removed . change nothing about this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ posi@@ tional dys@@ functions compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a table sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional signs ( dec@@ im@@ al characters are removed from the fil@@ tering automatically from the text ) . note that the default pro@@ posi@@ tional controls are removed from the fonts .
&quot; S@@ BD filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( cold ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen real@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from Ver@@ see the normal proposition filter filter , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
on the map menu item you can write the appointments for the application . the box card is shown if
usage of the standard @-@ speaking ( the top on the cardboard card ) . in other words : there are no microphone properties .
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker , which shows all the properties of a standard speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , the most commonly asked properties . &quot;
&quot; select the method for entering the desired microphone , by clicking on one of the buttons . &quot;
&quot; select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do nothing . &quot;
&quot; mark this score , if the property should have priority prior to other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here . &quot;
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will often specify this feature , if you possibly know that a particular application text is sent in a different language other than the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field of speakers , the most con@@ currently corresponds to clear , click on the drop @-@ button speaker , then use the speakers , the most con@@ spic@@ uous . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 for the last text yield in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the entry 0 required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes immediately when it started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get back tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is cr@@ ashed and &amp; kt@@ op@@ ts ; however , you must register G@@ ST regi@@ sters . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ stre@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install g@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio @-@ edition about AL@@ SA does not work when I stop playing music at the same time . if I stop a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ op@@ ts ; a message appears , that is said : &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem exists that conflicts in AL@@ SA will occur that can prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA @-@ Project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ project@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I loaded it for an additional voice for the festival on the Internet . I have installed it and can use them in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int / , the new voice . as guidance can give you the other entries . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the map audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program needs to be installed so@@ x and via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zers such as festival Interactive provide an adjustment for speed . depending on the chosen voice it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the intercom speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML , has its own tags , with which the speed is controlled ; ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML format filter , and set the inter@@ phone speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have a female festival speakers , but &amp; kt@@ op@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 , the day SA@@ B@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so , the X@@ SL file casts to converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a &quot; &quot; ket@@ eer filter filter &quot; &quot; and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ on ; no longer printed orders - or go back . on the Kart@@ ei@@ ving process , the order is placed just out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; water@@ marking ( point , question mark , pun@@ ctu@@ ation , coma and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter . use for these signs instead a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is already installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ project@@ .org )

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflict in the audio edition . if your system also includes music , you can not simultaneously play music and make a text reading . &amp; kt@@ ops , free@@ zes one if you find a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ on , the current set will still be read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of inter@@ phone speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory . de@@ bian users can install so@@ x using the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded &amp; kt@@ op@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with t@@ ar packed archive ) , sign up as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change in this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;

the following modules for lingu@@ istic syn@@ thesi@@ zers are created by default . some of them possess a run @-@ time dependence of non @-@ free software .

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer properly works . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is revealed . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices you can set volume , intercom speed and clay . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . help in the instructions , which are supplied with festival . if you want to read websites , you must install the ( Male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German votes are subject to restrictions on disclosure . &quot;
this voice sets Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage stage . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / . / Russian / . if you enter the Russian votes you need to enter the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ lli@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit@@ - ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions you are looking for the first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 option . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be adjusted to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ rill@@ ally like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over the l@@ ex@@ ical analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; this makes the audio edition . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ votes can be downloaded from

&quot; best use one command , which writes the voice output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio module . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to set the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings for a uniform , integrated user interface . it can be called by selecting K Menu c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
&quot; after the installation , a new module is set in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ; &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers have already been functioning and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and the setting of network properties allows . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed at the installation of &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed . network devices will be added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files , according to the core version , loaded : &quot;
the module settings will be loaded if the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index is selected . when starting the module settings is tried to detect the platform using the system automatically .
&quot; if the platform can not be recognized , the hanging selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and releas@@ ers are best suited . by selecting the adjustment not @-@ re @-@ queries the setting can be made permanently . next start of network settings , this selection will be automatically set . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed , which means changing settings is not possible . in system administration mode , you can enter the system administration system at the right bottom of the module . it is the entry of the password required . &quot;
in the system administration system the entire functionality of the module is available . this one is divided into three Reiter :
the rider net@@ work@@ stations serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown . from the rider interfaces you can perform the following tasks :
the settings of the current network interfaces may be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface ... in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced Settings displays the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Autom@@ atic , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , the TCP / IP configuration is required for each system performance , therefore , no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
with the choice of manu@@ als can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address you need to set the desired TCP / IP address .
&quot; this option is marked , initi@@ alizes the system the network interface in the boats . if the initi@@ alization does not wish , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values given in this dialog will appear as properties of the device in the tool@@ box .
it should be ensured that IP address in the network is not already used . when entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; kon@@ sole ; you can notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . switch from an off network system by selecting the list and click on the interface ....
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need , and activ@@ ating an active network system by selecting the list and click on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; lists the IP address of the network in local sub@@ net , which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if on the computer there is more than one network interface , the interface to the net is to be selected in which the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
a machine with DNS support is replaced by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine calls for IP addresses . if the machine calls on this name to an IP address like 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine to nam@@ ing part of the equ@@ ator nam@@ ing allows easy management of this list . entries can be added either removed or altered wer@@ den@@ .@@ DNS items can be arranged by selecting an arrangement and execution or dem@@ otion in the list with the buttons and may be arranged under the priority .
by clicking the button Add to add ... out of the group calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ator a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog by Die Neue Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver .
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button &quot; Add to Add &quot; button . the entry is inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group of calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ing , select an entry and then click the button editing .... &quot; &quot; the dialog is now displayed . &quot;
&quot; the list of known computers describes b@@ anners on IP @-@ IP address for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by boats , if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of currently known computers includes some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses still support . this still in the test @-@ being version of IP should replace version 4 in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP @-@ address of the known calcul@@ ator and click Add to add ... The dialog New alias is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of known calcul@@ ator and click the &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several Ali@@ as names , de Kno@@ pf Add several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a particular supplier from the list and select editing .... The dialogue of acquain@@ t@@ ances will be displayed .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then by clicking on OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net - from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s just the rpm to download and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graph@@ ically interface such as cold or installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development plan is required with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology will be given , in the second part of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change@@ able configur@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; this section can not replace more knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on integrating the PC into a small ( home - ) network is convey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; IP @-@ networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) is operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never expected large spread . by IP@@ v@@ 6 , this description will therefore focus on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is aware of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator which applies a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP may not be chosen as easy as possible ! &quot;
&quot; when using a own little ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP addres@@ see with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded in the Internet , so their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet can be made for such machines by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks are usually used addresses in the range from 192.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 192.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large for networks to 250 computers big enough .
&quot; in addition , the power @-@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are participants in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first one is the so @-@ called standard route , the constraints the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP transmission . &quot;
the network @-@ address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP @-@ traffic in the local own machine . normally the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works as a closed circle .
&quot; in this part , the configuration files are stored by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes modified with DSL connection , so it will not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections to find another content . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , is known that this file is controlled by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand is expected to happen . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat : is a backup program for Band@@ ings on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape , which over@@ looks out the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ t@@ ar for quick , sel@@ ective extracts . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take , when one ensures ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done on three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; imperial ; sp@@ ult the band back and reads the pres@@ ch@@ illed information of the belt . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the for@@ ks on the tape do not , you will be asked if the tape is to be form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pur@@ ging , searches for the right index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index will be newly created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the belt works , to indicate that the band was integrated . in the stat@@ us@@ bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be sear@@ ched through out of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; prior to throwing the ban@@ ker , first of all the integration must be solved . there are three ways to achieve this . &quot;
&amp; none ; there is a change of symbol for the band to realize that the inclusion of this band has been solved and shows a message in the stat@@ us@@ bar . the band can now be rejected without any danger .
before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be form@@ ated by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ att@@ ed .
&quot; a band @-@ types need to be form@@ att@@ ed before you can use for the saving of data . this procedure does not match the form@@ atting when using the use , this procedure must be done before you use the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ att@@ ed a form@@ atting of the belt ahead , DAT drives , however not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ ward ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all data on the tape go lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting process , the band will be automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you must select the files you can choose . that can be done on three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is stored only this file or the folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . it will only be backed up in the specified profile .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
right click on the local file tree and select in the menu ...
&quot; once the backup was initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can re @-@ examine the selected files and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will be secure . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
highlight a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or the folder are checked .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu item ...
&quot; once the audit process has been started , the dialog settings for testing . in this dialog you can check once again check your selection and change the work folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialogue will be examined . this dialog shows the progress of the verification process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can re @-@ establish the re @-@ establish , the files that should be restored should be marked . this can be done on two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives which belong to the entry for the strap network . it is restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder .
highlight the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folder are restored .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu re @-@ manufacture ....
&quot; once the recovery process was started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog you can check once again check your selection and change the work folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog will be re@@ produced . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the Band@@ index@@ file according to the band@@ content . this process , delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band : &quot;
here is a backup profile with the currently marked files and the default settings . you can use the following settings for a backup profile :
&quot; the current work folder , where the backup should be made . the list of clear files will be updated automatically according to the currently selected work folder . &quot;
&quot; for all the folder , which are listed under backup files , that only those files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folder , which are stored on other file systems , you can insert separately below backup files . each entry is considered by t@@ ar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; carry out an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files are changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be used . only the files are guaranteed that have since changed since then . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used for determining the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup . &quot;
&quot; delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes all files , and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is laid out . &quot;
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of preparation of this documentation .
the settings allows you to set up over the menu item KD@@ at ... in the Settings Settings . the following settings allows you to make :
the full path to the device system for the Band@@ disk ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ petition variant of the band@@ unit .
&quot; this attitude is active , transmitted &amp; none ; before the band is integrated , the command mt load on the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be carried out . &quot;
&quot; is the option turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the boom in the belt plant . possibly this setting does not work with all strap works . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , when solving the integration of &amp; none , the band is k@@ ick@@ ed . do not use this option at Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ core block size for the band@@ width is to change . no matter if this attitude is active or not , you must communicate , in any case the block@@ size for your strap works . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ dat ; a band formed , it writes a file at the beginning of the ban@@ ker . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( N Byte ) The Band @-@ ID . the format of this text is : seconds , where calcul@@ ator is the complete name of the system in which the band has been form@@ att@@ ed . seconds has passed the number of seconds , which has been form@@ att@@ ed since the epoch in which the band has been form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file named in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar -@@ archives which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar manage . even other t@@ ar -@@ versions should function as long as it does not include incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup ban@@ ker . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows the various protocol files . furthermore , easy access to information about problems which occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; a system@@ log ; helps users understand what your machine is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified user interface , which is not aware of where you can obtain information about your system or where the system checks the various protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users with quick access to information about problems which can occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions , with whose help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a range of useful features . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screens@@ hot , presents &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features available , with which the individual protocol lines can be easily fil@@ tering and sort . the individual possibilities for sor@@ ting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first of all , the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol window , so you have not indicated it , and it opens up for Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually not own permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar , to filter according to a selected crit@@ erion or according to a given string . the list of the log lines is now automatically modified , so that only a protocol lines will only appear , if in one of the columns the string of the filter is included . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . select the fil@@ tering process , then select the column process , and enter into the fil@@ tering system the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines which have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are shown with a striking color as protocol lines of the level hint . the colored display of protocol @-@ lines can be switched on .
&quot; for example , you would like to show certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this may be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you will use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new add @-@ up protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage . once you have selected a window , select a log on to the display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ ar@@ e.@@ org. D@@ ort you will find more information on the supply sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you will also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it quickly developed to the standard for control of the program starting the system in the &amp; Linux ; and that &apos;s why it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it @-@ binary @-@ file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V in@@ it , without a rein@@ stall and re @-@ format . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was there . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from BSD in@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder from / etc . , this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start using the system or change to another Run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ ters , which only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; the r@@ c.@@ local should be part of / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems own this file , even if you do not want a lot of use for it . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ &quot; in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry something to do with the seri@@ als . &quot;
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that he finds .
the standard Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably discover that the pre @-@ mentioned Run@@ level 3 is . if you have to change it , then you can fix something by starting the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it now start all the right scripts ? if you ls the l &apos;@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how does and stopping in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written , that it is an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line below : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K involves , the script is called on the argument . if he includes an S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set yourself a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I might have &amp; eg ; a server -@@ Run@@ level , that can only be htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; , Network &amp; etc ; start . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ inters is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of the Avail@@ able system services to one of the six run@@ level to start him at this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also move the balance between Run@@ lev@@ les , or change the position within a level by changing it elsewhere . this will only happen if they draw an entry from the area of the Avail@@ able system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you prefer to copy them into a new area . to select it only on a new Run@@ level , you need to select explicitly from the menu item or from the context menu , and in the target range -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of a single application can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sor@@ ting of the surrounding items before you can try again to include the system service . &quot;
&quot; please note : currently , there is no possibility to restore entries into the tr@@ ash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work@@ places ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 stop , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the c@@ ursor buttons to make a selection of top or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to post@@ p@@ one entry into another Run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X use ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a entry manually , press the entry button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by using the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before it will be executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if they are available . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ les , and now the machine starts up @-@ up again . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab , and modify the default Run@@ level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) . &quot;
&quot; I have made some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE , or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distri@@ butions available . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the type , such as system services started in these distri@@ butions , is simplified the configuration for the proprietary tool programs of this distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an expansion of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use any other distribution : please check if any configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) will not end up if its configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; user user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user user . &quot;
&quot; after you have made modifications , you must save it . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry save in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two boxes cards , the user interface and user group list . for editing the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ clicking on the entry . it appears the dialog user interface and group properties . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only shown , if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space card ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a card card will appear , if shadow can be installed or , for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; map password will be released , in case of shadow passwords , or / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ ces . &quot;
this card card appears only if for at least a statisti@@ c file system extingu@@ ishing ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable on the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ es@@ ystem ) . here you can be modified for each user parameters in each case :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system will be selected using space @-@ restricted with the help of the field system .
&quot; map groups inform@@ s about the group members of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the field prime group . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by clicking it in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to a group , just highlight this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add out of the menu user or group or click the matching Add button . the item or delete the selected user or the selected group does not function . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO @-@ boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and remove the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems . &quot;
