<seg id="414">The vivid filter siates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. he differs from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for an on daylight-optimised colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color during daylight and high contrasts."</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter sisimulated neonlight to the contrasters. the parameters levels controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeating the strength of the Neonlight. with great pictures the filter can be the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the colour contrasting and the luminosity of the photos. you can look at the various farms and the luminosity of the photos. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation is a good choice to reduce the saturation instead of increasing her. all changes you can perform in preview. if Him do the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool Gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / gamma, the tool is perfectly readable to improve the exposure. even if dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of slider. concrete the three slide below the histograms."</seg>

<seg id="481">Unsharfe-mask works at the contrast of the edges to leave a picture sharply. indeed it's not working as psychovisual Dunes. you can use it to make atmospheric Dunes and it is here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"revising is possibly the best of the three, since he really improved the sharpness. he is a little more complicated in its use and has several parameters for adaptation."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of sharpness. this is because of the digitalization process colors with only minimal differences. this in turn leads to a common colour. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points will be printed on paper. SLR cameras will normally need more thoughtfully sharply as normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG pictures, a camera is used to apply internal sharply. pictures in the raw format, however, must always be sharpened during the processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner now turn a sharpness, already during the readable of the picture. if you disable these disabling, you will get control of your image."</seg>

<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crackly. the solution, the image is a little soft to record, is much easier than it sharpened. use the tool for softening with the menu entry and experiment something with settings. the presumpster on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blur maskieren is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help you edit the picture. the presumpster shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values create very good results and should first try out. an increase in the radius or the amount enhance the effect. if you create the unsharpening mask, the noise and the impression of Grates in the vicinity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius poses one of how many pixels are affected by the filter by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radiators. they should therefore sharpens pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image one of the original is added. this makes the strength of the sharpness.</seg>

<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular Faltung is working much better than the Gauß's Faltung. the Gauß's Faltung has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the original pixel which depends far from the original pixel. the flaw of the Gauß'ean Faltung is most often influenced by the remote pixel. this causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular Faltung. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images the default value is worth 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred but then on Heiligenvouchers.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: a increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 b & eg; 0.95 and mum. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filter: a increase in smoking filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1% rarely. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a high value is 0.03. a high value will still consume the image further."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your insharpness Gauß is. in most cases, you should use this value to zero to avoid sharpenalized artefacts. if you raise a value unequal to zero, you might also have to raise the correlation and / oderhfilter filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"mattress size: this value determines the size of the transformational atrix. an increase in mattress size can generate good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow if you select great values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>

<seg id="505">"try all audiences, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you modify the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later left unpleasant artefacts."</seg>

<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels which have a gap of 1 from Pixelblock will be drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default language method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less for Pixelblock will be drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is used to interpoll the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Kubo: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are deducted to calculate a bi-cubator surface (2-dim), or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim), which is used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block."</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for Synthesizer, which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-map general-MIDI events occur in events that understands the synthesizer."</seg>

<seg id="1661">In this section the patches provided by General MIDI on your specific keyboard. the general usage looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equals will be ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order for one of 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds, which this instrument is to put on the tone with the number M (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to gun powder. this allows you to enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"if so now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (Win), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here is meant with the word drum patch of the patch, in which each tone represents another percussioninstrument (Drum, Basas & etc;) and not the one who means the sound-height of the always same drum (as they own some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">KEYMAP section is used to specify how tints are shown on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as in the PATCHMAP section the order of the lines is very important, as well as their availability. so you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can use multiple Keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you just need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form sounds on the Perkeling channel. look at the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to cut some channels to others. if you want to switch to the first and second channel, you can easily do it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (general MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section which has 16 lines, numbered between 0 and 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"N is thereby the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap is necessary to use the name name for this channel. if you want to change the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case there is always Patch x."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the Perkicks patch on the Perkur channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates that the ratio of Pitch-Bender-Event sends out with the value, this is calculated with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file (no decimalkommas are)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is used because GM presupposes to play a keyboard, which is a Pitch-Bender event, with the value 4096 to play a note higher. unfortunately, try some keyboards higher up to a octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, just open the dialogue MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole range of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboard you see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. if you have changed a tool, the button no longer green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1681">"the pace-LCD shows the speed, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. if you find e.g. finding a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc;. with this, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, just like two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while an mp3-file will need a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; have been compiled, because & kmid; no Awe support have to compile and install the problem (for example from kmid; 's Home)"</seg>

<seg id="2968">"how does and stopping init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written, that it is an argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line below:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K involves, the script is called on the argument. if he includes an S, the script is called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set yourself a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I might have & eg; a server -Runlevel, that can only be httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc;, Network & etc; start."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointers is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of the Available system services to one of the six runlevel to start him at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move the balance between Runlevles, or change the position within a level by changing it elsewhere. this will only happen if they draw an entry from the area of the Available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you prefer to copy them into a new area. to select it only on a new Runlevel, you need to select explicitly from the menu item or from the context menu, and in the target range -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a single application can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting of the surrounding items before you can try again to include the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"please note: currently, there is no possibility to restore entries into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to enable the different workplaces (Available system services, Runlevel 1 stop, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection of top or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to postpone entry into another Runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X use) and add it to the desired Runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually, press the entry button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by using the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before it will be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if they are available. otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; restored. changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard Runlevles, and now the machine starts up-up again. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab, and modify the default Runlevel at a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have made some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they will not be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE, or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distributions available. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the type, such as system services started in these distributions, is simplified the configuration for the proprietary tool programs of this distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an expansion of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use any other distribution: please check if any configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) will not end up if its configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel, so that this manual can be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & user user; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & user user."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made modifications, you must save it. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the entry save in the menu file."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two boxes cards, the user interface and user group list. for editing the desired user or the desired group with a double-clicking on the entry. it appears the dialog user interface and group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some card cards are only shown, if you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space card (Quota) for users, a card card will appear, if shadow can be installed or, for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD-Unices."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"map password will be released, in case of shadow passwords, or / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD -Unices."</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if for at least a statistic file system extinguishing (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable on the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can be modified for each user parameters in each case:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system will be selected using space-restricted with the help of the field system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"map groups informs about the group members of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, you will find in the field prime group. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by clicking it in the large field."</seg>
