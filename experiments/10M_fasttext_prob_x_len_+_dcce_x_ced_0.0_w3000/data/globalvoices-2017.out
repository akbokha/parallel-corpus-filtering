&quot; although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extremely great .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors have been read and operated by American authors . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gr@@ ay Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible re@@ por@@ ous conspir@@ acy of a oil magn@@ ates , who were covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as the Jura @-@ Stu@@ d , which were the most su@@ preme Bundes@@ court with judges , who were interested to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was as if that is absolute truth , it is anything that I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting , that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very black@@ ish love letter about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me how he goes with his bott@@ len@@ eck .
he never stops with his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague expressed it , and declared publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people react to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won at the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number that ever reached by the party nom@@ ination candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans , who support these big@@ otto person , I asked me ? &quot;
I was able to get Tru@@ mp and his voters don &apos;t get into line with people during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalist , the director of journ@@ alism programme , the people from all over the world , a deep unbeliev@@ ing person , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the Tru@@ mp@@ s world@@ view did not agree with the Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Int@@ oler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr that fights their lives long , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she also fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped with a lot of patience and grace , and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then , there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values they em@@ bo@@ died through them in deep my love of America .
&quot; during the Tru@@ mp of his way to the nom@@ ination Republi@@ can presidential data , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part of his restricted vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the argument with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they had either their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ looked these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as r@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange the people , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and respectful and indicates an in@@ capacity to understand those who act in another way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities will not be taken into account .
could it be that these voters have voted for Tru@@ mp because they would like to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed it ?
&quot; in other words , they might perhaps say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m. ) . : so much like &quot; &quot; el@@ ong@@ ation of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word game of white in stri@@ ving to the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ cl@@ ash , which means as much as sl@@ eu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the big Van Jones , that has done exactly what America did so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country is elected as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise , saying : to Hell with versatility , religious freedom and the entire concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the ruin , say they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton had Mr. Khan had a wor@@ ding with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; brood the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos , have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; rep@@ lied , &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ri@@ ef@@ en her and her voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; if someone who does not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a vote and &quot; strong &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s land , told the message . &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
&quot; that the music , played in both places , not only the life of children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 . an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and world famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) in the community : one of the children and adults existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found an opportunity to overcome poverty in their music instruments . &quot;
a music @-@ school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexi@@ kos , is known for its Dru@@ gs abuse and the gangs violence . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hop@@ eless person . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come l@@ ach@@ ingly and play with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , flute , wild@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , B@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; over 7.@@ 000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which is practically located on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments that are made of re @-@ plated waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments , made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for music instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the Rec@@ ycl@@ er under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez have started to turn parts of the waste in instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ it@@ ating viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , guit@@ ars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion , all made of the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local econom@@ ist and Musi@@ cians &apos; teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , to the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed as F@@ avi@@ o , which he had never seen before : one made of waste from waste . &quot;
today there is a whole orchestra which plays from recur@@ rent material on instruments and called The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance at :
the world produces approximately one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish .
&quot; those who live with him and live by him are the poorest , as people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational spectacle from rub@@ b@@ ish music around the world .
the orchestra has played his music even before Pope Francis :
&quot; these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can be successfully fought against illegal fishing , &quot;
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fought against illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that is targeted on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re @-@ release is done within an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was then known that this ship was already operated in liber@@ ated waters of illegal fishing , before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were therefore raised and little incl@@ ined , welcome a Legisl@@ ation of this kind at its shores . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised himself swi@@ f@@ tly against the ship . they refuse to place one of their har@@ bours , and refuse to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ sudden was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply deny everything &quot; , &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leit@@ ner of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ man . he is part of a team that discovered and followed by ship . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch them down there .
&quot; ultimately , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liber@@ ia , due to lo@@ oting the fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO Stop Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing ( Ill@@ egal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; besides Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that the Prime Minister had been exp@@ elled from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is captured is hidden because of it is extremely difficult to rech@@ arge . there@@ with is the illegal fishing is a leading cause of the over@@ fishing of regions .
&quot; by inten@@ tional cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can hurt that a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; however , while actions against illegal fishing once were hin@@ dered by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ dles and also through the sn@@ ail , the actions occur today in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platforms . &quot;
&quot; there the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists , news , di@@ gest@@ ed activities or details that can be noticed during a port @-@ spec@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move along the open lake , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to character@@ ize the authorities , ships that fish in wast@@ ed areas . also , so suspic@@ ious way to discover that a ship invites its prisoners on other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations may show whether the ships involved have a fishing license where they were on the way and perhaps even if they have a criminal register . &quot;
&quot; countries which are against illegal fishing , can refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . and that they might not be forced to sell their cargo . and that they might be forced to pay for numbers , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing activity will not pay more financially . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , director director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the aforementioned platform was created to win estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which lose eight members of the network at H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to the illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive @-@ fish species , present for the region of commercial fishing , from all over the world . among these even those illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; these actions include actions such as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ feit licensing , indication of ph@@ antasi@@ es , the fish protected species and the fish in nature conservation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ consistent control system . &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could not go illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; you do not walk my port . &quot;
but another country could say &quot; Kom@@ m to me &quot; . &quot; and precisely this legal s@@ laughter was trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations . &quot;
&quot; it has revealed criminal networks , the f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships who used several fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ic identi@@ ties and it has been tr@@ acked ships and found . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us fairly far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i , di@@ gest@@ ed ships precise . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed further , also helps to rech@@ arge the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an NGO , which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships will turn off their automatic in@@ denti@@ fication systems , which they can no longer be used by satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different information levels with each other . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations do indeed influence the un@@ question@@ able global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently Sky@@ team has recently opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch with Google and the maritime organization Oc@@ e@@ ana , a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed through the position of every single trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; join forces with neighbours to get a better picture of who what is doing - that is simply sense , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to combine themselves and to bund@@ le their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , where a global system allows persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only crimin@@ als , but also sc@@ esses . &quot;
&quot; ships that used earlier without a license and can hardly be reck@@ oned with consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries meanwhile have a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since then fishing boats more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after the ISH @-@ i Somalia had assisted Gre@@ ko 1 , Gre@@ ko 1 found the insp@@ ectors there on board the hau@@ ling network whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strongly that we can now copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study objective over several hundred million dollars through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries joined together , so called West Africa Task Force . also , they are fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with safety , the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s younger member countries began to report on his first big triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the wrong flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used pre@@ fers used by now . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated in bot@@ any waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set out a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a particular , collaborative effort to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world sea .

&quot; your articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , New York Times and The Guardian . location in Venezuela is continuing to further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of capture the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fier@@ ce demonstrations .
&quot; they are regarded as a protest against the decision of the government , the referendum on behalf of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot;

&quot; under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the back@@ order of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them . &quot;
the debate is also managed in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat land Bar@@ inas and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central Region of Mé@@ rida and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , which makes itself noticeable in everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by a acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition looked at the Am@@ t@@ sen@@ th@@ hooting of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change ; ultimately , however , the subscription of re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , fellow musicians at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sums up in their newest article in the context of the governance process : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate and certain@@ ties to the highest all over the world belong ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual degree ) and in which a serious and wide @-@ level lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered to be the only way to reg@@ ain his institutional structures and make a new government alliance . &quot;

&quot; particularly large waves , the message suggested by poli@@ cing oppression in the central city of Marac@@ ay . &quot;
the prot@@ esters got back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advocates of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral safely but the protests continued .
&quot; in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ gue T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira bear no tube , because otherwise you could see something that many nation @-@ Germans did not have anything ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic has already power the amount of repression per day : &quot;
&quot; thus , the dictatorship has suppres@@ sed the country . &quot;
many representatives of the government had proven the validity of the demand for an office procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many through the presence of countless people on the street .

&quot; this is an adapted version of a interviews by Al@@ ejo Gó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on August 23 , 2016 to d@@ ía a d@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine dessert . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as of now an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the frame of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of Córdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting at the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal lac@@ kl@@ ash per@@ ished in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
&quot; 34 years , he retained the family san@@ itation for himself . &quot;
in the situation back then I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , you do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer , and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ ebe@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was the secret of the intelligence of 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , which was charged for kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who spoke against his own Father against his own Father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows that great powers has one parent , and how this child chose a way of rede@@ mption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take part in the military base , I often went with us to the sports hall . there I had made friends with a boy , the martial arts . &quot;
&quot; all known him &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
&quot; you are a Ar@@ d@@ loch , you have made you friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
pass on that they will not dec@@ eive you one day and I then have to save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo ( revolution@@ aries ) - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers &apos; party in Argentina .
&quot; therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would be obe@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought , that would be ok . for so , my Father had put me out . &quot;
on the military base I had to dismis@@ sed papers that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , Prop@@ ag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da dr@@ practice the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
&quot; my father took me a total of four@@ teen times , after La Per@@ la , and all in 1976 . &quot;
during the first and last time he did not let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he took me to desc@@ end . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
all of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little wrapped in a ceiling , and command@@ ed to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were ab@@ duc@@ ted and talked with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I sp@@ lash out , and saw a goat , on the human being tor@@ tured . &quot;
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
&quot; later , I found out that it was fixed at the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just down there . &quot;
&quot; they rarely bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , ski@@ pped him with water and j@@ acked a charge of 220 Volt into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the frame was dr@@ unk there ... like a dirty win@@ dle .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in distress .
I could never forget that smell .
&quot; and I asked me , How is it possible to do such a lot of suffering from another so much ? &quot;
&quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and were buried with eye . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mat@@ tresses on which naked people were captiv@@ ated with the face - all were captiv@@ ated in hands and feet .
close to the entrance ch@@ ant people still to the mat@@ tresses .
&quot; when my father noted that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ st you so , Ar@@ d@@ loch ? &quot;
&quot; I missed &quot; &quot; Why did you get rid of me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and was killed by soldiers .
&quot; I know that , because my father was at home of it . &quot;
&quot; besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero also struck a man in a man and sol@@ dered .
&quot; ( according to the survi@@ vor@@ s of the civil , Jorge Rom@@ ero , which was also charged at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial , the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the leader of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former Fol@@ der chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came here , is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look on the map , see that they took about this route and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names have been changed and they were assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ised a number .
&quot; if they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the top came from above that they should be published . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the sho@@ ots of men and the dis@@ appearance of its cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ ring &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things up home .
at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ nings &quot; - as they knew - was .
&quot; but when I was later working on the military - I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war was a B@@ aj@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs which one has fought one enemy , which one fought one . &quot;

&quot; but when you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ r , then that is not a war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply do not understand it .
I was also officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a crimin@@ als , and I rep@@ lied , and thou that thou sti@@ r on the street on the street ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and crying : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you curious . &quot;
for this we need no one another !
this was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from that time , on which I had a jack@@ et and a roller swe@@ ater made of w@@ ool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence , a co @-@ disappeared at this crime . I dis@@ ed , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
&quot; anyway , I was there to testi@@ fy . &quot;
&apos;@@ the tight@@ ening of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find Reu@@ ben . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have therefore ex@@ udes during the dictatorship of people . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apped ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with her home , his mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have simply put them into jail .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people . but what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not even families to whom you could pass their mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the tight@@ ening of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act to do a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they took machinery to eliminate the imm@@ or@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were cr@@ ashed and somewhere ent@@ ated - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains always .
I have seen how you killed men ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my Father .
&quot; the thought of view my father was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him alleg@@ ations because of all of the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have no one killed . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked me to what the whole @-@ level patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they were supposedly defended , actually good . &quot;
then I cri@@ ed :
how can you tell us what to tell ?
I have seen how you killed men !
you have committed aw@@ ful crimes and you were forced to participate as a child to participate .
&quot; he was disgu@@ ised only &quot; &quot; Well in me &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
2010 F@@ unds the first ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had finally recognized that he was a criminal . &quot;
&quot; nobody can throw me , that I have been pre@@ ached . I finally said against my own Father . &quot;

the jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the document . &quot;
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a trial opened committed to crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August 1978 . &quot;
43 suppres@@ ses were found guilty for crimes against humanity . the court beg@@ ged in 28 cases of life @-@ long det@@ ention and in nine cases arrest warran@@ t between 2 and 14 years . in six cases it was fre@@ ed .

Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he set the following words to the ear@@ ing chamber :

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error in a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend his leadership . &quot;
the photo was spread in social media .
elabor@@ ation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers became a newly opened centre in which you can extend its leader , in the last month witnesses of a very particularly mis@@ fortune translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield , the Japanese word ( Cor@@ si@@ bel@@ lo@@ sha ) , the &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; means that the &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; means &quot; fal@@ si@@ bly - but maybe also with vi@@ cious ling@@ shot &amp; # 8@@ 212 . &quot;
it was the wrong translation from 1 to 20 September in electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often published in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os , he was also who made aware of the local time @-@ time . &quot;
the British newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to the elderly and in an international city as Kyoto just unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; dart drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , if also gram@@ mati@@ cally are not completely correct designation &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto exc@@ ap@@ olog@@ ised for the translation error . furthermore , they explained that the bug had already been included in the text and that the translation has not been checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blog@@ ger reported how follows the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincere that older people felt by insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online news source J @-@ Cast News made a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; was set as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police are the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents , but quite cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; Kyoto &apos;s pre@@ fecture , for example , were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of seniors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , seniors in 18@@ 03 caused by a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , their share rose to 17,@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has declined , the proportion of seniors in the same period has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the named Repor@@ ter brought in the published version of the article &apos;s comments to light , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently appear largely against elderly drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors received the following comments :
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; It is missing , the translation is actually not at all , or ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are no such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real f@@ gru@@ ity for this bizarre error in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to over@@ use two important features : passive knowledge , to understand the initial text and to transfer active language skills to address it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case in native language . in general , the conviction that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the native language - native language . &quot;
so a French native language should translate from English to French - not from French to English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on .
&quot; many Japanese businesses do not employ a staff with English as native language , the translations into English . this may result in faul@@ ty understanding of the super@@ visory , costs , or the relatively small number of English native speakers , which may be Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies who do not have foreign employees , allow translation nonetheless fir@@ ing internally . then the Japanese employees , whose English knowledge is done to be the best , made to transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ ted and en@@ ig@@ ous movements created by machine translation , show that this technique can not replace a long way of human transl@@ ators . this applies to some languages quite well . &quot;
&quot; some of the most rare English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious en@@ dow@@ sing , which often uses T @-@ shirts or bags , are not used for styl@@ istic reasons - not read or even understood . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may prove as jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless . but by large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the Kyoto continues to use a serious source for its translation in the future .
Venezuela : protest protests and ens@@ ored actions on the internet and television
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7th , mel@@ ted ven@@ e@@ an internet users , that they would have no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet pres@@ ences of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV will no longer be accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online stations over@@ hau@@ led recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ists who resist@@ ed the government of Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court opened the Parliament and transferred to the Parliament &apos;s duties on the executive and the upper court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is bound to use VP@@ N ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VP@@ N .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ ol@@ ate providers have been locked once again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , traditional media has been reported in the reporting of protests . at that time the Commission was reported for telecommunications and closing arguments if they continue to report on demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without co@@ d TV and informative national television channels I have signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two lit@@ res of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible but also two other online channels . this also concerns the Internet site , on which the National Assembly transm@@ its its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous post @-@ research inquiries made by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that local Internet providers might use DNS service . this is a technique , due to the DNS server requests in certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server is faul@@ ty or denied the request for the call of such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS sper@@ re : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third sear@@ ched channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , the 6th of April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who survived the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten , while he was founded in police . &quot;
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to show . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the Government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this allows the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls will go to slavery in order to receive a training &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was a child a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witness to other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shorten@@ ed version of a report written by cur@@ ated , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series called &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Flying Co@@ ws , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , which are edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived for eight years in a household , where they did not work together with the family who was there to eat . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her university degree at the university she returned to the house again and heard , as the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that , from which has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she became ten years old , she began to work as cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas one described in Paraguay the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money , gives her inf@@ eri@@ ous son or her inf@@ eri@@ or daughter to another , rich family . in exchange the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that children must pay for countless days of home@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be up@@ lift . &quot;
this as a Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice is common in Paraguay due to the involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ enga worked for a few years in an organization responsible for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas , especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - sam@@ pled witness , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things to name the name , because the sense of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who wish her daughter in the faith that they complete their training to improve their position in society and make something out of itself , to a different family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family stands up with their faith and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the faith that they would give somebody a chance who would otherwise have no training and maybe even star@@ ve . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mis@@ ed , his family will experience only many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , this has been relatively un@@ familiar phenomenon that is taking place in the secret of par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came to hospital , her body showed traces of fier@@ ce blo@@ ws . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former Mil@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ejo who works as an official at the population of the population .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants of 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra struck with a stick on Mar@@ ín until it suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep practice in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s death for the death of the girl .
they signed the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest to protest and demanded that there is no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay have registered more cows than children , called Tina Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; without paper , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions the boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the married and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded for an independent study of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ejo for the murder of the girl , which was their Cri@@ ad@@ ita , sentenced to 30 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be the case - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot;
the daily life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ itas is not only exploited as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga had ten years of age , as the farms in which her father worked , bank@@ rupt , and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers had to work all work and began to sell on the street or on the market sweets to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as a Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ enga worked for four to six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she got up every morning at 5 pm and prepared breakfast for their employer .
&quot; for example , they puri@@ fies the refrigerator , p@@ ub@@ te the living room , pol@@ ed the furniture and des@@ id the ground . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at an end , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more they had finished with learning , the more free time had it . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga says , she had never had to hungry , but also did not get un@@ bound@@ ed food . &quot; I was allowed to pick me more books from the library of the household than eating out of the refrigerator . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was during the dictatorship of Al@@ fredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; to some dis@@ closing of the hous@@ eholder Al@@ var@@ enga , next to him and to read the article from Op@@ position@@ ings such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade them to give the reports of official media over the regime of the dict@@ ator . &quot;

&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would like to learn there &quot; bad habit , &quot; that Al@@ var@@ enga belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , to be back home back their native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the formation , which they had made , would lose them , explains her . &quot;
&quot; it was totally clear , however , that they had been paid for everything they got from them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga is discrimin@@ ated in school . &quot; one thing , about which almost never is spoken , har@@ ass@@ ment and the chic@@ ks of which Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ ad@@ ita is . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my house . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in time , where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not one group . &quot;
&quot; isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;

&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share bu@@ ckl@@ es for clean@@ ers and n@@ anny in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the Administration in the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city bear@@ er in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .

please mel@@ ted to you .
&quot; beginning on Monday , if possible . &quot;
the display got five &apos; Li@@ kes &apos; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ u@@ by wrote that she had a miserable girl and gave their phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ u@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote her . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inland , which would like to work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then switch@@ gear to the display once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
in the Pro@@ log on report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ H@@ asta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long yet ? ) , a collection of witnesses say former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history we managed to create systems like slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( an office from the Spring@@ time ) , in which the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í had to dismis@@ sed and to their &quot; wives . &quot; therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys are committed to a system of slavery in which they become light victims for abuse and exploitation . &quot;
social inequality in Paraguay and the show of power are known to the understanding of the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
draft law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian MPs have recently voted a bill to &quot; regul@@ ators &quot; regulations regarding the use and utility of social networks .
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , users and users of social media must register in Egypt with a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a job would be established , providing citizens with permission to place social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users may need to register users and users on the site of the site with their proper name and human resources to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; it will fail to do so , this could be a punishment of up to six months in cust@@ ody or a money bu@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; the bill introduced , which consists of six plots and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as a &quot; every application that runs over the internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video clips and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be en@@ forced if the design cannot be imposed on how Egyptian authorities are unable to create users and users who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies .
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ arians and sponsors of the legislative situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password &quot; to come by fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
&quot; this might mean that Egypt is planning to re@@ fine a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians , to be able to access their identity to the network . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not known so far that such plans exist . &quot;
experts and experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research T@@ echnolog@@ ical ( in German &quot; leit@@ ner researcher &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I have double the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt with regard to things , which have to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that same as they can control violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take them seriously , it means that they are set up a strong surveillance system to apply citizens who apply a permit or not . and this means a mad@@ man to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring it to a court process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must be discussed at first by the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure of Parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary session . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the design &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military thought @-@ art in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and assured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy proposed a legislative law@@ suit against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was found guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq work the Ti@@ ersch@@ ütz@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq to protect the spiritual leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards , which goes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leopard ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are always less pre@@ y . &quot;
why is this particular kind of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only subject @-@ remaining pre@@ di@@ ous ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big pre@@ pre@@ y player is present . &quot;
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards actually in the free wild or@@ bit is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video so that they have a shot of a large cat in the camera course , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ olog@@ in , R@@ aza is passionate about another side of their country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 , the newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the past six years to re@@ construct the lives of those who have caused by the &quot; Triple @-@ disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a vast earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima disaster had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , which is located in the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was an advanced pre@@ fecture , in Japan @-@ northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting T@@ sun@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring disciplines Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ate have been evac@@ u@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
&quot; even more , the Pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima had an atomic accident , already alone had to leave their homes for 160 000 inhabitants . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o shows from local point of view which progress made six years after it began to re@@ construct the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authorities as well as pol@@ l results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( b ) , one , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could record Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement parts were finished . &quot;
&quot; Iw@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima with 70 percent is the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , in addition , you can still try six years after the catastrophe , Ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated of Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald ( b ) , one , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts . &quot;
after the triple @-@ disaster there were almost 80 000 people forced to live in homes .
&quot; in December 2016 still 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ate in such containers . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 per cent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima lives still live in emergency accommodation , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evac@@ uation , which were subjected to disaster in containers , were settled in final homes . &quot;
for Iw@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fecture .
&quot; how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ newspaper could establish , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools supported by the un@@ happiness , opened their doors to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of schools of the three pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fecture are much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; during almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iv@@ ori@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i now have been in operation , have only thirty percent of the fisher@@ y mar@@ inas had their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have moved large @-@ scale in the three pre@@ fecture of agricultural land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iv@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that only a consequence of the atomic fact is , because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are located in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ aza zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fecture , tourism has consistently recovered from tourism , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima has left far off . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate are back to 90 percent at the same level as before un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in contrast , only 75 percent can be found here . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reported that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it will feel more difficult to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; to determine a total picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys by the local population and among the evac@@ uation . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and also , as their recep@@ tive against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk has changed . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Newspaper explained :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents who have taken action to be prepared for the future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in terms of disasters @-@ prevention has been done . &quot;
&quot; as for those , who had to evac@@ u@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima &quot;
&quot; in their edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung continued their attention to the location of evac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the enormous earthqu@@ akes and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ ism caused by the Japan ever . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were moved outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were a little more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the date of 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants live from Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; the majority of the evac@@ u@@ ates are most of the evac@@ uation , who still have to return to homes , older than 50 years old . they are competing for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Iw@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is a part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries , who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one recogni@@ zes that one more links than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global compounds are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to bro@@ aden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices of Pod@@ cast , we look carefully these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we cover topics that often get less attention in the coverage than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we talk to five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly linked to someone over voice and national borders . &quot;
&quot; her Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a hike continues its affection for Iranian culture ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he gathered in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into intensive care station : last Friday took him a police be@@ am@@ ter during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nation@@ wide participated millions of prot@@ esters at a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , the Social Sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ shepherd and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors sacrific@@ ed him on this Saturday and have now moved him into an artificial composite .
his condition is considered to be critical .
the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that quickly spread within a few days fast in Brazil .
&quot; on the pictures , the face of the police officers is also identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police were known in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been sus@@ pen@@ ed until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident by the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke to the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; would be a police be@@ am@@ ter of a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care station , his face would be six months long on TV and the whole oppression would be justified . &quot;

&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective is also filmed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip we shown the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans re@@ ais ( approximately 2.@@ 700 Euro ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while staying in the hospital . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás in memory : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish from his father killed , only to crimin@@ alize the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools , and now we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who has struck him with a stroke . &quot;
police sur@@ gri@@ ps
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , which occurred in the past Friday to brutal police assignments against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ emen placed at the protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ ate and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the representative Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speakers to refrain from violence against prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media is dec@@ eived by adding the focus to another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window @-@ window . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a crus@@ hing glass window to make up with a photo their cover @-@ pages illustr@@ ative .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set @-@ up bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window board than the protests of thousands of people , who serve the defense of a special cause . &quot;
&quot; this must also recognise , if one is strictly against any form of atomic damage . &quot;
&quot; again , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is a absurd to dis@@ proportionate , and the typical perpet@@ u@@ ity of the military police are protected by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on Kon@@ front@@ ational foot@@ ing with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the frag@@ ments forgotten by the un@@ indu@@ str@@ ated villages in Cuba
the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso closed almost hundreds of sugar factories throughout Cuba ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar@@ mill - no matter what there is no n@@ enn@@ est sugar @-@ harvest spot . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were l@@ acked in the sugar@@ s .
&quot; after the lying , the sugar industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost gradually and after its installations , until only the ru@@ mor was left of steel and concrete . &quot;
about 272 workers had to be new .
some rarely the work .
other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ es and comm@@ ute to the factories every day .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which stands out every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar@@ s , who are in operation after a long in@@ active period of time because they were received . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene reminds us exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would be received the sugar cane factory , but the promise has not been kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar@@ s has already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the I@@ ne@@ ff@@ izi , the bad governance and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production of 1,6 million tons of sugar was produced less than 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a mot@@ if for a couple of decades to have been a motive for the country , but the poor harv@@ esting are already no doubt . &quot;
why has the Cub@@ an sugar@@ be@@ ers has been switched off ?
the old railway station of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar@@ s industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar fabri@@ cated brands have been technically out@@ dated , and barely competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons . &quot;
they only left the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
&quot; the motives , which resulted in such measures were the low productivity of sugar plant@@ ations and sugar@@ be@@ aters in the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price went over a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os are to stay per pound , according to the 2016 &quot; &quot; agricultural &quot; &quot; of the OECD and the FAO , the Agricultural and Nutri@@ tional Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production of 2001 would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the commodity export would be approx . 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day with safety in history , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro , during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from there the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
&quot; in the following years the stagn@@ ation of a total of 98 sugar factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for continuing education . &quot;
the same happened at the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as it is known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them has been informed that the factory would be tac@@ kled .
&quot; so that the place is preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first leg @-@ year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written documents that would be removed only regarding the parts , which would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the ministers could with@@ stand any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from there , the responsibility of the days and the letters became increasingly frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the nursing factory two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still being in operation of sugar be@@ at@@ ches .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the stagn@@ ation of the factory , in whose construction he was helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removal , dismant@@ led one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial range of Cuba and more important work@@ space has been deleted .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for employment and benefits were generated in the municipalities where they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the dam@@ p president saw in the eyes of the present people as he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation since five years , everything would run well . &quot;

since 2004 sugar cane is only extrac@@ ted by M@@ illing .

&quot; after two years , the Pop@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; closed as the sugar cane factory , or rather said than they began to dis@@ assemble it , they also listened to the road to asp@@ halt , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories had to seek . &quot;
they were to spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people were killed in the region . &quot;

first Nations @-@ Youth use Hip Hop to express themselves and sustain their own culture
recording a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

&quot; youth of the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics , which are important for them . they do they work with Hip Hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour since 2014 , Work@@ wear managers will bring directly to schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audi@@ o- and video production and live appearances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by P@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked with the C@@ ree Hip Hop Group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is that the young participants in talks topics such as &quot; cultural identity , speech , argument , love , self acceptance , or whatever meaning can be found in the sense . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos;@@ Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ al@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells for example the story of highway 16 , also &quot; highway of the tears , &quot; at which almost two dozen most indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were largely unknown .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the mot@@ if of a video player to convey , how important is the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences from globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation recorded , the refrain is sung to C@@ ree . &quot;
the young people involved received some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop group who gave them a stand in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ Twitter of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an stands at the St@@ rop@@ he in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English that is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on Earth my days
that is the day you will take our cry
because we lost our way in life as a youth
&quot; but I believe that we will rise up one day , &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
how can they grow and help in our youth
this is how they can do what the Creator has determined

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic courts .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are close to the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin L@@ pur@@ u ( a place of extra , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) from each food produced in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers can look at these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ red district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of these small businesses that produce even those plas@@ ma dishes , which documented the German fil@@ mm@@ akers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese people , these plastic dishes are so usual that they are not even more striking to them . however , a new trend trans@@ forms it today in show@@ y cell accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; by Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome released the blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ok . &quot;
now in special sale : new with plastic de@@ duc@@ ted cell bands as shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ sch@@ y items , as in this case , refriger@@ ation magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a couple of Sho@@ wn cooling mag@@ net for a new show in Tokyo .
the new boom of Essen@@ ti@@ ations is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular tourist bowl with seafood turned into a mobile phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as mobile phone stru@@ ts .
also this part we made for the exhibition in the Tokyo train station .
&quot; and here is an apple , which cap@@ tures your mobile phone : &quot;
&quot; designed to watch like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing ascent to the com@@ ic .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile designer allow you to establish your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a is used or salmon s@@ oth@@ ed , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can hide my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I believe I will probably be the one .
&quot; this interest in plastic materials can also take a less appe@@ tizing form , to surprise for example colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile phone rings has the shape of mel@@ ting ice .
&quot; in addition , there is also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic courses can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the has@@ ht@@ ag # , &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi who is dedicated to the popularity of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sho@@ ok . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic courses are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports in@@ - and foreign media about the in@@ cum@@ bent &quot; fight against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ es and det@@ ects regularly only in statistics . they do not at all reflect the extent of the human tragedy against this struggle . &quot;
&quot; the reporting of drug bos@@ ses , such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the boss of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , created the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , no one looks at the grape or the communities who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; standing behind each cor@@ pse , behind each bon@@ ing in the hundreds of married grass , the stories of zah@@ ll@@ os@@ er parents , sons and daughters , friends and affiliates , whose wo@@ unds might never heal . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with drug trading live &quot; ) , which tells these victims a voice and told stories about people who were struggling to fight against criminal authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime cannot only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much profound .
&quot; for example , if stores close , because they are threatened by drug dealers , and whole churches have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changed &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , which is married every weekend of secret tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost only one day her father , her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again for the task we have asked to go and go to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ anj@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on 15 October he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are standing by the insurance of my father , but who doesn &apos;t get it out , because they demand a dying person . &quot;
where are we supposed to get ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid of . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the government . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader from Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexican . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , regardless of what type of activity occurs : &quot;
disease and sensation journ@@ alism I have been doing now for some years now .
&quot; I come over every day at tim@@ ber@@ ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with images , which actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from the fields of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the Only , the sho@@ cked or sad . it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body once . &quot;
I cannot be arbitr@@ ary or consider this as normal .
it continues to write :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if it is great . and it is also not normal that people can hear songs about &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is , when they were those who have lost someone who have lost someone and those who fear that something has happened . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories are to mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the mer@@ ging of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified that they were &quot; emerging . &quot; &quot;
I think they try to argue that they are spar@@ ed from such trag@@ e@@ dies if they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico @-@ Stadt wrote the article &quot; Four months of ext@@ or@@ tion in the main city district : as a family with threats has been pl@@ under@@ ed , until it was destroyed by their business until they were destroyed not only the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
&quot; you think of everything you have lost , and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; the pain about it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back , if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are away from each other , the better . &quot;
it included her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , for you do not know when they are kidn@@ apped or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would solve my profound feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to wept . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a marked by force of violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction he raises questions like , who takes care of the child of a miss woman and a man who was mur@@ dered by the organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city Mexi@@ kos ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; br@@ yan is a commodity and he tells you had to teach himself how to bo@@ iling a egg coo@@ ks , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies which is with him . this is his name for preparing the fl@@ akes with water , sugar and milk pul@@ ver . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left B@@ one - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he said to him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been past two years before , when he only saw some blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father saw that by armed men out of a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born as a br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most endangered city in the world due to the number of the Mor@@ de according to the council of public security and government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , the Public Prosec@@ utor of 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut of 8.5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundred thousand stories that organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in view of getting new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data called in life , whose aim is to portr@@ ay the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trading , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flick@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ ARN@@ ING : this entry and the pages that it linked , include images , on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important for a moment in which it is about to lift a ru@@ mor or fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after something is sur@@ faced ? content in social media , regardless of whether true or un@@ true , t@@ ends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it was mis@@ led to be@@ ating trag@@ e@@ dies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this wrong p@@ airing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dr@@ aft News - deny it not the fact that there is a lot of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a petrol station wagon the place of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pped over and explo@@ ded . there were 230 people killed . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa had been neglected and devast@@ ated land for years and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became a dangerous path of stroke which were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; typically , that the tank @-@ car fell to the victim . &quot;
&quot; the by@@ ists described a fire@@ ball , the du@@ t@@ ant houses , including a cinema close by which was full of people , which illustr@@ ates the football world championship . &quot;
houses wast@@ ed and fo@@ al cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to un@@ mistak@@ ably .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User My@@ stic@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015 Multi@@ ere photos of the incident , form the gray pictures of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows a fo@@ al body that suits the ground up while people are viewing them .
but here the story does not find their end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not in the context of standing trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 the fighters of Bok@@ o Har@@ am took the bom@@ b villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
eye witnesses reported dramatically of atro@@ cities before they had to fl@@ ee .
houses and shops were burned down and sur@@ names in streets and bus@@ hes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; the numbers could not be confirmed but no one remained back to count , &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many have been crus@@ hed , shot or burned . &quot;
only by satellite images could be depic@@ ted on the following time .
&quot; the reason for the attack also remained un@@ explained , but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of Bok@@ o Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the image from the DR Congo has again seen as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented here :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ used use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ conc@@ eptions ; Africa Check has been documents for Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all of these cases , the image was taken as a proof of mass@@ acres . &quot;
&quot; another step further bring personal comments like this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange joined in Myanmar with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Br@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a light@@ ning , issued by the United Nations , those who could fl@@ ee could fl@@ ee , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , po@@ sts po@@ sts as the following on who brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab retro@@ spect , which in 2012 asser@@ ted that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ a Being have said , mon@@ ks and politicians have participated in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to record this information . &quot;
&quot; the original block , which last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , AF@@ P as their source , were also cau@@ tious so that His statement also had written this testimony , but had not been associated with the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false coupl@@ ings will reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere around the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; revers@@ ed image search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed borders . &quot;
a revers@@ ed image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found below 18.0 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images found in the fashionable image from the DR Congo is very similar .
&quot; they originate from a mixing private pages , platforms social media and Community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have for@@ warded false reports and have tried other attempts to un@@ f@@ eit@@ ed the f@@ eit@@ ing .
&quot; we have identified examples for the ab@@ usive usage and associated with the respective countries , on which page they have been published . therefore , we want to be more evident than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the listed below ( which were linked together in some cases ) , several examples of ab@@ usive use have been used . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be split completely off ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
countries examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange @-@ native countries indicate pages or servers , about the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ oods are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gr@@ ay are examples , the according to met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ eye , probably also counter@@ feit games . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed at Alg@@ eri@@ er and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; one side , the ru@@ mo@@ urs can be discovered , presented in question that the said photo Christians were killed that were killed by Muslims . &quot;
Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this post a blog@@ ger from Quebec City does not only refer to the mis@@ question , but also discussed the abuse of the image from the DR Congo related to Nigeria and further questions about the intensi@@ fication of persons and the trag@@ e@@ aved trag@@ e@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; &quot; en Nigeria Est@@ án quem@@ ando a los Cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burned the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca quoted as his source of the Spanish news agency E@@ fe ( although not known whether the original report has the image included ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; dating back to the mass@@ acre of Bok@@ o Har@@ am as this here , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly seen no sides such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that rel@@ oc@@ ate this . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faul@@ ty use of the image since 2011 in connection with Nigeria , then promoted by a post of US @-@ American , anti @-@ Islamic comm@@ ent@@ ators in Pam@@ ela G@@ eller . &quot;

Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo has been classified as proof of the bom@@ bing of Bok@@ o Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion . &quot;
Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia can give two extreme examples of an ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo , with one on the one hand , the sympathy to the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blog@@ gers , the alleg@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persec@@ uted , as yet the photos of it were ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government released a right direction on what she said to be &quot; &quot; visi@@ bly fin@@ ed news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this judges , which has been published exclusively on English , also contains references to f@@ ake images of ru@@ m@@ ors , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to set out that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hist@@ s and elsewhere ( which is often distributed by bur@@ sting nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this mail that directed itself to the members of the Russian orthodo@@ x community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news @-@ hand asser@@ ted that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein has been vac@@ ated in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians were involved in the k@@ ill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story with the image of S@@ ange together . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image continues to be included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article of 2014 about students who have been killed by Bok@@ o Har@@ am , published by the Catholic Church of An@@ ál@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly explained that the picture is not of the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that it &apos;s a &quot; similar d@@ war@@ ring attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ acre of Bok@@ o Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ ery@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ d@@ y@@ uy &quot; ( Nigeria , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo emerged , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ has@@ ht@@ ag , and delet@@ es a discussion among Muslims after the mass@@ acre of Bok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 and the Connection to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities were taking this kind of events , which were buried in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was reduced as proof of the mass@@ acre of Bok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were linked to this were in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to focus attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reporting relevant in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Arabic ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was supposedly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , translated it discussion like this here on the Vietnamese and declared it to the wrong . &quot;
&quot; from the Embassy in which the picture was included from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) shows Tin@@ eye , but are no longer completely trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
&quot; ( data entries with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler , and disp@@ ens@@ ed it in terms of image names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . ) &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original un@@ gl@@ ade of 2010 , the image may ultimately be a correct description but the original block is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two powerful topics or Fr@@ ames ( cap@@ tions ) who crosses these po@@ sts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in regards to greater discussions about silence in connection with the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming is used to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot give these images any longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who have inci@@ dental to ex@@ ert the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggest that mood of faul@@ ty and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and slim it the actual gra@@ ves of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread rap@@ ed pictures has already been deb@@ ited ( here for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the resign@@ ation of images of a ref@@ us@@ al , however , is to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the worry that violent paintings reader and audience is des@@ ensi@@ tizing and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , who looked like violent media to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss a lot of rap@@ es@@ y depic@@ tions in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; T@@ echn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will be thorough about situation in which a picture can suggest something that actually , however , can be dis@@ solved by the context or completely ab@@ used type . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation is wrong , but also take into consideration how international they can be . &quot;

&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( eg . uns@@ ur@@ able ) endeav@@ or to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or not at all translate . &quot;
&quot; such words are in any language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these in@@ estim@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all res@@ ist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; one word or expression is not enough , why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been gathered for a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ ape language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ an your parents in recognition of how to make you tried in your younger years .
&quot; and words in H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that one feels when you have grown on cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they resol@@ ute other cultures , reve@@ aling other thought @-@ length and wake up our det@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you affect how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is concerned with the worst fl@@ ut@@ al disaster of the decade .
the island of Sri Lanka is currently looking at the worst high @-@ water and terrestrial disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , who normally uses the river Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the shore . &quot;
&quot; following an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and gor@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; over 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) , and roughly 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe places of stay . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the gaps in some areas were slowly returning . &quot;
health and hygiene of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the floo@@ ding disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods are wor@@ ded the Den@@ gu@@ ef@@ i@@ eb@@ erk@@ rise , war@@ ns the Children , after more rain falls already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the flood water , water stood up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da with G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the yesterday crossing the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the air force has five planes for b@@ ail@@ out campaigns , and another five are made for transport of st@@ ats for those in their floo@@ ded villages . &quot;
also different organizations and start @-@ ups have been prepared to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ inas in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high @-@ water supply and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue operations for their operations need , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;

use Re@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love .
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she familiar to me her children , she is my rock in fire . &quot;
in one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ andi@@ zing we rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are in a sea of rain @-@ ear@@ ms and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound by an American flag , other sk@@ andi@@ zing par@@ ole against anti @-@ hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend look at me and says , &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims , &quot; I ask myself . &quot;
I already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their conception . &quot;
you ent@@ mus@@ li@@ ze me .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well designed in our collective imagination , that once Muslims , which as I do not match there , be mus@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
to become un@@ mus@@ li@@ zed
I am not alone with that alone .
&quot; that is even the poet , whose poetry is selling in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what pictures do you come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i as old as I am now he was a orthodo@@ x@@ er Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
&quot; Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea , religion was deleted as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
another consists in the reduced images of Muslims that Western books have been colon@@ ized for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man that you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ ines the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images have also been standing further today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ban them . &quot;
I worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative was domin@@ ating our News@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ shadows the reality , which resulted in nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential guard . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v failed to realize that if French , Muslim women are forced to carry her head to@@ wel in public buildings and to cover sau@@ di Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it looks that the first Muslim prayers have been spoken in American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , who were brought here with slave @-@ ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination , so deep and faul@@ ty that often Si@@ kh men and children are to aim to an@@ tim@@ us@@ li@@ zed attacks and sh@@ allo@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the other . &quot;
part of the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we are doing more than just stories to tell , based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
&quot; and my industry has failed to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
and we are here that seven million Muslims constitute the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the total Muslim population are African Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigration of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .

four decades ago my parents were invited to live in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother placed her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrapers of New York ; sky@@ scrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ um@@ wo@@ unded Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ change@@ able Muslims and American ?
&quot; sometimes if people wonder why I don &apos;t have a pig meat , I say - instead of my mus@@ li@@ ous recipes or to wear my hand@@ shake recipes that all Muslims join with you - &quot; &quot; respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I li@@ ze , we do not carry all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us . &quot;
&quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security spots on the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ar , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists who try to fight widely spread lies across Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing tape by a well @-@ established Islam@@ ist machine , th@@ ink tanks , and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ information which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stran@@ ger who leaves a woman the sh@@ to@@ wel . &quot;

I would like to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of an Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; describe social scientist religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief and behaviour is perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend would see my neighbour , my rock in the fire that I am Muslims , when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the sole ritual with my daughter when I wi@@ ped them into my arms and her the Arab verses , to protect the Qur &apos;an and the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; it is the picture of it that I can see in this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its full and un@@ finished paintings , a book with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters that can almost wi@@ red it . &quot;
&quot; Muslims have to be to speak the prayers , who said to me , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims , as she brought me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over centuries - by a &quot; Empire &quot; colonial was founded , which has founded a company called Hon@@ orary Bri@@ lic Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Komp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only master . &quot;

&quot; belonging to knowing that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , their families , as at my grandfather , by col@@ oni@@ alists have been torn apart from the Muslim world as in the game risk . &quot;
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans all have to col@@ oni@@ alised to four Muslim countries .
&quot; it means knowing that the first a@@ erial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story in front of a century about a Muslim country was rejected . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indo @-@ Russian sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; , &quot; since he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before it existed , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops , distributed over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tica , were distributed in Iraq , the mass destruction of weapons that did not exist . &quot;
knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried among the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslims to know that self @-@ rate was increased by veter@@ ans since 2001 by more than 32 percent .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy says the United States , and the susp@@ ects a Muslim &apos;s name bears the story four times more than a story with a white attacks . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves by the name of Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought to this land . &quot;
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth that I feel , when people crowded the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and if we say black lives .
&quot; to be a American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , the in@@ dur@@ ated inter@@ c@@ tion@@ ality of our multi @-@ multiple identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1,@@ 7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduction of branches &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to make me care of my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people are erect on this doubt structural Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ ism is in the Muslim govern@@ ors , which began with President Bush and have been expanded under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in regular monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it exists in the immigration , that takes five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it consists in a country that closes its limits to people from just the countries , which it is bom@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; it is a false and neb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly @-@ list , &quot; which largely refers to Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we bring , and the bom@@ bs that we have ab@@ ject on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;

we are too deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ r@@ ze the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous printers , which we owe to our news . &quot;

&quot; but I am worried about this difficult global timing , where we are . &quot;
&quot; and this moment has consequences , which go beyond the 1.7 billion . &quot;
&quot; there is one reason for conspir@@ acies that existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House lead . &quot;
they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they have made Muslims to others .
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ ential by doing the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a few years ago it had not yet given them ; now they domin@@ ate big areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am worried about the realities and the story , which I was not aware when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who made me today an un@@ ambig@@ uous Muslim . &quot;
things I left here like a bread track in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , for in all the inter@@ tw@@ ins that makes our humanity like a story , where anyone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations will be held within the framework of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; but these are no terms , with which we usually throw us in our schools or read our newspapers . &quot;

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell that here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people caused by the work of the &quot; others &quot; in the public vision , four decades even researchers of the Stan@@ ford was . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions about the role of being aware and un@@ aware of the &quot; &quot; others &quot; , &quot; as it was my girlfriend and I stayed in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , while he bom@@ bed us a new future in which we have already bombar@@ ded countries and &quot; to other ma@@ stered &quot; people , goes far beyond the invisible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ ator intends to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; stor@@ yt@@ eller , Flick@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ N@@ D 2.0 . &quot;
can there be an opportunity to contact someone here and now despite a voice barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the creation of stories in their original language is a possible response to it . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written one , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed for 2015 events , the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not pass on to the children born children . &quot;
for the creators of the project is :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided , if we create cities , the diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often associated with it , to understand &quot; purposes these events instead &quot; the listening to make to feel cl@@ assy . &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers show their story first in their own language and then explain them in English .
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and their representation is to make their audi@@ ences on it . &quot;
they call laughter and emotions as if the language no longer a barrier .

Puerto Rico calls for the United States re@@ formation of the state debt
&quot; with the aim of a new examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , founded on 3 April 2017 , various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the American Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was named by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( civil Front for the re @-@ examination of debts ) and the eco @-@ Arab church assembly in Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of re @-@ determination of debts also have submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the People of Puerto Ri@@ cos demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government authorities , who are responsible for debts to be held responsible for their corrupt . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial examination and a committee committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , appropriate working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will press and suppres@@ sed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refused to pay a debt , which is not their . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with decl@@ ining pay@@ outs .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not into the state of the built @-@ built territory of the United States - suffering from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a ruling non @-@ profit organization without Party @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law of state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restruc@@ ture of state infrastructure .
&quot; imposed from the outside , without the participation and conviction of the citizens are at risk to be rejected by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; night@@ watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web@@ develop@@ er Bass@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions that he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s annual : publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture , which is arranged in Berlin , an event of the # Free@@ b@@ ass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ y D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a researcher of the published CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of the Book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective re@@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which has been published last year and is available here license @-@ free , contains a number of attempts which deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
&quot; this book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built , and what the real cost is to which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designer , developers , designers , designers , designers , researchers , researchers , who have been involved in movements for free knowledge , have to look into the fo@@ g that surrounds our News@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free b@@ ass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and consolidated internet volunteers , who has been incar@@ cer@@ ated since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his present state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book , with the title Coll@@ ective memory , gives his friends and family a voice that pushing for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how bass player pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us can let &apos;s start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we now here ?
why did we choose ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time @-@ wise con@@ vic@@ tions ?
the web@@ developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the cust@@ ody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el was born from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and An@@ chor@@ tin N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el &quot; reported on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who mo@@ cked himself as an insi@@ der of the Assad &apos;s government , and put them aware of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
but his place of residence and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , T@@ echn@@ ologi@@ ans and currently crossing the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes are looking forward to the work , which he began with a group of arche@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arche@@ ological sites in the world , the cross@@ roads of numerous civili@@ zations and mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; b@@ ass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after having started with this work , the IS would put all of it , this architecture that em@@ bo@@ died not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip @-@ suit into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a period of time , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ alu@@ able value . &quot;
&quot; typically , b@@ ass@@ el of this project has not yet been able to complete this project . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my whole life with it , of liberty to dream and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English with me even when he was already in cust@@ ody .
&quot; I learned to read English well , write and speak . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with each , who has asked . he has taught other incar@@ nations to read and speak English . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el has opened the door to technology . he taught me , both computer and smartphones . &quot;
he brought me the internet with me .
&quot; he has also brought up other prisoners , as they use computers , at least theoretically , without having in their hands they were in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a Pro@@ sab@@ a , which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 her husband , when he was in cust@@ ody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for one year .
she sm@@ ug@@ ged the lyrics to him if she visited him and he translated them from the Arabian into English .

&quot; it happens with every visit , &quot;
that I fail in the world of your enchanting eyes
&quot; that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that each of the dangers is no matter , &quot;
&quot; everyone of the f@@ ences , bonds and guar@@ di@@ ans &quot;
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I revol@@ t in every detail of your voice and words
that I wear with passion for me
if your eyes are saying

&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;

I persu@@ ade myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ sels &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests of 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) have disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or forced on violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation of Am@@ nest@@ y International , at least 17 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans died in cust@@ ody . &quot;
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ a since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption repression head after prison sentence back to previous post .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que re@@ acted with anger on a corrupt event in which a ruling member was returned to the workplace at the state apparatus in which the corruption was committed .
&quot; this is about Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in 2010 with four other def@@ endants ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money dom@@ ed from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council Cam@@ b@@ aza is pre@@ valent between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately asked its return to the company what happened on 19 April .
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the General Staff of the Republic , which exc@@ eeds the request , there would be no obstacles to refer to Cam@@ b@@ aza to his old post , since the company was not a lack of discipl@@ in@@ ation after his confin@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; however , too many inhabitants do not have the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Center for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , briefly C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to establish the director again : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption , and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a retreat with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company should have a lack of discipline against the ref@@ ut@@ ant .
&quot; however , the company sho@@ ok , however , and promp@@ ted no adequate legal steps to use the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , reject this behavior as well as regards the case as &quot; &quot; res@@ ist &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and that half of them did eat . &quot;
&quot; he could maintain lectures and motiv@@ ating talk , he could advise and his image . &quot;
&quot; but as he is in@@ competent , he has changed to be rein@@ t@@ ained in the company , which he helped to cause damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for its silence . &quot;
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ que and Student of Political Science in Brazil , the director poss@@ essed no mor@@ ality : &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza rewarded by the state because he in@@ anim@@ ate him I can not believe that someone has been rewarded in such a way that the state has already been so massive .
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ ality to return and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it is only served by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as hand@@ craf@@ ted to become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source , and the state itself is tired , who was sentenced , and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , I do not know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are in the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , cat@@ chy , and - in other words - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was to be energetic , that &quot; a ambitious man was capable of everything , even the f@@ ather@@ land for its ambitions , its own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes the tactics , but it does not change from its ambitions . &quot;
a ambitious person is criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also distr@@ acting :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat 10 years and came free .

Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users .
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ age .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their assets from the network , because they un@@ v@@ oked the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East indi@@ an origin , or generally used as an adj@@ ective &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ed the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or a man ( in bur@@ sting writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the Hass@@ an in Burma in the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radi@@ cal@@ al nation@@ alistic movements has given the Word to an extremely valuable g@@ onn@@ ation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is often used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight a hate language in Myanmar , the company has ens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on his platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; today likes to be associated with racism , but the word itself is not calling the hate speech automatically . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word , or have a doubt to express their use . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic different mean@@ ings which have the same character as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
&quot; a post of one of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; however , he had asked his friends on the spiritual nature , whether they knew how he can hin@@ der his back pain , as he did a word game . &quot;
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ o - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; in Win , it is the opinion that it will reduce the Hass@@ an radi@@ cal@@ al nation@@ alists , but also that Facebook can be analytical , before there are all po@@ e@@ s that divide into suspic@@ ion of racism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
fil@@ tering the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you write on fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , the post office is carefully analysed and control it by checking the next words . &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; ( butter@@ fly ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists are spreading the hate speech , a rather good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ed its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often is a cross @-@ cat@@ ching and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply to begin to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the c@@ anned word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung described , how Facebook started to clear his po@@ sts , when he only wanted to share his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to let my Facebook friends know that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and me , the Li@@ ken , posts and parts of content for 24 hours was prohibited because the post office has not met the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has a variety of po@@ sts of people , who have no negative intentions or which simply try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ an radi@@ cal@@ al nation@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his Post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the mail , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country have bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ mes@@ an Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to decrease racism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
such words can be em@@ med only more hat@@ red within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out , they didn &apos;t have made mistakes , they tried not to correct the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; if they had only something more respect for the 15 million benefit they would have a large turnover , it would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users can now talk about Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their po@@ sts are taken from the grid . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Po@@ sts , which have no hate speech , but nevertheless have been removed : &quot;
with permission .
the bur@@ sting text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and view pe@@ sen@@ curr@@ y and watch an Indian movie .
&quot; just to check out whether Facebook remo@@ ves the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screens@@ hot with permission .
&quot; post a doctor If you are a doctor , heal then people ? &quot;
screens@@ hot with permission .
&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks , the violence in the commun@@ es in Myanmar are in addition to heating , particularly in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been for its failure , cri@@ tici@@ zed hate speech on his bur@@ ial sites under control . &quot;
&quot; but instead of c@@ ensor the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it could have been better than focused on the context than on the code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trin@@ id@@ ad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the children
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s h@@ ehe is illeg@@ ally illegal in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided to provide a law that this practice has to offer , so that the pag@@ an age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change in adul@@ tery , some members held hin@@ d@@ ran@@ istic and mus@@ li@@ ous religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , the leaders of the inter @-@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state does not interv@@ ene , as that , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago is an contractual partner of the UN Child &apos;s rights law , the min@@ ors of children under 18 years of age . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 , in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistics of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which stri@@ ves to create laws for stro@@ ck , followed by the foot and were great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not all went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du @-@ leader , for example , had no concerns , the critics of the children before saying , they should take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition en@@ du@@ red for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated cause , and at some point a doubt whether the opposition would agree to the law . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of 2017 , the draft law was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which had been discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree with and pro@@ claim the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave us an status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle is again posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
&quot; Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against children , was decided in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , with 35 voices and no one against it . &quot;
&quot; having been decided before in the Senate , the design can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media user was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws had finally been changed to the children &apos;s marriage .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary talk used to conc@@ e@@ aled the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s h@@ ehe is illegal in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson of opinion was , it was definitely long enough to finish the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas overwhel@@ med that the day has finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , &quot; Out@@ standing news ! &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , belonged to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil@@ ised social group that spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law has been noted . &quot;
the pag@@ an old age in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation to the age of 18 .
&quot; the draft for the amendment of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 , decided . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , there are 41 MPs and of them were present at the voting . &quot;
&quot; all the members , who were against , have voted for the law . &quot;
the children &apos;s h@@ ehe is permitted by law in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ ri@@ ag@@ ei@@ sch@@ ild@@ abuse .

a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aja , therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du Organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aja has announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to rede@@ em his promises . &quot;
&quot; during the General @-@ convention Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it is quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aja would set against the law , the majority of social media users would be able to address the debate differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , if we think instead of keeping the discussion so generally , in a way that the state would like to say that our daughters are protecting , our daughters are protecting , that they may possibly be of great , hard @-@ ges@@ tive men that are likely to be ab@@ used , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
&quot; but if it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places on the world where children are legal or remain the standard even though there are laws they say . &quot;

by the mir@@ rors of websites you can see Turkish users back Wikipedia content
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was represented on 18 January 2012 , opposing the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright laws in the US , internationally . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month , Turkey has been developing the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enzy@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; day by day becomes more evident , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ por@@ ter and fans of TV series are committed against blocking .
&quot; although many Engine@@ ers are used to use locker tools for blocking websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VP@@ N prevalence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been writing articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society in Harvard University has been adopted , regular block@@ ages of the internet since 2007 was adopted after the Internet Law ( No 56@@ 51 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the best @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , there are several mir@@ ror@@ sites ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often be updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer hosts connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;
the content is not available despite legal pro@@ hibition .
in a blog@@ post reports IP@@ FS about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put all of it to check snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus there is the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to look at least any Wikipedia content , even if you cannot achieve the website www.@@ black@@ .com. &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also made that this step was performed independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it merely involves screen@@ shots and no live versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ mir@@ rors , an open source project that everyone can use to illustrate similar mir@@ ror@@ sites if in the respective country Wikipedia is suspended . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as staff at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
&quot; you can access a different URL , which is not the original one . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; in essence , the server guides the query to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then when these are locked in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; for this is run by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot;
a ne@@ pal@@ es@@ ic wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a sw@@ aying Nas@@ horn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around you , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poorly positioning moti@@ fs and well @-@ rated colors . &quot;
the motivated him self to carry a camera with yourself and try to examine the situation .
at that time he was a kid .
&quot; today , in the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar attempts to bring Sag@@ ar to the international scene . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , who draw attention to Nep@@ alese animals . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I am straight back home when I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my Father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river was a leop@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
&quot; immediately , I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes there . &quot;
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was and I immediately began to cr@@ ush pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ alese nature , and would like to raise awareness that wild animals are not as terrible as they look like . &quot;
&quot; and he should know , for he stood up to the tig@@ ers from face to face . &quot;
a tiger can not be disturbing from the opinion of the sheep not to sleep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ har@@ ks appeared immediately , we see ourselves and he star@@ ry me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ des for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ alese and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days long and lived in a tent in order to take in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he took a tiger photograph , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist area . &quot;

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ ona@@ az Kaly@@ m@@ wal@@ a , and originally appeared on Video Volunte@@ ers , a award @-@ winning international community organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was again published as part of a Content Shar@@ ing Convention .
in many parts of India there are women with great care to speak the name of their spouse or even older men in the family .
instead they use a prono@@ uns or say &apos; father of my child .
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh give women to respect they respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should be the norm dis@@ regarded this practice in life . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a hypo@@ cris@@ p , and rejected by her family and the village community after having raised a attached relative to names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition their wives also do not name in the name , is also common among men . however , they have far less access to fear , if not at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel , and house@@ wives , a unique club , and were thus fast to the main theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place just for them alone , to discuss and discuss the int@@ ric@@ acies of the patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volunte@@ ers and is committed to the dismant@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to un@@ cover practices , such as children &apos;s marriage up to the ban@@ ishment of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS In@@ ner , and guides these clubs . &quot;
they reported how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously have made an amb@@ ass@@ ination of the change at the same time .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion round , was of women who do not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open a conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; speaking to the name of their spouse is not loud , a burning is maintained and never posed to question . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wishes him long life .
&quot; a woman who does not keep this , is considered to be back as a woman without mor@@ ality . &quot;
tradition is deeply rooted in that we have never had thought about this discussion about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini had never named Roh@@ ini who had never called her husband to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband sm@@ ashed a long time after the video was at an end .
&quot; Pr@@ ak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I can name him from now on with his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh .
&quot; after the video project , the women tried to bring discussion with a practice in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , angry , sad , aff@@ ection@@ ate and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all the &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our sp@@ ouses , but they can call us how they want , that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her spouse over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the break@@ age of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married women the name of her husband will never be able to speak . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she took her during the whole exercise only in front of her ; a different decided to let the whole cr@@ ammed frustration against him and his family by cur@@ se him away .
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in adren@@ alin , having an ancient Br@@ auch broke , the women decided that they would actually try home to name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
and they held their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas they put in his head : his wife could not stop his name . &quot;
another cl@@ ub@@ a member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she war@@ ped , she got fear and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I was doing it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less comprehen@@ sible and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the galvan@@ izing red point on the forehead , which shows the sp@@ ouses : &quot;
why must only women show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ ess @-@ red spot if he also worked . &quot;
he laughs and I listened to him to wear him .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but they mean , they are now in a better position , even to choose him in some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives .
&quot; we make a trip with each discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make the women worry about who could hear what they hear , &quot; says . &quot;
&quot; during the last months they celebrated her own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives , they danced , and spoke about things that they never had thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , but I also have spoken about some things , for example as our identi@@ ties to our sp@@ ouses , have never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to tell certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothing .
some women in the group have been carried only Sar@@ is in the group since their marriage .
&quot; for most it is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ inity @-@ cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ants ; they have not dr@@ unk . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes choice , mor@@ ality connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , narro@@ wing Roh@@ ini their own pair of cur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will be able to create . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months have changed since their first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things slowly come into roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then they listened to the name of their spouse . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it yet , but only when they are alone and have no other family members . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now contribute to any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
the women in the disc@@ ussion@@ ist know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the sol@@ em@@ ing of more freedom of movement or its own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . it will give a chain reaction if any woman goes home in the club and reported other people of it what we talk about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the incar@@ n@@ ated Chinese Dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in international community after his lawyer was announced at the end of June , that he has been delivered to hospital due to liver cancer in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( ICTY ) in 2009 , having asked himself on the draft of the Charter 08 , a Mani@@ fes@@ to , which challenged the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China has called Li@@ us Fall as a &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man says he did not need it as &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to be taking views of the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or give him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely obsc@@ ured . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
unified nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Com@@ miss@@ ary of the United Nations for Human Rights , met the Fall of Li@@ u at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man continued to comment on whether the United Nations exercise pressure should allow a treatment to Li@@ u abroad . &quot;
Norway Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ing have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came into shock , after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government broke out that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; the diplomatic relations were continued until the December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon ports after China , since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; once the message was circul@@ ated that Li@@ u was seriously realized , the Nobel @-@ Committee brought his hope for an unconditional release to express and lu@@ d Li@@ u to get his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was not able to receive his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July the European Parliament adopted a decision where China was promp@@ ted to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately by house arrest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top Diplom@@ atin of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , calling for China also for the release of Li@@ us on how they did in an explanation on 30 June . &quot;
&quot; we expect China to stand all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife , as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; you should meet all visits and receive guests who wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA and USA
&quot; US amb@@ assador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; would like him that he has the opportunity to treat abroad , in that respect it would help him . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Poll@@ ey , announced the message agency AF@@ P on June 27th , that the message of the Chinese authorities would not only release Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the solic@@ itation of the U.S. message went an angry response from China to himself , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; no country have the right to have inter@@ change@@ able and in@@ competent remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
poll@@ en shared with that China should offer the following :
&quot; protect and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ kl@@ ey and Ted Cruz have just introduced a decision in Congress to release the Chinese government on it , Li@@ u and his wife uncondi@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o uncondi@@ tionally so that he can enter into proper medical treatment . http : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o

the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was published on 7 and 8 July at G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic springs in Beijing of the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could be over@@ written for a visit to Hamburg . &quot;

&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um said to provide adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to give him care of his family . &quot;

&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was strictly pun@@ ished for which he had led to a harmon@@ ious , stable and af@@ flu@@ ent of China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt very moved personally and also encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected people , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may appear stupid as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Minister K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International subsidiary of the Law@@ yers Association of the State of New York , the Ministers agreed that many people were cri@@ tici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
&quot; he sponsor , that Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot;
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a land .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Minister , &quot; to rot@@ ate logic to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ es , this valuable country , you hear that we are ultimately not a land . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had a breach of a flight before the responsibilities , a breach of breach . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , the country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons for Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &apos;s reasons were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one cannot measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of its , he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , he has defended the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared , equally cities that are permanently being led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old cor@@ es emerg@@ es from the author@@ itarian rulers , leaving the democr@@ ats , because they fit better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final event that the last week of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ates with non @-@ responses ration@@ ally kind .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ gr@@ ug@@ am to illustrate his opinion as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to sw@@ allow .
&quot; when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; shortly , I understand nothing . &quot;
I would be very thankful when our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take the trouble on himself to clear this point if he was highly paid to be part of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by clicking on the blog of his comment , he indicates that the cri@@ tique of the conference should begin to understand the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference , in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the co @-@ ordin@@ ance .
&quot; he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; explained why the elections in Singapore said so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he moved Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party over a decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously has not meant it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an reveals his disappointment on Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who makes a leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ical testimony . &quot;
&quot; I am about what the judicial Minister of Singapore said , very well ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew by Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old gar@@ de , what I expect - whether I agree with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes correctly and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review defines the weakness of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ ams arguments :
did Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; accepted a mistake &quot; or was it a defi@@ antly mis@@ speaker ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be seen as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government of the government , the statements of Mr Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of heavy importance . &quot;
&quot; why do they do the Singapur of their military service , they defend themselves only their own city but not their land ? &quot;
who has to re@@ pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink recruitment ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; in Singapore , the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is always a city : &quot;
&quot; I did not say , what I said ... &quot;
this phrase seems to have anno@@ yed many herbs ...
&quot; no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we always had a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; defence of the country above all &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should speak more of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
screens@@ hot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked her editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
&quot; their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the ru@@ mo@@ urs of certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et will be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question which is placed in Japan most , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , I answered . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live here and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation is taking place , it is considered polite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then , on my clar@@ inet often follows the standard answering : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Eis@@ hockey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook perhaps inn@@ ed before w@@ ut when they are kept for Americans , but me don &apos;t distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian Flag visible on their back@@ pack when they &apos;re travelling .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans in the same ... .
&quot; it was the way I began to travel through the world - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before 11 September . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small a@@ hor@@ n@@ sheets in their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
with us there is no weapons !
gender @-@ mar@@ riages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate the .
&quot; first , I have many American friends I enjoyed very much . &quot;
there would be nothing for me if one would like to switch me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first of all , as &apos; nice &apos; to be called , is basically to be sp@@ read@@ able - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tragic , un@@ significant figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; &quot; Simp@@ son &quot; &quot; ( which has an own Canadian twin ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing where you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; harmless to be un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive and un@@ interesting , and no attention to deserve . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good when you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around a lot . &quot;
&quot; I would even go so far , to say that the desire to be free and alone , a leading edge of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; described as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; is perhaps just bold . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &apos; nice &apos; . our prime minister has made Canada straight to sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop music has released a music video , which took the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ zed , which we sei@@ zed the power and restore the civil government despite their promises , continue to restore the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) , the band tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells him what rules make him his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers directly to the continued military power of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was an amazing success .
&quot; only within the first three days , that was shared on Facebook up@@ loaded Video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator was blocked , after a group of activists , called the public to watch this video . &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics as it beh@@ aves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
&quot; take a look at these recordings of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that per@@ si@@ sted in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; refers to the dr@@ ak@@ onic section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which has been absolute absolute decision @-@ making of the army holder of the army of absolute national topics . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program to &quot; change change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law about computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to destroy activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , monitored on the online content and individuals where monarchy is thrown , the monarchy is persec@@ uted , criminal prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand is committed to a Stri@@ k@@ tes against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ä@@ ts@@ hr@@ enia ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was created in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continue to buy , is their decision expensive marine boats to buy , although security experts they war@@ ned that the purchase need@@ less and a waste of tax waste . &quot;
&quot; in the video , even as individuals will be thrown into a black product line before they bring them into an interim camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison , because they said supposedly &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and internet users will attack long arrest , they should bel@@ ate the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs are members of the band , which was used the sal@@ ute of &apos; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , who has already been used by Putin @-@ opponents during protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the violin cities in the eastern part of the East Asia .

&quot; the post @-@ war company recovered only very slowly in East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has passed over 20 years since the Georgian War has officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still heavily visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the S@@ aus@@ Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , f@@ antasi@@ es , Geor@@ ing and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and far@@ es live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called Gei@@ ster@@ ols as well .
&quot; in the post @-@ war period , more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these ho@@ ons cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the &quot; &quot; 16.@@ 000 people &quot; &quot; was barely gone by over a decade . &quot;
in 1989 about 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; everything is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the ch@@ us@@ ch@@ u@@ kow@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the overthrow and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are dropped and quite rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it falls hard to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still clear . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of the community . &quot;
now there are only paved road with infl@@ atable splend@@ or @-@ buildings .
&quot; people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , we have left the district . &quot;
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; some 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ us@@ ht@@ ow@@ ow@@ kas , which are still one or two families , can be seen in the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull themselves back . &quot;
&quot; our mother allowed us to let us photograph , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply has forbidden it , that is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ per her girlfriend something to and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ qu@@ oise mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as cattle farming , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetables . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration supplies free candles in winter and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ chini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ alya how they are called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not have to leave un@@ f@@ antasi@@ es to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ arth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina would like to assume no financial aid from her daughter and insist that they instead have supported their young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas monthly pensions are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;
&quot; T@@ ante G@@ alya tells , that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays . &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we are visiting us . &quot;
but we cannot do so - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , calling a@@ unt G@@ alya ye to . &quot; they said , we could build Zu@@ c@@ chini . &quot;
I already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ chini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything
&quot; G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ant in Nat@@ asch@@ a , together with her husband and five common children lived in their house for some time . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old , when the war began . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day as the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation t@@ ends to the end , a small boy is over to us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy j@@ agt him back .
&quot; he plays with the ball , who goes down the hill . &quot;
a group of children now follows the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them shed stones for the random building . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are a part of their childhood , who care for im@@ pedi@@ ment in their lives . &quot;
they do not know it differently .

in Mexico houses &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concepci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 , on the website of our partner PRI@@ CE and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality will be known . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ e@@ ula , it is located on the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican @-@ player , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink brick @-@ ste@@ al and gold @-@ colored ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ nasty form . &quot;
it is called the Concepci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was raised in Tap@@ e@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is educated the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and ha@@ ti@@ ans who are on the journey .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with cas@@ hing , cru@@ m@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
&quot; there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are here . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard . &quot;
it does not want to decline anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are ill , they buy them drugs that they can not pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ sam that was exhausted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a jo@@ el mou@@ sta@@ che ) with the Concepci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , the hopes to get to Boston , to find their husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; you have been living in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then pull toward the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other way@@ companion from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ ti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans are often travelling together with the track and that Afri@@ cans speak already on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companion companion , Michel@@ et lived previously in Brazil and worked as a buil@@ ders for buil@@ ders of the Olympic Games and the World Cup Championship . &quot;
&quot; as the Brazilian economy , he has started his journey into the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months now , he sold SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money to buy the bu@@ cket to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; reply he smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that their guests are often sending text messages , if they have gone , to greet them , or to report them on the course of their journey . &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith in the drive of her work is .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought their homes , chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very famous here , but it is not the only Fun@@ ken hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ e@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter is Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family took migrants in their little house .
he is polic@@ eman and found that the B@@ usti@@ ft are sold to numerous African migrants to be expensive .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ er outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was designated according to a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ e@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to be black@@ ma@@ iled out of him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ e@@ ula he asked for a accommodation and a unknown , an all @-@ known , has offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the courses the travelers look calm their teleph@@ ones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems to be happy that their house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grand@@ mother she met her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair@@ pin , who made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and Old . &quot;
she laughs again while she asked me briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; she is repeated every time . &quot; &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
&quot; China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app , on their mobil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter @-@ user , or would like to find a copy of &quot;
&quot; the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are forced to install a Spy@@ ware on their mobil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July the mobile users of the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the town of Uru@@ m@@ qi received a mobile phone , in which it shows the district government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the statement , the app is said to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; but k@@ ò@@ n@@ thia , the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed short after they exchanged the app , messages with a private we@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app has been able to determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists , and follow together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ler website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ on@@ u Tel@@ ecom . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ age of porno@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users attentive how much time they spend online , and to control your own home network . &quot;
this app with fil@@ tering for min@@ ors is to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in a wide variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &apos; governmental actors or even h@@ ackers can manipul@@ ate the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al from it . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while announ@@ cements on digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and South , the reality is very often dar@@ ker for those who live in remote , un@@ law@@ ful ethnic minority regions as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme conditions and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ ail@@ ored Internet de@@ activ@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; this based on Twitter @-@ based media @-@ Out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( b ) , the writing news in China released , showed photos of a check@@ point , at the polic@@ eman the residents installed later , whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ano ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; you have forced the people to use appliances , which are for older people to use . &quot;
this is a form of cap@@ tivity by the rest technology .
we are back again in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( B , B @-@ B ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can up@@ lift the password of a Windows operating system and thus get restricted access to the computer hard drive of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a response to the instructions of the city of Party , to minimize the spread of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , authorities and the party related facilities including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office in operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , mentioned also this new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; identify and destroy them . however , this promotion hurt however the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible rewards , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : all sh@@ aking after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is his experience in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at you and you realize that you are all alone in one place where everything is important . &quot;
everything has been dis@@ solved and is un@@ vei@@ led and a truth is evident both from the inside and outside .
one that makes her name all glory .
one that has no met@@ aph@@ ors in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions that no met@@ aph@@ ors allow .
&quot; but when you get the reality again and you are behind the scenes - beyond acting , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters in beings from flesh and blood , and all sh@@ aking after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts , solve themselves in smoke and you will be aware of your existence even though Earth is going on the axis of the un@@ hei@@ ls . you &apos;ll realize that you are caught here between the walls , who have your parents , and before them thy grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have been arrested for me and my father three times , but that I don &apos;t know , so that I wanted to form@@ ulate my lesson - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he put his power over us under proof by even the simpl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn down during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
so that the city was crus@@ hed the darkness of the night with &quot; all@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all quarters of the city cov@@ eted , just my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that is thrown up into the arter@@ ies with state @-@ security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; during the third night , things had a bit so@@ othing after the power supply in the quarter heard . &quot;
&quot; I broke the still@@ ness , by doing several times &quot; &quot; Every@@ one &quot; &quot; from my home d@@ ach . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence against all .
a few minutes later some of my friends were brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we Con@@ feder@@ ate us to a beautiful picture that filled my expectations fully . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you will be aware that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but you simply won &apos;t be interested in the righteous . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet with the military security . &quot;
he placed on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can sw@@ allow - nothing can give your voice back , after you have sent it all the way up to the office of the Security Service . &quot;
I joined there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I am . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s listen to , how you are crying , or you are just brave enough to cry , if we are not close by . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ tive eyes set up on me .
&quot; and you know , what to look in the eyes , and not to the ground ! &quot;
&quot; what I did , has nothing to do with courage . &quot;
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; maybe it was on my door@@ way , E@@ it@@ el@@ ty ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure when I said , &quot; I would not think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret no word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ it@@ ary , and his father immediately with it . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sl@@ ender of this con@@ flu@@ ent set is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; he was subjected to a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a sect@@ arian torture , which I was exposed to months . &quot;
I am afraid of the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with me .
&quot; then again through the courtyard , and into the second office , which leads through a course to the individual cells . &quot;
I give me all the details just before I super@@ vise the room .
otherwise they have probably shared a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; I have to share it with only one single further prisoner , and must immediately put me up without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I went back to an old @-@ proven communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
I experienced that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; first @-@ ray . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me finally .
&quot; apparently , in no of the surrounding cells lay a respected man middle age , who sees me similar and &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , there is no mark@@ tes to me in the perfect darkness , and physicians are not given here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers had its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had in@@ sured to me , they would release him when I stay . &quot;
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
&quot; I &apos;d like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws , who lab@@ oured out in the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still listen to &quot; &quot; allergi@@ es &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time , the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that Black the color of the verse is , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Th@@ under &quot; , &quot; playing on the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
&quot; they are here , to be heard . &quot;
&quot; this was the secret to protect the state security in front of us and prevent the terrorists in us , they talk in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fes@@ sions of pres@@ iding board and betra@@ yed the close sight of the world &apos;s view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which here is not a land ; it is a cur@@ se who call it co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of her cl@@ ans into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I super@@ vise the hear@@ ings and handles on Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and stra@@ ined man ; at least he comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , &quot; despite the face expres@@ sions , the expres@@ sions : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can close as much more important to your life as you can attach this meeting and to protest on demonstrations , who will soon find an end soon . &quot;
I don &apos;t rep@@ lied .
&quot; I used to get used to me , not to answer . &quot;
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and beats after a friendly conversation for me has become an ordinary communication tool .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I didn &apos;t have to get used to get used to become pun@@ ished , although I had nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
of punishment in all their variety .
its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ able . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ ist@@ ers .
your Hen@@ ker rejo@@ iced in your scre@@ ams .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold your mess@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; my writer fell by him not enough , so that is why they controlled the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; in my first stop , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage dump , or if it belonged to the normal working class . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ woven around us , to present ourselves from their sight , great invention of a huge Kab@@ els . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them are rare , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , so I listened to crying . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling and found no favor of it for which he was charged as a neighbour to an electric charged St@@ ab .
&quot; flow through my entire body , enough to store my entire district . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ nude body , the out@@ stretched on the floor was the perfect electricity conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must be at midnight so at midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again , let me sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; several hours passed , which occurred to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to dawn .
&quot; the door opens and the dawn meets the room &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of a mur@@ ky young people : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father has to worry about . &quot;
&quot; be silent and gone away , you will be published . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b speak about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ community , free speech and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the majority of his time inside , he s@@ add@@ led to his screen , to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what one can rely on , is a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives at the top of his family house that had been living since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faced the conservative majority and asks her old well @-@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapid music . &quot;
&quot; with his music that often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but also calls on the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics do not only find in his homeland , Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that suff@@ ice from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by boundaries , and he can make fellow citizens with people who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if it is not open to the US foreign policy , he defeated a special slope against the US American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , something that has been born with his identity as &quot; Palestinian det@@ ach@@ eter of the second generation &quot; , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine until now . &quot;
&quot; I do not think of my own living conditions , says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then it adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , while he p@@ oured in water , while he p@@ oured out in water , it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in that time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the law governing law is that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal . &quot;
&quot; obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ i@@ ent hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the sk@@ id of hot coffee and the swelling of the K@@ ent cig@@ ette in the nose is first and foremost characterised by freedom .
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you thro@@ ws a look into the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do that basic things to do - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water - to not end in jail . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior of Jord@@ anian is an appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la cancelled already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary groups that support the Islamic Action Front - the j@@ ord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual fron@@ ts Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , the cultural and traditional norms of the country is contradic@@ tory and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
the members and former press conference in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the sc@@ ary .
&quot; many pret@@ end to assert the commitment of the band in affairs like the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world whether more dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the ancient legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement called M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ ian people as &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; that continues to work for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is likely to be not simply sil@@ et@@ oric rh@@ et@@ oric , but in fact a deeper understanding of the cryst@@ all@@ ine reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Werk clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender or@@ ms to Lei@@ be , having lost his vision of the fate of Arab women who have occurred . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently lower un@@ familiar woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust . &quot;
in the past years Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Hon@@ en@@ mor@@ de &apos; - the in@@ official outside left .
&quot; human Rights Watch recognized that the number of ambition in 2016 reached their peak in 2016 ; however , that Jordan is still lacking the institutional infrastructure , in order to support the women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence to assist in proper way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law concerning dis@@ rup@@ tions from the year 1954 , women are exposed to in@@ alien@@ able violence , and for their release is often a years of bureaucr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee by the family that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it , also not to be trac@@ ed to themes in his country as tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b argu@@ ed that his work is politically , but it is a fact that he can separate his music , the full explicit references to sexuality , freedom and expression , not from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I was saying to politics , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; G@@ har@@ e@@ eb &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are politically politically , can be continued . &quot;
&quot; in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a suspic@@ ion is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it too . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which you can get in his words , &quot; that can be what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , heter@@ osexu@@ ality or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans speaks and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still strongly influenced by 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian Onlin@@ e@@ Programme Ro@@ ya , in order to later note that his comments have been torn out of the context , distor@@ ted his mind . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without inc@@ isions , however , it was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the arab@@ LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance do not un@@ equi@@ p Islam to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who has remained in mind today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks themselves : if Abu Nu@@ what was to work later on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the eighth century openly could write homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier that not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with mos@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the current shareholder service took several former government members and members of the teacher , with the ration@@ ale , they were expressed on comments in social media critical to the problems which coinci@@ des with the deep in the country @-@ root corruption . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs show that only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structured change in the next generation of the Jordan river . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a continuous giving and take . Jordan , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la now sees a performance in a row , but the way of progress - it looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ side and intern@@ ation changes . he is sure that these changes came from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; I also dre@@ amed H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he had not only dre@@ amed of his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is affected by music , art and literature of a genuine and basic openness - and not by bom@@ bs , stre@@ et@@ ables and on artificial fashion . at least hop@@ ed it . &quot;
&quot; until it is far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue , and therefore also res@@ ist resistance . &quot;
this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Repor@@ ting to the A@@ man as a student Fellow .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the largest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one thought that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festivals , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory emerged that armies from West Japan were over in the north @-@ east to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to force its kne@@ es . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to sn@@ ap a few great seats , that &apos;s why we have a great view . &quot;
one can imagine only how big these parts are ...
&quot; a communal centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I looked at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two celebrations are just to be seen .

&quot; rarely , outw@@ ard appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help promote Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and to foster a legitimate profession like the hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , in the vicinity of the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smo@@ b and illegal drugs are daily . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted in April 2017 , that 5@@ 1.5 per cent of the population of this region did not feel secure . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries , rising demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous Sport@@ sman such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , which can make this elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , who go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ s &quot; Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os &quot; who has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there appear experts against each other to show who you can see from them the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on public Facebook @-@ profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; education institutions such as school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who found themselves in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to convince their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice on education in the hair@@ dressing as they allow them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered doz@@ ens of young people have seen that they can take a job , who is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; the school offered special training courses in March of March , and reported on some of their achievements : &quot;
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the community and the district where we are very proud of because of love for the children we have established this educational community .

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the paper &quot; &quot; love @-@ ships on guer@@ ri@@ lla &quot; , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
this article will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letter to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel exc@@ eed@@ ingly , affection opposite ? &quot;
&quot; just this question , the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a from the Foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation is no longer taken from the head and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( letters for reconciliation ) , the young people sometimes ex@@ val@@ ed to write guer@@ ri@@ lla letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , her country was sw@@ ings of a historic event and they wanted to help her part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guer@@ er@@ ill@@ ab@@ ew@@ ash F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the conclusions of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international was considered to be the under@@ signed of the peace agreement as such , that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received for its services in the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; however , in front of the Colom@@ bian people , however , is a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ gri@@ ff@@ ler who lived for many years in illegal camps , who were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ oric , and around the clock their weapons must be re @-@ integrate into life as a civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hat@@ red towards guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , this now needs to take up into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans have been assembled and would have to help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love @-@ ships on former guer@@ ri@@ lla war in order to welcome them back in society .
&quot; the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former gu@@ ill@@ ers , which shall be handed over to personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters for reconciliation was born on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there had Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to speak short of K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; this declared that we love the people that we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day of thousands of love letter , but those forget that they need much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he is planning , told he continued to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent . &quot;
&quot; thus the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and have a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history into a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters have been collected in the context of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Columbus , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I have never imagined that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were passed on 19 March at one of the UN warehouse in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled in the camp to transfer the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC sat down as they had done before to take the prec@@ epts of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ epts , but letters of sub@@ sist@@ ence of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all participants . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; told the policy expedition Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we passed the letters , a former fighters led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a type of cabin , in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ cher , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I had fear that hin@@ ders , because besides him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ elle , a deadly weapon in the Dorn@@ bus@@ h@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; I said to him nevertheless , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; I answered a letter that someone has written me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so nice , so I answered on it . I suddenly walked the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I im@@ pover@@ ished him very firmly and sat down beside the gran@@ at@@ amps .
&quot; maybe he was p@@ ity , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this struggles , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . the F@@ ARC , was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the hunger strike . &quot; I have never imagined that someone would forgive me for my fault . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside , which is waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; finally , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were led to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in hiding .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; &quot; many years we have experienced how social injustice comes from the state to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the company in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this size order it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed by :
&quot; to hear these people who have never had heard of hearing and had no choice , and to realize that people who often have seen as monsters and even hate , that were caused by their living conditions and the environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it comfort@@ ed me that all people - even those who killed and so much damage to us , and can give us a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ers was proph@@ esi@@ ed that after the de@@ ar@@ ming Peace would rule peace .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as it gives inequality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will be people who are willing to attack the weapons and to protest to their rights . and that is completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all that dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victim , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be imp@@ lied . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; it follows the translation of an article that was written by uns@@ rem partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ su@@ mo@@ wa , and its original release on the website OC Media took place . &quot;
&quot; hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
with terror activists have experienced the coverage of the last few months on the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat , which depends on the case of a D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ an over the dor@@ sal LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not just over night . &quot;
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of their experiences with us and talked to us about what happened in the republic .
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , after several months ago , the international head@@ lines were released , after reports have been published , the hau@@ ling , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic of them@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspected of que@@ ens and put them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew there . &quot;
&quot; for her childhood , she had noticed that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was created , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced by the gender equality of her land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; from fear to their lives , they moved to the USA in the end . &quot;
Sabrina : I was active as an hon@@ orary assistant at a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ ac@@ ine that put in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; as I tried to help her , someone made of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his che@@ et@@ ous friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the pictures from my documents made all the round of the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
&quot; on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was just about getting a couple of shopping from the back of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned myself , I feel something in my body , but I did not hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time in the Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you still want to worship the family , du Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost awareness and wo@@ ke up in the hospital again in the hospital .
apparently some women had gotten everything and begin to cry out .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambulance .
in the hospital I was driving that I had two sampling in my right lung .
OC Media : in which clinic you have placed - in the men or women of the women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ unken , but the doctor stood and laid me on women . &quot;
I am very grateful for that .
&quot; when I was reading his name for the first time at his office , I got it to do with fear ; it was a Muslim @-@ mix@@ er name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he is respectful to me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got dr@@ ones .
&quot; they ri@@ ef@@ ly me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; the required to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that everything was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they asked absur@@ de claims : some said to me , I must prove it , in the official TV in Gros@@ ny , and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just Schl@@ ech@@ ed@@ de , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have Kör@@ b@@ chen@@ Size C - what could I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older people spoke once my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that has not only damaged your family but the whole Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she placed a cor@@ ck around the neck .
luckily the neighbours came and saved them .
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , a car with a pan@@ elled window wash@@ ers and a number plate with a 95 dr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; after the third time it happened , me was clear that there was something lazy . &quot;
my peop@@ le@@ der @-@ friends over@@ insp@@ ected the numer@@ ical signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you save ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to give their name well , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the land , but then it happened something im@@ credi@@ ble . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without sign up without notice , without any case , without anything . &quot;
&quot; I broke my old SI@@ M card , and cast them into the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
came to and chec@@ s in the hotel .
the number was registered to a foreig@@ ner .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you would be sure , just because you have left the land ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which hotel you do . you even know your m@@ ould number . &quot;
just to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my f@@ ame number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender balance , however , that is a t@@ abo@@ an issue . &quot;
some traditionally c@@ asi@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements I am still running in me .
&quot; so much I wish , this se@@ el@@ ic barrier I cannot overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always tell that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with a camera , I actually give myself trouble , like the person to watch out of their past - thus to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed dor@@ m ? &quot;
Sabrina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; I spoke with someone , who has sent one and a half months in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ adan no human beings were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not closed a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite relatives , these are taking care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced through blood Gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ tion . &quot;
OC Media : are there still gay men det@@ ained in this secrecy ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says there was not very many .
&quot; if , then especially those who have no rich relative or which were dropped from their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are being held there , so that they can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be converted , you will show their bodies on TV and claim they could have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , but specifically targeted to radi@@ ating themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this now only a mut@@ ing or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just have someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after her beard was grown .
there was nothing new since then .
they simply have taken them .
&quot; and this so called Lord , this person was even better than these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as a band@@ its , but there have been no reports for so far . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people , who took up a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always contributed my hair to her .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I believe , already before 2003 I was already known to Gros@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , back then it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to lead us to the &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; but ultimately brought us back to the St@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were frozen ; I had colored eyelashes , contributed Tu@@ be@@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops . &quot;
the security of the Sch@@ aria has never bent me only a hair .
&quot; before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like I met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and all the city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been instruc@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otte do not say about the un@@ happiness in another . &quot;
it often says to children if those who are about sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , they are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
they have never sinn@@ ed me , never h@@ unted and never thre@@ w . &quot;
OC Media : how long held this Gn@@ at ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak on mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he did not spoke about us , but above the behaviour of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel like the people in the city started to change .
&quot; who had previously been sm@@ iled and sm@@ iled , consider you at one time with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic was constantly mer@@ ged . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you think now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I did not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ ups , interaction , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get f@@ inger@@ ings . &quot;
I have no cent for it for a long time .
I have discovered these people myself when I h@@ ap@@ hi@@ pped shelter .
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : enter an Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ bern .
&quot; so is nature , that has no means to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to know you with foam before the mouth , that there are no gay people in them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ an@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ar@@ din@@ er have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet , there is it - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , that &apos;s why it is unpleasant for me to hear what to hear . &quot;
I have been here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
&quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , going into the mosque , and during Ram@@ adan , live with men together . &quot;
&quot; you know , many think about transi@@ tional identity to men who love men , and they believe that man changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a trust@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise , different ways of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I will be here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not very sad at all - I simply know that I am myself .
local groups war@@ n a rise in self @-@ mor@@ pers within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty @-@ rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the last few months there has been a strong rise of self @-@ mor@@ nings . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August back the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , in the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the South@@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he che@@ ered for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness that can pay in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a video shared on YouTube shared video held the moments , after having finished himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the comb@@ us@@ tion were so strong that doctors have nothing to do . &quot;
he died short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ ic@@ ide that took place in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists before , that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : there were all family members who were hel@@ pl@@ ess and able because of the persecution on the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and to work safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a major part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community is located , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis which makes it hard to uph@@ old the local Arab population to keep its livel@@ i@@ hoods . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy took power over and 1925 great efforts to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran ahead of oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most common and valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly and the native population gets only little of that wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and emp@@ tin@@ ess . &quot;
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arabs systematic jobs in the local oil - gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
&quot; the government has also built a variety of com@@ bs , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the Provin@@ ces are Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;
these com@@ bs have only led to merge the devast@@ ation caused in the region through dr@@ y@@ ness and destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm @-@ trees industry .
unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth now rose to 81 % .

systematic strategy ... which aims to dismis@@ s the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of &apos; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; tall increase &quot; in the number of self @-@ mor@@ ality among young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
&quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said , particularly the unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z newly an@@ coming ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot;
&quot; as functional and institutions preferred not to susp@@ end Arab labour , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi wants to have access to work possibilities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods outside their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their advantages and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi , and so an@@ ked , as the Arabic names am not toler@@ ated in the workplace , because the Spe@@ aking of the Arabic language or the wearing Arabic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances which must end@@ ure the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi , the human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for su@@ ic@@ ide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ ic@@ ide is avoidable .

&quot; the following article is a revised version of the opinion , which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , do not respond to many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ se@@ perate femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even thought well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all the femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , in spite of equal education women still earn less money than men . &quot;
&quot; that women are still under strict observation , when it comes to what they can do with their body . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women occur sooner or later in various areas of life to a gl@@ utt@@ ony ceiling , and that discrimination based on sex are still moving across the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all of this is aware of me and well @-@ known .
I am convinced of it and I am twice and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , if I talk to skin colour , racism , on black CIS women , on black transi@@ tional women , on black women in the LGB@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ pora , when I mention , on which kind we have physically , se@@ el@@ ic , and verbal abuse , decide to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ tw@@ ist femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - come together to stand &quot; their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &apos;s to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alized violence , an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motiv@@ ated violence that we are exposed to black women on two @-@ fold species . &quot;
&quot; or , that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin of origin earn less than white men and women . &quot;
that black girl and girls are directed with a migration background of the school as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres , and women with an immig@@ rant background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want that all women , all men and at all men have all the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot tap into the white woman , in whose centre the white woman stands , which refuse to take into account both the gender and the skin colour of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and no longer will fight for my membership in a white @-@ fem@@ istic @-@ oriented sphere , which always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner def@@ endant in 18@@ 51 in their speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a humane and margin@@ alized nature . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ing group@@ ings , which also absor@@ bing our customs and customs , in order to drive their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to put the white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin color and sex . for some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women attempt to honor them for a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different her@@ os to the home , and down from white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I get rid of it before me to release me completely from the femin@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist Paradig@@ m , which is so stub@@ born , that inter@@ c@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; it is more important than ever before , that we define black women after our own ideas and set us into the spheres , which are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ em , author &apos;s author &apos;s book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : how we can defend ourselves in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ se@@ perate femin@@ ists are immediately calling separ@@ atism and exclusion , after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , by which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a bl@@ ur@@ red environment I can grasp black women and women of other cultures than it existed in this paradi@@ gm anymore .
I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradi@@ gm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither over@@ seen nor ignored , nor ignored . &quot;
&quot; p@@ ly against the pollution : the mission of a man , to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations . &quot;
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine who reports the special about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern due to the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of contamination on his church . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river which we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dy@@ mium , the pollution and the un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - an affiliate of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a sums up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; if we had no water any more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq based documentary fil@@ mer@@ in and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , filmed and edited . &quot;
&quot; the focus of their work is on the followed , little str@@ ated sub@@ cultures and is characterized by using co@@ oper@@ atively vide@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with their help oppressed communities to tell their stories in their way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult struggle against violence

&quot; the following article is the shorten@@ ed and processed version of the article &quot; &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of cur@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # devi@@ ations ) , which reports on the certain@@ ties to women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to the protection of affected people .
&quot; a police com@@ miss@@ ary said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship was a little time passed and the police said , their statement would be laid down , but more could not be done . &quot;
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for distr@@ action so useful also the ak@@ fully display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez nothing .
a few days later the second woman moved her ad back .
breaking the devil of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women are to be paid at all , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also dependent on the men that they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence to be victims of violence at all . &quot;
&quot; inhal@@ er 1 blo@@ ws and Statisti@@ ken@@ 2 Inv@@ isible Mis@@ sions and a judicial system that nothing sub@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of execution and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really abuse , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , research for gen@@ der@@ ings at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social @-@ scientific research facility in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are different fields and reports but not even to show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the figures available are alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , we went to the District Court of 9@@ 600 showing for domestic violence in 2015 . at 70 % of it , there was violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there was more than 5000 indicators of domestic violence in peace courts . here there were 86 % of the ads .
&quot; in the ads were 40 % of the women , that they were physically ground@@ ed , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; on every woman who will be re@@ funded in Paraguay because of mental missions , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on any woman who will be re@@ funded due to physical failure , come two women who do not do this , they explained it to the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as women &apos;s genocide in Paraguay have not been an own crime , the criminal law cannot be adequately documented how many women are mur@@ dered each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; in August 2016 , journalists were at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ ic@@ ide in the country . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay have at least 37 cases where women were killed by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violence through men . &quot;

invisible missions and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name for all their former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then after . this should always be ber@@ eu@@ en . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together . but two years she en@@ du@@ red the psych@@ ic violence in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women , while at the same time recognis@@ able the he@@ avi@@ est : &quot;
I have never imagined that I would be victims of failure .
&quot; when I read earlier about it , I always thought that the only women happened to be mis@@ led because they dec@@ eive of violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report on the missions through Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , it wrote posts on Facebook where they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever had the hand against them and refuse to conf@@ ess that his behaviour was also a form of failure . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and left him before . &quot;
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of ab@@ uses at least have at least a certain compli@@ city on it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner began . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I think &quot; ) that consists of women all in any way victims of failure .
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other . &quot;
you do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case all began working with psych@@ ic abuse .
&quot; her prosp@@ erous partner , eventually managed to convince them that it was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he started to beat her .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads , with the authorities remained without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she conducted a trial against its former partners who developed into an in@@ scr@@ utable legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly for money , power and influence of their former partners . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach to def@@ ective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but are not being used . &quot;
&quot; the display of ab@@ uses is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees large problems with the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill introduced in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Für@@ th ) . &quot;
this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ One ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
&quot; the original design of the law considers to explain and be tough@@ er to a stand@@ alone crime , and to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; thus the leg@@ est@@ ext was altered in some points to also win the members for the law , the feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tion would be banned , which is currently banned in Paraguay , and can be pun@@ ished with up to five years . &quot;
&quot; the original bill introduced , the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which have to present the victims of violence at present themselves , if they just want to report , and want to preserve a safe place to place the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law does not effectively be effective if the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure does not have sufficient financial resources to make it available :
in Paraguay is not seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; here a re@@ viewer must take place , so that violence is no longer considered to be something normal . &quot;
&quot; in view of these facts , the perpet@@ rators are inno@@ cent and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
we must report such a long indication that is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously parts of the law were changed , however , inter alia was a passage yesterday , which called for the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about changes are going apart .
the section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack its victims .
&quot; the string of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great retreat . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man continued to ban an attack after a newspaper in O@@ man
&quot; this website was locked because of a decision of the information Ministry , &quot; is locked on the homepage of the published newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than a year ago the om@@ an@@ ical authorities have joined the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an .
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he built a one @-@ year @-@ old prison . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ al Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to justice , but they came again free . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man was ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had set his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state of state . &quot;
&quot; since then , he died , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the main minist@@ ries in the country : Prime Minister , Secretary of Defense , Secretary of Foreign Minister , Secretary of Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister , Secretary of the Supreme Council for the planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the sult@@ an is marked by the persistent effort of security forces , especially of domestic intelligence , including freedom of press , including freedom of press , including freedom of press , blog@@ gers and other activists , to in@@ timi@@ date and det@@ ention . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit the peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights , including activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country like corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Chief Editor was published on 26 July 2016 , after the title &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; &quot; was published in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officers in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officers was accused , judges of the Supreme Court of O@@ man to put pressure on pressure to raise a judgment in an inheritance . &quot;
&quot; issue of the paper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 , with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ level parties bind hands of the judiciary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial committee , was charged by the ISS before the special department and was arrested upon his arrival by the security guards . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS awarded the dep@@ uty chief editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j which was named after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as Chief Editor .
&quot; the paper was closed down at a certain time after the information Minister had given the instruction , that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , before the court in Mas@@ kat took place the first trial in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court condemned the three journalists to Pr@@ ison and ord@@ ained the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned both among other things because of dis@@ ruption of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of injury to a pro@@ hibition and emp@@ t@@ ying .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j have been sentenced to three years of prison and money pen@@ alties in the amount of 3000 om@@ an@@ an Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year career provided against the two journalists . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a money sentence in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollar ) , after using the use of a information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a deposit was fixed in the amount of 5000 om@@ an@@ an Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollar ) and he was already released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of judgment . &quot;
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court talked to Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i to six months of prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after the dec@@ eler@@ ation of his sixth sentence in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he built his one @-@ year @-@ old prison . &quot;
the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Education to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper still sees itself as an attack by the om@@ anic government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January the information Minister made a statement , which was extended by the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information sm@@ in@@ Minister signed a further assignment in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and thus the Minister proved to be another time against the decision of the appeal of the decision to send the release of the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; the lasting closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in O@@ man , the freedom of the press was in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; for example , to further injuries include the closing of the site of independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to make their operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an@@ ical authorities are still not ready to prepare the extensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Golf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ an@@ an authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and uncondi@@ tionally release ;
2 . a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n to create their journalists in their work ;
to protect the press of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in O@@ man can exercise their right@@ ful human rights work un@@ ambig@@ uous and without fear of compensation , including judicial ships . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , Illu@@ stration is done by its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in media . it is a growing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of healthcare and vaccines that make special medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have widespread effects in the poorest countries as elsewhere , and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is carried out by African scientists , in building own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the Center for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic has had the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself decided on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to assist the sam@@ b@@ ish health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ er discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ er speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ische national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with lab tests .
&quot; in addition , I just have a research programme for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think is the important current knowledge of knowledge in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there is no basic research here . we only apply solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers , instead of being M@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get are often not good in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs much money , continuous supply with electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the public opinion of science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; R@@ W : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus , and how can we support development ? &quot;
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for specific scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of Life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; R@@ W : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the start@@ up access to scientific expertise , which represent here challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
&quot; from the United States to India : &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seeds will change global food production &quot;
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine who reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ den , the first plant that grown by NASA A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space and consumed . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ tons of work was just driven by its own accident and the question how many sal@@ ads may get , limits . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that ever more sal@@ ads were pat@@ ented and that he could not use it further for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents not only apply for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cro@@ wning leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ on locations . due to these trends , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as the passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition , Mor@@ ton still sal@@ ads , he needs to do so much longer as his work is continually increasing by ever more limitations . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if there is a rock bread in a river that I have to walk around . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breed tradition , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go on sal@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand in court , no one can breed any new sal@@ ads , because all of the features are already patented . so he is doing so good as possible and tries to bri@@ ghten those characteristics that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ or to use any material that is being protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International space station ISS have red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ geous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eating . there will be tested whether plants are grown in space .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name is rather like the movement from the IT field , rather than from the field of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; seeds can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ right@@ ed software . &quot;
&quot; it was called to life to ensure that some plant species and gene is not protected as intellectual property , and thus are usable for plant bree@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the initiative , in short Os@@ si , U.S. bree@@ ders can commit to use other seeds free of them . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders simply allow others to breed their seed , to breed their own varieties and not immediately utter@@ ed - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plants . &quot;
doz@@ ens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
whis@@ per@@ ing views
&quot; for the em@@ ental professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si directors , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the opportunity to grow new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed plays to him according to a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try , latter isn &apos;t or only little to exploit by seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not busy with GM plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables , cor@@ n , gene@@ tically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we also need to know how it is being offered on farms in August and September 2016 , it should also know that the way that this vegetables is bred . &quot;
dietary pol@@ arity without seed inj@@ uri@@ ity is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative will undertake to make others their seeds free to make available , so that you approach it as opposed to the seed , seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; Os@@ si @-@ supporters argu@@ ed that the future of food supplies is threatened , since the available genital pool due to the increasing intellectual property rights based on plant material , which is thus always limited , un@@ folding . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all cart@@ on characteristics is protected as intellectual property , which makes it usable for plant bree@@ ders either at all or not . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ built plants like wheat in even bigger style are patented as salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are so excited that they have targeted characteristics - from such , by which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they stick to certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders are more and more patents ab@@ uses . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions are far worse by climate change .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaker Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to that genetic diversity is important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos &apos;s activities . with a total of four genital banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Economic Affairs of the United States . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that the intellectual property restri@@ cts other bree@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ eting innovations promote . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is exp@@ ired . &quot;
often these instructions can help others with another method of the same result .
&quot; such protection are not inhi@@ bited innovation , but supports them by providing the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton looks different : 20 years waiting to wait until a patent turns , it certainly has no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you are waiting for so long to wait for plants , which are adapted to plants that have already been adjusted to the changed environmental conditions . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ oton@@ ous incentives for us are not attractive . &quot;
we want farmers make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mor@@ ton is disturbed to pat@@ ently in the concept of self @-@ characteristics , &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants consist of themselves and as bree@@ ders , we finally have no idea how the plants do that . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , Plant @-@ inti@@ mid@@ ation in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who bred a sor@@ ting , also bred his own values into them . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ al believes in their cultivation of mass @-@ wise her@@ bic@@ ide , bred in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is precise . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , it will be able to survive the most smaller seeds - either refuse it or do it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the prevention of plant @-@ pat@@ ently innovative would : &quot; it looks like me with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I need to constantly use new material for my catalogue since I know that my competitors sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent you are for 20 years before competition , which makes it very nice to make it very nice . &quot;
&quot; although the U.S. seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept itself rapidly spread throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; plant breeding program , working with farmers and helps them to grow new varieties . &quot;
&quot; it also supports it to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed seed , and sell their own . &quot;
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of Os@@ si commitment to bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding is different from country to country , why Os@@ si is not easy to transfer one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able against the current practice of the European Pat@@ ent@@ am@@ ts , which permits patents on conventional plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent to this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ plant breeding systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seeds , NGOs and plant breeding companies all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; plant breeding movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems , that the organisation is currently under global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official kick @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid group US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of eating - an association of aid organizations such as the w@@ k Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published that farmers can have the opportunity to improve seed and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; in the report also stresses the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by von Os@@ si that will soon see him more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has focused mainly on where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to understand the people that even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still bul@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government documents the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents the human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it cri@@ tici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true - despite this attack and the potential of defending the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , so it has never been so important to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important to overcome these goals , so it was never as important to overcome the block and not admit . we insist on to fulfil our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first zen@@ ed website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , following the authorities more than two months of 21 web sites , such as b@@ ending the independent news of MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking issue of Al J@@ aze@@ era due to the alleged &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no access to the blog of the Colom@@ bian and human rights research scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissem@@ ination of colum@@ ni@@ es and articles that he does not write accessible websites and media in Egypt .
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to deal with the cement apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blog@@ ger , the provider at which also Zi@@ adas blog is native , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security forces , while he was reported on the Stud@@ enten@@ werk and took a video how the police exercis@@ ed physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article are mainly concerned about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada turned to the block through the government and reflected what this means to him : &quot;
&quot; the , blogs are very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the block@@ age of the blogs may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a relief effort , a attempted murder , un@@ loading of the national Security Council , the blocking of blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I was not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of items to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; however , after having locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave one go the way up to an end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ei@@ ving and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , the Egyptian authorities of the 24th May to 06@@ th of August 133 sites . this is used technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of vendors , through the use of intern@@ es@@ en@@ sur and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( VP@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 June we noticed how the blocking of web pages , the VP@@ N@@ s , began . &quot;
such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block content and fil@@ tering that may have access to Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation is in addition mer@@ ged that the cent@@ ur@@ ings decisions are made behind closed doors , giving the Egyptian population no legal basis with which they can proceed to justice against these actions . &quot;
&quot; now the question is , how far is the Egyptian government willing to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it be next to attack ? &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are deb@@ ated .

&quot; day for day , newspapers in all Brazil with glo@@ wing head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and the home of numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school shot , &quot; &quot; every second day is mur@@ dered a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe rau@@ lt disp@@ ens@@ ary with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense situation the greenhouse 2017 achieved in Rio the highest stand for 10 years .
the Brazilian government of Global Justice also called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
&quot; reports like these are everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 , at least the manager of a local paper . &quot;
&quot; the article published for detailed reporting of violence in Rio well @-@ known newspaper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; on 16 August the editorial article &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report about crimes that occur in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sex delay , etc . Every@@ thing , however , is published in the heading &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not conclude our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war of war in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video a journalist of the newspaper , that there is according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , which are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
in the editorial article the newspaper continues to write :
&quot; we are aware that a war course is to be distor@@ ted , even if it is distor@@ ted , atro@@ cities in the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; more than they util@@ ised ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil argu@@ ed the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , in contrast to account the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - like extra in the analysis of military revenues in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education , and a historical and self @-@ paying negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember : the State of Rio de Janeiro , is greater than just his capital . &quot;

&quot; Rio de Janeiro , to call the &quot; &quot; violent place in Brazil &quot; , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is false : &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent data available . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the federal state Rio de Janeiro .

&quot; in addition , the company has been part of the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , such as Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state . &quot;
&quot; these measures also belonged to the foundation of U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to conquer a massive police force an Fav@@ ela and a unit permanently . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning this was actually led to a decrease of rap@@ es@@ y deaths . for several years , U@@ PP , however , after several reports about Schi@@ kan@@ en and repres@@ sions against the poor commun@@ es , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under attack . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his article from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio did not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this ur@@ ges the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war . this includes the penetration into the territory of an &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civil is an im@@ pi@@ ous point in the countryside and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; du@@ mb@@ ing balls &quot; . &quot; &quot;

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Sy@@ rer learn to plant mushrooms
screens@@ hot from the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization p@@ ax and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Sur@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of Bel@@ ag@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; particularly strongly affected by the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21st 2013 called Hunder@@ ter civilians on 21 August 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of the UN and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre of Assad regime has been practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , they have been controlled by rebels controlled areas outside of Damascus under si@@ ege , which led people to rely on local or through tunn@@ els and check@@ points . &quot;
&quot; through years of long block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a return , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Gh@@ out@@ as as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the conventional in Syria in Syria and are very rare partly of the Syrian cuisine . your nutritional power makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
&quot; the direc@@ ting of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided for cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in homes and cellars . &quot;

&quot; forty @-@ two people died , and about 70 were wo@@ unded as a result of the forest fires of the 15th and 16th of October . this led the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state flight . &quot;
fires were also registered in the G@@ ali@@ zi@@ en region where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 cre@@ arri@@ es , which grew up in the northern and central regions of the country , and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached . &quot;
&quot; in June , at Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande is a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and over 200 wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European construction surveillance system , which monitors the forest @-@ surfaces by satellite recording , are burned in Portugal for approximately 500,000 hectares of forest in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon Region . &quot;

the predic@@ table tragedy
the aim of protests from Saturday was the call for better predic@@ tive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil@@ isation was unable to d@@ ash the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
João So@@ ver@@ al by the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão the streets and villages were evac@@ u@@ ated for everything and nothing .
&quot; this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are frag@@ ment reports of open streets , which were enclosed by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria could have had a similar tragedy like in June , since the streets were very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building measures will be questioned in the area of high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a broad proposal to the Wal@@ dre@@ ad@@ form , which the government had brought into serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was emerging from the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a Lock@@ thorn of the law , which had the responsibility of the case , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - this was an open but@@ cher , so that all could be built , João Sor@@ val leads in the same article on the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made attention to that large areas with Eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees from slightly fl@@ amm@@ able wood , located like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of civil defence of Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October , as inhabitants sought or tried to contact persons , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that served the population with information : they used your own civilian data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched by the developers of João P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was reported on this fat@@ eful weekend in October , so that the server followed the rush of 400,000 users , not with@@ ered , this site was more than half a million draw@@ backs . &quot;

&quot; during a night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years previously , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which had defeated short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan was to a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; precisely at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , which belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Asia , for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother said it at that time , she knew she would not see her son a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the morning the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the keys .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari the leader of the Hez@@ ara @-@ e @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ ah was just mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly .
the Taliban on the Haz@@ ara known Taliban arrived ever closer .
&quot; many Haz@@ ara passed the land in direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his run , A@@ shar@@ af took place in Pakistan again . &quot;
for a couple of years he worked in a coher@@ ence . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left from its low wages , and went into Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and to@@ wed sa@@ ws with mort@@ ar , the harder than he himself to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods . &quot;
&quot; at that time as today , life af@@ gh@@ anic refugees in Iran was shaped by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , rec@@ alled A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there was no services provided there and no heating . we handed n@@ ylon in front of the open windows that we do not finish night at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life beyond Pap@@ ers in Iran and made them ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ and@@ ed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was ash@@ amed homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who shared twice a day meal in the most vulnerable . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high quality quot@@ as is a sort of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions , the asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suff@@ ers under a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special performance centres . &quot; this is impro@@ vised , in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be dealt with an insur@@ rection when they officially added a request for asylum - which can still be drawn after the registration of the asylum @-@ year . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for an accommodation , rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the streets . &quot;
so it is also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; but his miserable lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ af , to free themselves from these conditions soon . &quot;
&quot; after spending several years of working in the construction , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he had a second hostel after a while and a snor@@ k@@ ish .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now theme of the documentary &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; behind ven@@ bi@@ an@@ ical luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min W@@ ah@@ id@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the film won the Venice City Award , the 2017 was already awarded for the 24th time . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries .
&quot; some of the Afgh@@ ans have emerged some of the Afgh@@ ans , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff largely have refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant is told by the various af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets are far enough beyond the Italian food addi@@ ction and the retail trade and aim to go back to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my country , and I cannot live happily when I know that my people suffer . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces in the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as anyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af for@@ ged plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; this way , they can sell their harvest for the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stand stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has done this journey itself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .
Ne@@ ti@@ zen Report : legislative ab@@ outs from Egypt allow ab@@ outs social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen &apos;s report is an international snap@@ shot that shows challenges , victories and upcoming trends in worldwide Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a legislative power , which is what users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook , only after registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; the user would have to take advantage of the social networks , within six months after the deadline you register on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as its detection number . &quot;
who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the execution of a criminal rede@@ mption .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty members of the members of the Parliament , lies with the legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament , and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; May rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed a further member of parliament a bill of law , in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the removal of the president or a high officials would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; under the Egyptian right the relief of the president as well as state institutions are already pun@@ is@@ hable . under the law there would be such action , however , with pris@@ ons and money pen@@ alties , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be adopted , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 , when he exercis@@ ed authority against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup , who fought against military coup , who had fought against the military removal of the elected President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited for the same time as more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested in prison for four years in cust@@ ody for the most four years . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on the 20th of May , because the pris@@ es@@ cop@@ ing according to human rights groups began to bring the accused of prison in the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty to the death penalty , so many human rights groups agree , the stress load of e.g. weapon ownership , illeg@@ ally assembly , murder and trying murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iza was calling for two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage on pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which were also arrested in the previously mentioned occurrence , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activists lost to cl@@ ums@@ y documents
May we spent Tunisi@@ an authorities six hours with the trial of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been advoc@@ ated by the President of the Republic , the according to the plan expressly provided a controversial draft law , the busin@@ ess@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused Offic@@ ers Am@@ nest@@ y provided that these all un@@ law@@ ful funds will be returned . &quot;
&quot; that published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at published document , thro@@ ws a light on how the pre@@ di@@ als plans to support the legal situation . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the disclosure of its sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press @-@ dex@@ tr@@ es which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 . May as a witness . &quot;
wants China to force the users of social media to present their credit card ?
&quot; according to new rules of the Information Office of the Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before sending messages to social media or share them . &quot;
&quot; in the regulations , the registration with the full real name will be required . &quot;
analy@@ st susp@@ ect that the elimination of anonymous comments can be reached within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ective in order to protect citizens &apos; journ@@ alism and its independence .
see you then in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
May the official c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia put an access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ chat , involved in the state government as the &quot; Organiz@@ er of the Information spread &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government can organise a list of online services , which allows the &quot; publication of the information &quot; . &quot; the law allows the government to be responsible for removal of content and to force them on request for the removal of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently sites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ p@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .ru and frag@@ ments of other services . &quot;

&quot; a tur@@ qu@@ oise court had the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administr@@ ators themselves so@@ wn , two English @-@ speaking articles , the information that Turkey support the jiha@@ dists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication gave us , the site was locked because of a information source , working with groups in order to reinforce a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey has been fully blocked the website . it is therefore , next to China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain can not stop running .
&quot; following this week , the government of Britain is in the midst of targeted consultation with regard to increased monitoring measures , the Internet services providers would force the communications services in real time to monitor and back@@ door programs to de@@ code the data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has established telecommunications companies and intelligence services relating to the proposal , however , has other technology companies and the civilian population . &quot;
&quot; despite all the consultation , the consultation will still run until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
