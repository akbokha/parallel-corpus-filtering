<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, American authors have been read and operated by American authors."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporous conspiracy of a oil magnates, who were covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura-Stud, which were the most supreme Bundescourt with judges, who were interested to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," I was as if that is absolute truth, it is anything that I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the USA."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting, that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very blackish love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he goes with his bottleneck.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops with his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague expressed it, and declared publicly his contempt for Muslims, latinos, AfroAmericans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people react to his statements and voted in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won at the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number that ever reached by the party nomination candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans, who support these bigotto person, I asked me?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to get Trump and his voters don't get into line with people during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist, the director of journalism programme, the people from all over the world, a deep unbelieving person, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Trumps worldview did not agree with the Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix "." "</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr that fights their lives long, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she also fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped with a lot of patience and grace, and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then, there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values they embodied through them in deep my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"during the Trump of his way to the nomination Republican presidential data, they offered me a grip and the counterpart of his restricted vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the argument with the idea that people voted for Trump because they had either their racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlooked these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair the Trump-voters as rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange the people, one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an incapacity to understand those who act in another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters have voted for Trump because they would like to regain control over a country that has disappointed it?</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might perhaps say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt on those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" (Anm.).: so much like "" elongation of the White against all other ethnicities "; word game of white in striving to the whites and whiclash, which means as much as sleudertrauma), as it was the big Van Jones, that has done exactly what America did so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have, America is always welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country is elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise, saying: to Hell with versatility, religious freedom and the entire concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the ruin, say they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation for Hillary Clinton had Mr. Khan had a wording with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>

<seg id="51">"no!" "brood the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" replied, "</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" riefen her and her voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone who does not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a vote and "strong" NEIN "!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" God is thanks, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps land, told the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>

<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was then known that this ship was already operated in liberated waters of illegal fishing, before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were therefore raised and little inclined, welcome a Legislation of this kind at its shores."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised himself swiftly against the ship. they refuse to place one of their harbours, and refuse to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursudden was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply deny everything "," remembers Benedict Kiilu, a leitner of the Kenyan fisherman. he is part of a team that discovered and followed by ship. "</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch them down there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, due to looting the fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"besides Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that the Prime Minister had been expelled from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded people and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is captured is hidden because of it is extremely difficult to recharge. therewith is the illegal fishing is a leading cause of the overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"by intentional contempt of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can hurt that a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however, while actions against illegal fishing once were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail, the actions occur today in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platforms."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists, news, digested activities or details that can be noticed during a port-spection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move along the open lake, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to characterize the authorities, ships that fish in wasted areas. also, so suspicious way to discover that a ship invites its prisoners on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations may show whether the ships involved have a fishing license where they were on the way and perhaps even if they have a criminal register."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries which are against illegal fishing, can refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports on the basis of this information. and that they might not be forced to sell their cargo. and that they might be forced to pay for numbers, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing activity will not pay more financially."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, director director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the aforementioned platform was created to win estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which lose eight members of the network at HISH-i every year due to the illegal fishermen that penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East-Africa has one of the most productive-fish species, present for the region of commercial fishing, from all over the world. among these even those illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"these actions include actions such as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licensing, indication of phantasies, the fish protected species and the fish in nature conservation."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-consistent control system. "," says Long. "" earlier a ship could not go illegally and a country could say 'you do not walk my port. "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say "Komm to me". "and precisely this legal slaughter was trying to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has revealed criminal networks, the fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships who used several fraudulic identities and it has been tracked ships and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with Interpol, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us fairly far into the networks of organised crime, "" says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system that should help FISH-i, digested ships precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed further, also helps to recharge the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships will turn off their automatic indentification systems, which they can no longer be used by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps build a system that connects different information levels with each other. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations do indeed influence the unquestionable global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently Skyteam has recently opened the platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the maritime organization Oceana, a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed through the position of every single traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join forces with neighbours to get a better picture of who what is doing - that is simply sense," "says it." "here is a chance for countries to combine themselves and to bundle their resources for the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run, where a global system allows persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals, but also scesses."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that used earlier without a license and can hardly be reckoned with consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participating countries meanwhile have a 33% increase in fishing sales, since then fishing boats more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after the ISH-i Somalia had assisted Greko 1, Greko 1 found the inspectors there on board the hauling network whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strongly that we can now copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study objective over several hundred million dollars through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries joined together, so called West Africa Task Force. also, they are fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "with safety, the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions," says Copeland. "</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's younger member countries began to report on his first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship which was on the wrong flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used prefers used by now."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated in botany waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the take of measures against Greko 1 set out a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is a further success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a particular, collaborative effort to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world sea.

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to overuse two important features: passive knowledge, to understand the initial text and to transfer active language skills to address it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case in native language. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the native language - native language."</seg>

<seg id="382">"some companies who do not have foreign employees, allow translation nonetheless firing internally. then the Japanese employees, whose English knowledge is done to be the best, made to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worrted and enigous movements created by machine translation, show that this technique can not replace a long way of human translators. this applies to some languages quite well."</seg>

<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the creation of stories in their original language is a possible response to it."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not on the written one, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of major cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already performed for 2015 events, the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not pass on to the children born children."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project is:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided, if we create cities, the diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening is often associated with it, to understand" purposes these events instead "the listening to make to feel classy."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers show their story first in their own language and then explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and their representation is to make their audiences on it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions as if the language no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"for example, the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the storyteller Rassidatou are also taking the opportunity to explain for their country typical customs of narration."</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fake from the rabbits and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"having asked the meaning of his fabel, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language? "with a broad ridge, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"to date, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling in three cities have taken place and the organizers hope to organize this. all who are inspired by the project can get in touch with TLS, in order to organise their own storytellers."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a new examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, founded on 3 April 2017, various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration; the march started at the American Capitol, the government building of the capital, and ran until the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was named by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (civil Front for the re-examination of debts) and the eco-Arab church assembly in Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercessors of re-determination of debts also have submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the People of Puerto Ricos demands that politicians, bankers and government authorities, who are responsible for debts to be held responsible for their corrupt."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial examination and a committee committee without personal interests in public debt, with a firm, appropriate working conditions, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will press and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"the people of Puerto Ricos refused to pay a debt, which is not their."</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructure of state infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="1198">Why did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of time-wise convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The webdeveloper for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015 Bassel was born from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and Anchortin Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police Bassel "reported on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who mocked himself as an insider of the Assad's government, and put them aware of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">But his place of residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, Technologians and currently crossing the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes are looking forward to the work, which he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, the crossroads of numerous civilizations and merging Greek-Roman architecture with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"bassel could not yet know that ten years after having started with this work, the IS would put all of it, this architecture that embodied not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strip-suit into the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a period of time, which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"typically, bassel of this project has not yet been able to complete this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my whole life with it, of liberty to dream and bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English with me even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read English well, write and speak."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with each, who has asked. he has taught other incarnations to read and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">"Bassel has opened the door to technology. he taught me, both computer and smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet with me.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he has also brought up other prisoners, as they use computers, at least theoretically, without having in their hands they were in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a Prosaba, which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 her husband, when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for one year.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: because of corruption repression head after prison sentence back to previous post.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corrupt event in which a ruling member was returned to the workplace at the state apparatus in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is about Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in 2010 with four other defendants (approximately 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money domed from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose Council Cambaza is prevalent between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately asked its return to the company what happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the General Staff of the Republic, which exceeds the request, there would be no obstacles to refer to Cambaza to his old post, since the company was not a lack of disciplination after his confinement."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, too many inhabitants do not have the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Center for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, briefly CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to establish the director again:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption, and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a retreat with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should have a lack of discipline against the refutant.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company shook, however, and prompted no adequate legal steps to use the appropriate functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosambique social media, reject this behavior as well as regards the case as" "resist" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and that half of them did eat."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could maintain lectures and motivating talk, he could advise and his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but as he is incompetent, he has changed to be reintained in the company, which he helped to cause damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for its silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and Student of Political Science in Brazil, the director possessed no morality:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza rewarded by the state because he inanimate him I can not believe that someone has been rewarded in such a way that the state has already been so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza is missing the morality to return and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead it is only served by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as handcrafted to become an inexhaustible money source, and the state itself is tired, who was sentenced, and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"frankly, I do not know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves are in the prison of Samora Machel, the Mozambians will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, catchy, and - in other words - prophetic speakers."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral representations was to be energetic, that" a ambitious man was capable of everything, even the fatherland for its ambitions, its own individual interest to sell. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora said," "I don't know if a ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not that way. he changes the tactics, but it does not change from its ambitions."</seg>
<seg id="1280">A ambitious person is criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also distracting:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook is blocking the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burial word "Kalar PAE" means Kichererbse or Spage.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported "</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their assets from the network, because they unvoked the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East indian origin, or generally used as an adjective" "Indian". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censed the word" "Kalar" "or a man (in bursting writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the Hassan in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radicalal nationalistic movements has given the Word to an extremely valuable gonnation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is often used by Ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in the effort to fight a hate language in Myanmar, the company has ensored a lot of meaningful content on his platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar 'today likes to be associated with racism, but the word itself is not calling the hate speech automatically."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word, or have a doubt to express their use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burial words with basic different meanings which have the same character as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmesan also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters as' Kalar PAE '(Spage),' Kalar oat '(Kamel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooker Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">"a post of one of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends on the spiritual nature, whether they knew how he can hinder his back pain, as he did a word game."</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the Frageword (la) on Burmeso - resembles the racist expression very but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"in Win, it is the opinion that it will reduce the Hassan radicalal nationalists, but also that Facebook can be analytical, before there are all poes that divide into suspicion of racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Filtering the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you write on facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, the post office is carefully analysed and control it by checking the next words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example" Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar PAE "" (butterfly). "</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-legged nationalists are spreading the hate speech, a rather good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now it is time to circumcised its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all, the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of keywords often is a cross-catching and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply to begin to use a new word or alternative spelling of the canned word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung described, how Facebook started to clear his posts, when he only wanted to share his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to let my Facebook friends know that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and me, the Liken, posts and parts of content for 24 hours was prohibited because the post office has not met the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">"Facebook has a variety of posts of people, who have no negative intentions or which simply try to show their opinions against the Hassan radicalal nationalists."</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his Post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the mail, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country have bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmesan Internet community to ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to decrease racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words can be emmed only more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "chair" "or" "inheritance curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out, they didn't have made mistakes, they tried not to correct the falsehood."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only something more respect for the 15 million benefit they would have a large turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has taken care of a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users can now talk about Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the grid."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Posts, which have no hate speech, but nevertheless have been removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The bursting text reads "I want to sit on a chair and view pesencurry and watch an Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"just to check out whether Facebook removes the mail, which contains the word Kalar."</seg>

<seg id="1336">"over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks, the violence in the communes in Myanmar are in addition to heating, particularly in the area of Rakhine where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced to escape."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook has been for its failure, criticized hate speech on his burial sites under control."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of censor the word 'Kalar', it could have been better than focused on the context than on the code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1353">"but in the beginning of 2017, the draft law was decided against the children's before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which had been discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>

<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I am straight back home when I suddenly called Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my Father that on the bank of the Rapti river was a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">"immediately, I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes there."</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was and I immediately began to crush pictures!!"</seg>

<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" "I click for Conservation" "(lit.: I clides for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepalese and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was again published as part of a Content Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with great care to speak the name of their spouse or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say 'father of my child.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect they respect the husband's social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should be the norm disregarded this practice in life."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state Odisha by a hypocrisp, and rejected by her family and the village community after having raised a attached relative to names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition their wives also do not name in the name, is also common among men. however, they have far less access to fear, if not at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel, and housewives, a unique club, and were thus fast to the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"it is a place just for them alone, to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is committed to the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pahas been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to uncover practices, such as children's marriage up to the banishment of HIV- and AIDS Inner, and guides these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reported how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously have made an ambassination of the change at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion round, was of women who do not name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open a conversation about the patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"speaking to the name of their spouse is not loud, a burning is maintained and never posed to question."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not keep this, is considered to be back as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is deeply rooted in that we have never had thought about this discussion about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini had never named Rohini who had never called her husband to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband smashed a long time after the video was at an end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I can name him from now on with his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" "Patriarchate" "never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video project, the women tried to bring discussion with a practice in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, angry, sad, affectionate and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all the" "If we cannot tell the name of our spouses, but they can call us how they want, that they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her spouse over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the breakage of a centuries-old tradition, in the married women the name of her husband will never be able to speak. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she took her during the whole exercise only in front of her; a different decided to let the whole crammed frustration against him and his family by curse him away.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in adrenalin, having an ancient Brauch broke, the women decided that they would actually try home to name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas they put in his head: his wife could not stop his name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another cluba member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she warped, she got fear and said that there was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said, I was doing it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less comprehensible and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the galvanizing red point on the forehead, which shows the spouses:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the ziness-red spot if he also worked."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs and I listened to him to wear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped, but they mean, they are now in a better position, even to choose him in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip with each discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to make the women worry about who could hear what they hear," says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"during the last months they celebrated her own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives, they danced, and spoke about things that they never had thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, but I also have spoken about some things, for example as our identities to our spouses, have never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to tell certain things loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been carried only Saris in the group since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it is okay, but some wanted a salinity-curta, a wide shirt over a pants; they have not drunk."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes choice, morality connected to the Saris and much more, narrowing Rohini their own pair of curtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure that they will be able to create."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months have changed since their first discussion, Rohini confirmed that things slowly come into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then they listened to the name of their spouse."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it yet, but only when they are alone and have no other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now contribute to any time Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussionist know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the soleming of more freedom of movement or its own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. it will give a chain reaction if any woman goes home in the club and reported other people of it what we talk about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from excavated groups in India and make videos about stories about which is not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" news of those who experience them themselves, "and offer a hyperregional context in order to report on global human rights and development requirements."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may appear stupid as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International subsidiary of the Lawyers Association of the State of New York, the Ministers agreed that many people were criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"he sponsor, that Singapore should be considered as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>

<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Minister," to rotate logic to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, according to all our efforts and sacrifices, this valuable country, you hear that we are ultimately not a land."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had a breach of a flight before the responsibilities, a breach of breach."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, the country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons for Shanmugam's reasons were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one cannot measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of its, he appeared invariably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in contrast, he has defended the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York should be compared, equally cities that are permanently being led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old cores emerges from the authoritarian rulers, leaving the democrats, because they fit better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the final event that the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judicative, our political system really non-answers."</seg>

<seg id="1706">"when Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"shortly, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful when our werter K Shanmugam would take the trouble on himself to clear this point if he was highly paid to be part of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by clicking on the blog of his comment, he indicates that the critique of the conference should begin to understand the entire co-ordinance of the conference, in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the co-ordinance.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"he said that Singapore is rather a" city "than a country," explained why the elections in Singapore said so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He moved Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party over a decades?).</seg>

<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes correctly and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review defines the weakness of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "accepted a mistake" or was it a defiantly misspeaker?</seg>

<seg id="1721">"if not, in which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government of the government, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are of heavy importance."</seg>

<seg id="1730">This phrase seems to have annoyed many herbs...</seg>
<seg id="1731">"no one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We always had a city.</seg>

<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with cashing, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>

<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the majority of his time inside, he saddled to his screen, to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but what one can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine lips."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives at the top of his family house that had been living since 1967; the year, in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine where they had lived as felahyeen (e.g.: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for now six years Hdaib is a passionate activist who faced the conservative majority and asks her old well-proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapid music."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music that often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but also calls on the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics do not only find in his homeland, Amman Relevance, but also in cities that suffice from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by boundaries, and he can make fellow citizens with people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if it is not open to the US foreign policy, he defeated a special slope against the US American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, something that has been born with his identity as" Palestinian detacheter of the second generation "," even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine until now. "</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own living conditions, says Hdaib."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then it adds:" I think so, because I am a man, while he poured in water, while he poured out in water, it is the holy month of Ramadan; in that time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">"moreover, the law governing law is that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal."</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a senient hot Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the skid of hot coffee and the swelling of the Kent cigette in the nose is first and foremost characterised by freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you throws a look into the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do that basic things to do - as in the public during Ramadan water - to not end in jail."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior of Jordanian is an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila cancelled already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary groups that support the Islamic Action Front - the jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country is contradictory and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members and former press conference in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "straight" because of the sexual orientation of the scary.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many pretend to assert the commitment of the band in affairs like the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world whether more dangerous activism, which poses the ancient legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement called Mashrou'Leila the jordian people as" "progressive supporters of human rights" "that continues to work for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is likely to be not simply siletoric rhetoric, but in fact a deeper understanding of the crystalline reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs Werk clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib traditional gender orms to Leibe, having lost his vision of the fate of Arab women who have occurred."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a apparently lower unfamiliar woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years Jordan has increased the number of 'Honenmorde' - the inofficial outside left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch recognized that the number of ambition in 2016 reached their peak in 2016; however, that Jordan is still lacking the institutional infrastructure, in order to support the women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence to assist in proper way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law concerning disruptions from the year 1954, women are exposed to inalienable violence, and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee by the family that the woman has nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it, also not to be traced to themes in his country as tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib argued that his work is politically, but it is a fact that he can separate his music, the full explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was saying to politics," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and in" "Ghareeb" "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are politically politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a suspicion is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which you can get in his words," that can be what you want "- be it faith or non-faith, heterosexuality or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians speaks and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still strongly influenced by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordanian OnlineProgramme Roya, in order to later note that his comments have been torn out of the context, distorted his mind."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, however, it was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today Hdaib is open to the arabLGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance do not unequip Islam to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in mind today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks themselves: if Abu Nuwhat was to work later on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century openly could write homosexuality, why can Jordanier that not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with mosashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemite Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the current shareholder service took several former government members and members of the teacher, with the rationale, they were expressed on comments in social media critical to the problems which coincides with the deep in the country-root corruption."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert Hdaibs show that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structured change in the next generation of the Jordan river."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a continuous giving and take. Jordan, Mashrou'Leila now sees a performance in a row, but the way of progress - it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, bedside and internation changes. he is sure that these changes came from day to day in the heart of the jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"I also dreamed Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he had not only dreamed of his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is affected by music, art and literature of a genuine and basic openness - and not by bombs, streetables and on artificial fashion. at least hoped it."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is far, Hdaib will continue, and therefore also resist resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2152">"one thought that there is a variation of the Tanabata festivals, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory emerged that armies from West Japan were over in the north-east to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to force its knees."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the paper" "love-ships on guerrilla", "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article will be published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letter to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who feel exceedingly, affection opposite?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"just this question, the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation of BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation is no longer taken from the head and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters for reconciliation), the young people sometimes exvaled to write guerrilla letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her country was swings of a historic event and they wanted to help her part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guererillabewash FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the conclusions of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international was considered to be the undersigned of the peace agreement as such, that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received for its services in the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Colombian people, however, is a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrigriffler who lived for many years in illegal camps, who were exposed to war rhetoric, and around the clock their weapons must be re-integrate into life as a civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, which had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla warfare, this now needs to take up into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians have been assembled and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love-ships on former guerrilla war in order to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the goal of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for any former guillers, which shall be handed over to personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters for reconciliation was born on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, which took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there had Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak short of Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this declared that we love the people that we love, on Valentine's Day of thousands of love letter, but those forget that they need much more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he is planning, told he continued to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and have a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history into a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters have been collected in the context of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Columbus, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I have never imagined that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were passed on 19 March at one of the UN warehouse in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the foundation of BogotArt traveled in the camp to transfer the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC sat down as they had done before to take the precepts of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no precepts, but letters of subsistence of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all participants." it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between, "told the policy expedition Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we passed the letters, a former fighters led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw into one of the" Cambuches "(a type of cabin, in which the guerrilla live), I saw a guerricher, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I had fear that hinders, because besides him on the bed was a MGL-Granatelle, a deadly weapon in the Dornbushash."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I said to him nevertheless," "Hello, what do they do?" "he answered," I answered a letter that someone has written me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so nice, so I answered on it. I suddenly walked the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I impoverished him very firmly and sat down beside the granatamps.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"maybe he was pity, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this struggles, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. the FARC, was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the hunger strike." I have never imagined that someone would forgive me for my fault. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside, which is waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"finally, students and some leaders of the FARC were led to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave an insight into their views on the peace process:" "many years we have experienced how social injustice comes from the state to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the company in this country."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this size order it is worth to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed by:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who have never had heard of hearing and had no choice, and to realize that people who often have seen as monsters and even hate, that were caused by their living conditions and the environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does me hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all people - even those who killed and so much damage to us, and can give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Kolumbianers was prophesied that after the dearming Peace would rule peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it gives inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will be people who are willing to attack the weapons and to protest to their rights. and that is completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all that dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring victim, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be implied."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for safety reasons I don't want to give their name well, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the land, but then it happened something imcredible."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without sign up without notice, without any case, without anything."</seg>

<seg id="2305">Came to and checs in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a foreigner.</seg>

<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which hotel you do. you even know your mould number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my fame number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the gender balance, however, that is a taboan issue."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally casicasian elements I am still running in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"so much I wish, this seelic barrier I cannot overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always tell that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with a camera, I actually give myself trouble, like the person to watch out of their past - thus to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed dorm?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"I spoke with someone, who has sent one and a half months in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan no human beings were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite relatives, these are taking care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" honour "has experienced through blood Genugtution."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men detained in this secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there was not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then especially those who have no rich relative or which were dropped from their relatives to face Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are being held there, so that they can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be converted, you will show their bodies on TV and claim they could have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, but specifically targeted to radiating themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a muting or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just have someone who was incarcerated one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after her beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so called Lord, this person was even better than these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as a bandits, but there have been no reports for so far. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people, who took up a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always contributed my hair to her.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I believe, already before 2003 I was already known to Grosny, when I lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I had never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, back then it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia wanted to lead us to the" "civilisation" "but ultimately brought us back to the Stoneage."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were frozen; I had colored eyelashes, contributed Tubejeans and short Tops. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the Scharia has never bent me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like I met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and all the city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been instructed.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spotte do not say about the unhappiness in another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It often says to children if those who are about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, they are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never sinned me, never hunted and never threw. "</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long held this Gnat?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to speak on morals."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not spoke about us, but above the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had previously been smiled and smiled, consider you at one time with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic was constantly merged."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you think now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I did not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacups, interaction, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get fingerings."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people myself when I haphipped shelter.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help.</seg>

<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so is nature, that has no means to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens who want to know you with foam before the mouth, that there are no gay people in them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestanans have which, the cabardiner have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet, there is it - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant for me to hear what to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I have been here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">"many of them - practicing Muslims, going into the mosque, and during Ramadan, live with men together."</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transitional identity to men who love men, and they believe that man changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a trusting."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise, different ways of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I will be here personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>

<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredden, the first plant that grown by NASA Astronauts in space and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Mortons of work was just driven by its own accident and the question how many salads may get, limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but in the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that ever more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents not only apply for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crowning leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as grain or carton locations. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as the passionate representatives of a millennia tradition, Morton still salads, he needs to do so much longer as his work is continually increasing by ever more limitations."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as if there is a rock bread in a river that I have to walk around."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breed tradition," "he says." I think that these patents go on salads. "</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand in court, no one can breed any new salads, because all of the features are already patented. so he is doing so good as possible and tries to brighten those characteristics that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavor to use any material that is being protected as intellectual property."</seg>

<seg id="2645">"it was called to life to ensure that some plant species and gene is not protected as intellectual property, and thus are usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the framework of the initiative, in short Ossi, U.S. breeders can commit to use other seeds free of them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and can sell it." open source "breeders simply allow others to breed their seed, to breed their own varieties and not immediately uttered - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plants."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Whispering views</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emental professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi directors, Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the opportunity to grow new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed plays to him according to a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try, latter isn't or only little to exploit by seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement is not busy with GM plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not." to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we also need to know how it is being offered on farms in August and September 2016, it should also know that the way that this vegetables is bred.

<seg id="2657">"Ossi-supporters argued that the future of food supplies is threatened, since the available genital pool due to the increasing intellectual property rights based on plant material, which is thus always limited, unfolding."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all carton characteristics is protected as intellectual property, which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or not."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-built plants like wheat in even bigger style are patented as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so excited that they have targeted characteristics - from such, by which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they stick to certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeders are more and more patents abuses. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions are far worse by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-speaker Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is important and also crucial for Monsantos's activities. with a total of four genital banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Economic Affairs of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that the intellectual property restricts other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varieting innovations promote. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions can help others with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection are not inhibited innovation, but supports them by providing the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years waiting to wait until a patent turns, it certainly has no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you are waiting for so long to wait for plants, which are adapted to plants that have already been adjusted to the changed environmental conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monotonous incentives for us are not attractive. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton is disturbed to patently in the concept of self-characteristics," we do not really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants consist of themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, Plant-intimidation in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" who bred a sorting, also bred his own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and monocultural believes in their cultivation of mass-wise herbicide, bred in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is precise. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, it will be able to survive the most smaller seeds - either refuse it or do it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>

<seg id="2682">"I need to constantly use new material for my catalogue since I know that my competitors sell my varieties in a few years," "he says." "with a patent you are for 20 years before competition, which makes it very nice to make it very nice."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the U.S. seem to be a leader in the" Open Source "breeding, but the concept itself rapidly spread throughout the world."</seg>

<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol works on an" open source "license, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding is different from country to country, why Ossi is not easy to transfer one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016 the executive powers of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventional plants should not be patentable against the current practice of the European Patentamts, which permits patents on conventional plants."</seg>
