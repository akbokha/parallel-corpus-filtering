this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as an New York Times .
&quot; long before each of Edward Snow@@ den had heard , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular , that the N@@ SA heard illegal teleph@@ ones by Americ@@ an@@ ers . &quot;
but it is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US @-@ secret operation , in which the CIA has been literally dr@@ unk for an atomic bom@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if the lo@@ opy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an unbelievable history .
but do you know who the chapters were not resolved at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government has been determined against reven@@ ge and called it to call him its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this move , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Treaty , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this law if media does not get this information , and if the identity of the brave cannot protect them . &quot;
&quot; so when the government did with reven@@ ge , he did something that many brave re@@ por@@ ters did already before him , he refused , and said , that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen thus lived with the risk to go into jail . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , happened something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , though she had been for years that it would be crucial for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ters and springs can always hide less .
&quot; rather than to fail and to bring reven@@ ge to the statements , this could also take his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without the consent , made by his phone rings , &quot;
&quot; just as his email data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even irrit@@ ation with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers and Ris@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is just one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect the wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how it can be a problem , especially because the government is too many of her work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional governance , because the government has ever more possibilities to sp@@ y all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the technology of the government allows to handle the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press may also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; while they are able to contact them from the moment , rather than in retro@@ spect , in a witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which had not yet been written as reven@@ ge has written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source charging system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet famous , which was developed by us , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation which I have worked . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents , or send any information such as your usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , at which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer describe any further information , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the start . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect the press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are always developing new es@@ pion@@ ag@@ et@@ technologies that thre@@ aten us all . &quot;
&quot; it is to us to ensure that not only technology divi@@ den@@ omin@@ ator as Edward Snow@@ den have a way of bringing mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; the about ab@@ norm@@ alities in the supply of soldiers is hum@@ ble and reported from crowded hospitals , the alarm for the se@@ dition water of Fl@@ int suggests . or an Wall@@ street insi@@ der , which war@@ ned us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest Daten@@ l@@ ery of history published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; has been hidden from the Global Wit@@ ness by Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we do &#93; by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm mos@@ bags Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers at companies such as mos@@ bags Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , how it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
British Prime Minister has resign@@ ed .
&quot; also , there are reports that an association of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad stamp @-@ firms in tax hav@@ ens has . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace amounts of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , one famous c@@ elli@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people , and others that are nervous to wait for the next publication , and to the next reve@@ aling documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the P@@ lot of a agency gri@@ lled or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham .
&quot; it seems cri@@ es of you , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we tackle this ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and powers are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and that affects all of us .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , this disclosure is phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in all over the world , media and leading politicians , how secret tax hav@@ ens are being utilized by a few of them , their assets to hide and to wear -- something that we have been discussing and un@@ cover for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people this whole world seems very conf@@ using , and it is difficult to understand how this tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind this prayer . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for criminal prosec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is . &quot;
I find it also interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because it has not been a prominent American present in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , according to which these tax hav@@ ens function , has mos@@ bags Fon@@ sec@@ a less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a backup of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples which have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US states less information needs to provide less information to create a company than to obtain a libr@@ arian code . &quot;
&quot; this type of in@@ transparent in the U.S. has allowed the employees of school districts , school@@ children . &quot;
it has been permitted to prevent particularly appealing investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does that work ?
&quot; so , we sent an un@@ covered investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African Minister , who wanted to bring money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really sho@@ cked it really that all the way up to an attorney our investig@@ ators did , how he could trans@@ verse his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all prec@@ epts . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no money was handed over to us . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider that not as a single case .
&quot; it is not about a single attorney , who has led to our un@@ covered mer@@ its proposals . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single peak of peak , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we must change the rules to compl@@ aining this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound everything very well , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing could have changed , as if there is always the rich and mighty . &quot;
&quot; but as an un@@ born optimum , I see that some things have begun to change . &quot;
&quot; in the last few years we have seen preced@@ ence to more transparency , which affects the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has gathered in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who is really behind firms in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a legislative power in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not matter the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who will be fur@@ ious , when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and campaign@@ ing to end through laws this kind of in@@ transparent . &quot;
&quot; together we can end the In@@ transpar@@ ence , which is now possible to end this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das would be . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ yard . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through all the land . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; when we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what am I now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him . he says , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I do not want to end in the trunk of a Maz@@ el ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; then I heard me saying , &quot; I have a air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was then in bed , I aff@@ le to the blank@@ et and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I have in touch ? &quot;
a wild bo@@ died in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such fear that I got out of the bed , on the ti@@ to@@ es at the door , and my sleeping room was closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork , which he had bought from me is now in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as stran@@ gers are actually friends who just waited to be discovered ?
&quot; to host people on my air mattress , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we make a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost set , my ro@@ ommate shares and the rent is increased . &quot;
I experienced that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can create it to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ ommate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I survived how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer @-@ bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WLAN and a desk including , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and recorded so &quot; a@@ erial rat@@ ch@@ et and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress to sleep on wooden floors .
&quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot;
&quot; I am sure to decor@@ ate our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ et , completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we touring with them all over the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , rigi@@ d Brian and i got us . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former fellow @-@ ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Br@@ arc@@ zy@@ k , joined us as developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we would like to create a site on the people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting is over . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can then invite to a wild foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; nobody who is still quite con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children all have learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you get to the things that you can . we could des@@ ig@@ n . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design such a thing ?
is it possible to create confidence with design trust ?
&quot; I would like to give you a cost @-@ tasting , which degree of confidence we acc@@ entu@@ ate . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
&quot; now , I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone . &quot;
give your un@@ available mobile phone to your left .
&quot; this silent flight flight of panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel , when they open the first time the door . &quot;
&quot; for the only thing , what more personal than your mobile phone is , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the mobile phone of a foreig@@ ner in your hands ?
most are the responsibility .
so most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; only once , who has actually Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ? &quot;
&quot; could you announce to Twitter , that he serves as President of the President ? &quot;
you can now return the mobile phones .
they have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we have changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour would have imagined once again with his name ; if he tells you wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children were hot ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you could have 150 Be@@ ur@@ als , who all say : &quot; he can really love very well un@@ err@@ y hand@@ ys ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ made feedback system strengthens the trust decisive .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to prevent negative indications .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both the host and guest had given their jud@@ g@@ ings before we asked them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are with regard to age and residence . &quot;
little surprisingly we trust the people most that are most appreciated .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social occurrence .
exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by means of jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; if you have less than three divisions , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , but changes all . &quot;
a good reputation sti@@ ched simil@@ arity .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ root preference .
&quot; furthermore , we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you get there . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; when one tells too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells you much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is more likely not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; w@@ ool works of art in your home ! &quot; &quot; I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree an openness ?
&quot; we use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text , we also give tips on which topics to write . &quot;
&quot; our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help , overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; what we did not reck@@ on , the great multitude of people who were more than willing to put these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
&quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , a need for previously not been covered . &quot;
for us the business is just very good .
&quot; of course , there are also times when not everything is smoothly running . &quot;
there were guests who are not allowed to attend parties or have apartments rus@@ hed .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the front line , when trust was broken . &quot;
there is nothing sh@@ lim@@ mer@@ it as these calls . I already hurt if I only think of it .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the An@@ ru@@ fer , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , from the 123 million exp@@ ended nights only a fraction ever had a problem . &quot;
for people trust each other rightly .
&quot; if trust works , it can be real@@ is@@ able . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host went to hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his jud@@ gement :
perfect house for travellers who tend to be due to sitting activities to heart attack .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Al@@ ej@@ andra are real guard angels who save one of the lives , even though they don &apos;t know anything right . &quot;
&quot; they drive one in your own car hospital if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want you feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
they leave a longer stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay is running . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money trans@@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is here about an economical trade .
&quot; but it is now simply called &quot; &quot; lease &quot; , &quot; the thing is not righteous . &quot;
&quot; Share Economy describes a trade , human relationships . &quot;
&quot; people are part of itself open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; if you travel nowadays , it is fast and reliable with Fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but for that less auth@@ en@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; but what would , if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ? &quot;
&quot; what would be if at any place you visit , a group would have been waiting to fill a group there Ans@@ wers to fill a thorough and one at a pub tour of the neighborhoods where you have never heard before ; &quot;
or if one could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed based on privacy according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to share apartments from the ground up to the shared bathroom ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of a shared part ?
&quot; I imagine cities which allow us to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and barriers . &quot;
&quot; in the South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government , &quot;
&quot; students were offered to residents . students who were looking for a lead , &quot;
people were convey@@ ed to people whose children were moved . there were inc@@ ub@@ ators program started .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , at least 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guests at a stran@@ ger or even hosts . &quot;
the idea seems to not be so crazy as it was brought to us .
we have not invented the wheel .
hospitality was also previously available .
there have been similar websites before us .
so why has our works ?
&quot; apart from luck and tim@@ ing , we believe that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ root prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find this amazing , &quot;
straight @-@ overwhelming .
I don &apos;t have to think about when a red Maz@@ da is past me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us if it had such great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a beli@@ ever ? a Expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or suppres@@ sed , a bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist attack ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; thus , the media represent people who look like me . &quot;
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most of them would not know Muslims .
probably people do not talk to their users .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a cup of coffee -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with Sah@@ ne extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
a Mö@@ ller @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslims . &quot;
&quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head coverage . &quot;
my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were kidn@@ apped : &quot; why supp@@ ress you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lus@@ tige was : back then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely opposite the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only assumed the faith of my parents .
I have been with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , was thinking in question , des@@ perate and credi@@ ble . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
&quot; she was trust and slow dedication , which deep@@ ened with any reading of the coral . &quot;
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to wines .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever feeling that someone you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow love ? &quot;
this is how it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I later had , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then that horrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had at the end of my breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; Eil@@ at &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; then smoke , planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ ged from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned fast into revol@@ t .
why should you do something ?
&quot; I moved the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only attacked my country , but in the N@@ u transformed me the deeds of others by a civil war in a suspic@@ ious . &quot;
the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new town and begin with the study programme .
&quot; I remember how I drove me -- as we were silent , so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d carefully &quot; , &quot; lead in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day to gather to the Muslims .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of this .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably harmless and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or by people who held for Muslims into the Free and struck . &quot;
there were really burnt @-@ hits on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; because people who had attacked this land , have attacked our country . &quot;
I have rejected the anger of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to continue to explain .
I have nothing against questions I love questions .
these are the alleg@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor to be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the US , but a life @-@ important organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ oni@@ ken . &quot;
will the closing of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
it may be released a few parking spaces but not stop terror .
&quot; the regular visit to a mosque leads to view people other fai@@ ths toler@@ ant , and larger public participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently said : people are actually not pat@@ ched in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer .
&quot; in the radi@@ cal@@ alisation process we have noticed that he goes online . as a First , the person is cut down from their family , even by their family , so that the person believes the terrorists , the true Muslims , and everyone who desp@@ ises their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor , or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS reveals its brut@@ ality with the Quran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to their imagination , when one recogni@@ zes them as a representative of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Club Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you thro@@ ws a look at it , she does not drive what they do in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding I@@ mam recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she would have imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual , with whom she had spoken , she brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , she would only bring in trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that her anger had given sense , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who said her a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam asked the connection to God and her church .
&quot; instead of accused her for her anger , he showed her constructive way for real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , kept it before to join the IS . &quot;
that was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption affect our democracy every day on our minds ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear us pass at least three things .
&quot; we accept more an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : when one reports test messages , in which negative about Muslims was reported , they voted rather military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just a ak@@ ade@@ mic problem .
&quot; when you look at when the mood against Muslims from above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the preparation of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; thus , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for mani@@ p@@ ulation of the public to equi@@ p the foundation of a free society , the reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early self @-@ sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear sends us all . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of coll@@ ectiv@@ ism , it is not only about how to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; he was involved in the dental faculty , talented , lots of promise ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet , generous person , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is out of my frat@@ ernity , such a sealed young man became ? &quot;
&quot; just a couple of weeks after a visit from Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was mur@@ dered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , which was in the afternoon to visit . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after spending his statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he took eight times on De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we taken to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we got it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would be able to control us through fear , or one where we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided to find the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the child seat , we were silent , with high pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , moved my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement , and called our guests , because half of the gathered Christians were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , A@@ thei@@ st , believers and non @-@ credit@@ ors who have come to stand for us , but to teach us . &quot;
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose for the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to play it ?
&quot; or will you connect to those who think , we are better than that . &quot;
thank you .
thank you beautiful !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have taken a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say , who might say that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk to work a thought with dr@@ au@@ ght , thus an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say do not dec@@ eive you . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my history is not unusual .
I am usually as it allows .
&quot; if you look to Muslims around the world , and I did it with the largest study conducted by Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I have no exception in any respect .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for craf@@ ler , it is about to become a billion business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats . possible , this is made possible in research institutions around the world . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ package entrance into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago they began to fly with soap . &quot;
by inter@@ locking flight devices high speed and acceler@@ ation on narro@@ wing space .
you can also build self @-@ employed structures .
&quot; they have learned to wear loads , handle tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react on natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the Pos@@ sible flight in the autonomous flight .
&quot; thus a system autonomous , it must know collective complaint , where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alisation technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a off@@ springs of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
any flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available at the highest E@@ ben@@ e. e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and end . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ;
&quot; a flight , which tries to hit two flies with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other Star@@ ra@@ ils , it is efficient in advance @-@ excursion efficiently , much more efficient than helic@@ op@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star@@ ters it can fluctu@@ ate , so it has great advantages in start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of hed@@ g@@ utter is that they react sensi@@ tively to tur@@ mo@@ il as wind bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that air device no matter in which situation the optimum position can be reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by exercising .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often present ourselves fundamental abstract questions that penet@@ rate the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be for example : what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ opter are known about as machines with thousand moti@@ ons who work together to hurt you .
&quot; three decades ago , trained pilot @-@ controlled air appliances were flying , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate . &quot;
&quot; long ago , we discovered that flies with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest remote air device . it was recently invented . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ ap , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ bles , no further actu@@ ator or control areas , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechanical simp@@ el , happens in the inner live very much , so that it can fly as stable and moving in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the tail@@ gate . to get it to the flies , I have to throw it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; probability to throw it right correctly , if all look at it is low , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is a practice in gen@@ dar@@ ker , this machine is here , the om@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that it is not symmet@@ ric .
&quot; therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment . &quot;
&quot; therefore , he will receive the great ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction he filmed or even how he rotating . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of inter@@ active rivers from the eight prop@@ ell@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; some is adjustable in models , the rest will be learned directly on the box . &quot;
see you that .
&quot; if flying machines must once be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
this is clo@@ ck@@ wise in the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they act like a high @-@ performance squares . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly on , even if restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate that by half an air@@ planes .
the last demonstration is studied synthetic war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took the ordinary Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a disc bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alisation technology and algorithms .
&quot; every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit . &quot;
hopefully motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the most safe machines out there would like to keep on Broadway a flying lamp@@ shade .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the sal@@ ary is in the development and the creation .
&quot; it serves as memory , as wonderful and enchanting , our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart homes , to form them in a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; 1,3 billion years ago in a very far distant galax@@ y , two black holes are each other faster , they turned into pure energy in a ti@@ n@@ tel@@ es@@ try in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , her bright as all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire known universe . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but your energy placed them not in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space period of time and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let &apos;s arrange the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago there was a majority of zel@@ liges lives on Earth .
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot , cor@@ als , fish , plants , sauce , people and -- God stand with us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group was particularly brave -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are created by col@@ li@@ di@@ ing black holes . &quot;
most of them stopped them crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized it as a crazy gene , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation secured their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector L@@ IG@@ O : laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ observ@@ atory @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could be increased significantly , which improved the detection performance . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is now called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O . &quot;
&quot; in early September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes were through the earth . &quot;
you went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott H@@ ugh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my to@@ d@@ ill &apos;s father .
&quot; basically , that were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that , what I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott H@@ ugh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studied gra@@ vit@@ ae from black holes and their through observ@@ at@@ ories like L@@ IG@@ O measurable signals . what are the gravity waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ utter@@ ing in the p@@ ud@@ dle of space and time .
&quot; during the transmission of the wave , the space and its entire content is stretched into one direction and into the other side . &quot;
&quot; to illustrate , lectur@@ ers in courses for the rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often lead a properly al@@ ber@@ n dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that Gravit@@ on@@ waves extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched in the rise of the waves and conf@@ ess . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Dar@@ um , one told the L@@ IG@@ O staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser det@@ ector , and that &apos;s already absurd , these length would have to be measured on less than a 1000@@ th of the radius of a nuclear power . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text over gravity
&quot; described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are abundant . &quot;
&quot; however , physi@@ cists are fin@@ alised and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims , L@@ IG@@ O be more than an eye than an eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial lifts , the size of your mobile . &quot;
this is quite handy ! because so you can create a picture or a map of things by coming out the light coming from several points coming around you .
for tones it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to manufacture an image of things that mean you especially much : &quot;
the face of your child .
&quot; instead we go according to specific properties such as clay and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now speaks only Alice . &quot;
and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them .
&quot; stupid Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in the space with them .
&quot; but by doing changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least lie for L@@ IG@@ O the common frequencies in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert wav@@ ef@@ patterns in all , we can speak all that literally . &quot;
&quot; the gravity to listen , can tell us about much about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been dealing very long for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rot@@ ting holes , circul@@ ate simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two body very quickly , you hear the same comp@@ elling with an additional sound@@ ing change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement , shaped in the wav@@ el@@ ength . &quot;
&quot; AA : 14 September 2015 -- a date , which at least I will never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O Fol@@ der : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des Sound &#93; J@@ em@@ and , who knows what he has to hear , recognize that as a sound of -- SH : ... two black sol@@ dering of sun mass , which are about as fast as the rod of your mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : superior to us briefly what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns that revol@@ ve around a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the constant importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O p@@ aves a completely new way to study the old city as she had never been possible before .
&quot; on this way , we can listen to the All listen and the invisible . &quot;
so much in all we can see -- practically or in principle -- do not see .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ quar@@ k stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about all this .
&quot; however , the exciting physical processes occur in the nucle@@ us that is hidden behind thousand kilometres of iron , carbon and si@@ lic@@ on . &quot;
we will never go through , as these op@@ ak are . &quot;
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see her , since the urine is covered by his own twi@@ light . &quot;
&quot; using gravity waves , it should be possible until back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and most importantly : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen before , and of which we have no idea . things that we just discover by hearing . &quot;
&quot; in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found equal in the first an@@ gling things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as L@@ IG@@ O they observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so called the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; L@@ IG@@ O enables us to completely different perspectives on the events in space , to the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now exists to be as bold as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the rust@@ ling and comp@@ elling of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ at@@ ories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on Earth and all .
&quot; for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the urine ? &quot;
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before which I feared myself . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I wanted to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
I wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the spectacle ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : just that to do , w@@ ov@@ or I fear , it was my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , to hold talks , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes , which my life deeply changed , on an un@@ expect@@ edly Art It started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; cookies , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; cookies , I need milk for my beak . &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new life setting in my family . from there , I swe@@ ar to play with them once you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always tell Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I exhausted myself very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an intri@@ gu@@ ing side effect : only recently , I was actually complete that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children my career . &quot;
I have a true dre@@ am@@ job .
I am writer . I think things that awak@@ ens you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produced television .
&quot; I make TV , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for taking over 70 hours of the programme into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television program can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days of four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars , three broad@@ casts , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series are running on Thursday night .
&quot; all over the world , my series is running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ ous . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four tel@@ ev@@ isions , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire around the world . &quot;
do you know who this is still doing ?
&quot; nobody , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I would not like to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say to you so all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re talking about a company , a country or a household , to take me seriously if I am talking about it , so that I am saying , I understand that there is not just dre@@ aming at a dre@@ am@@ job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , everything work , all reality , all blood , everything swe@@ at -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is , when I set troops up , when I went on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; this way , one portr@@ ay a high tone , provided a marathon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ern@@ al , cruel and reasonable , and the best thing about it is the sums of it . &quot;
there is such a change in me if the work is going well .
&quot; a sums begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sums sounds like a busy road , I could always go on her . &quot;
&quot; many people suppose when I refer to them the sums , I over@@ write writing , that writing me joy . &quot;
&quot; do not understand me wrong , this does it . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I started working with television production when I began to work and to work and to work , build , creating and working together , I discovered this cause , this sums , this energy . the sums ! &quot;
the sums is more than writing .
the sums in action is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the sums is music . the sums is light and air .
the sums of God is the voice of God in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sums , you cannot stand differently from size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling , not to be compared to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is what is called the sums of it .
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it is called genius .
maybe it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I just know that I &apos;m not for failure , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; I will only tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear one : the more successful I become more , the more episodes , the more labor there , the more labor there , the more things you observe , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country , which I create , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the bu@@ ck . &quot;
I like this sums . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ ck . I am the bu@@ ck .
am I only this amount ?
and then the sums stopped .
&quot; revised , exagger@@ ated , exagger@@ ated , spread . &quot;
the sums stopped .
&quot; now my three daughters to the truth are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that their m@@ um is a single working title . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Sch@@ eme , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
there are the children of an tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums stopped . &quot;
the sums of the engine was hidden .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my sums was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same title work , 15 hours @-@ days , crossed weekends , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeps , does not give up with full hearts , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ Titan Poker
everything was gray and I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sums and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; h@@ ay you from , sil@@ der Author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know what you do is doing , you love to be a ban@@ ker to be a ban@@ ker to be a ban@@ ker to be a ban@@ ker , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how the sums stops , if the sums stops , who is then one ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song ends of my heart , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then I refer to my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; I am on the way out , late it and she says , &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I will already say NO , when I will be conscious of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , they called me not &quot; cookies . &quot; &quot;
she is calling no more &quot; cookies . &quot;
when is this happened ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan I and my sums , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so , says : &quot; M@@ um , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sw@@ amp , I can do nothing but to adjust . &quot;
I am focuss@@ ed .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country , which I create , the marathon that I run , the army , the army , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky finger and dam@@ p kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax pen@@ cils and the song , where it is going to release , or whatever the girl is releas@@ ing in &quot; The Iron &apos;s Queen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ c@@ ely that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is solving .
a mental door goes into and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums were slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , scar@@ c@@ ely there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sums . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the consumer , the title of the title , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am if I describe myself with ship@@ ments and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums is . &quot;
the sums there is no force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent upon the pleasure .
real sums depend on love .
&quot; the sums is the current , which comes from the pleasure of life . &quot;
the real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; true sums ign@@ ores the pressure of the story , the already done tasks , anticip@@ ation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; true sums of God is the voice of God in my ear , but maybe I whis@@ per@@ ed to God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , a lot more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I do this to a fixed rule so I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any debt .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice unless I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; play is not just how they work , how we work . &quot;
the truth is hur@@ ts ;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I am always working , because I love it . &quot;
I rather am at the workplace as home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , for what a man does not work than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well yes , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call me myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we r@@ asen in the garden around , before and back , and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ush soap @-@ bub@@ bles .
&quot; thereby , I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and pu@@ zz@@ led . &quot;
I always pay after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe filled me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask : why have we ever stopped playing with the game ?
you can also tell it ! do they always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; there you probably have right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my children want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me , until they are mon@@ oton@@ ous that they want to make something different . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Marien@@ bad or K@@ eks replaces me .
&quot; and speak my teen daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; everyone can put 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes in the piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready . &quot;
but 15 minutes are dr@@ in !
&quot; my children are my Well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it &apos;s true to feel the sums of peace , a place for his soul peace . &quot;
&quot; it is not going to play with your own children . it is about joy , &quot;
about the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
allow yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out it and keep it up .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I victories . friends meet , books read the day -- &quot;
want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education when I wanted to make myself more and more .
&quot; 15 minutes on the piece , why not get full 15 minutes away ? &quot;
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seems to return if I do not work .
working will not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown melody , she meets me and my soul . I leave me to new ideas . I kno@@ ck me up to new ideas and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the bu@@ ck@@ le of sums it is not me ... not anymore .
&quot; soap , and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sums now .
the sums of life .
the sum of Love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and for this I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire still burn .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums in the country , which I judge , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sums , the more this unusual , colorful , naked and new lifesty@@ les in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am writer . I think things that I bring you to life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live its dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dre@@ am@@ job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
ti@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke , or after an accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a sustained , heavy disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I was surgical procedures in the surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
&quot; surely they have heard from one of the most famous , the &quot; deep underground stimulation . &quot; this impl@@ anted one electrical de deep in the brain , in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that neurological functions tend to be improved . &quot;
it is truly an amazing technology . it enh@@ ances the fate of patients with Par@@ kin@@ son who suffered under fier@@ ce tre@@ m@@ ors and severe pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I want to show you that we are very close .
with something help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading Ober@@ doctor and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I run patients with sk@@ ull @-@ sh@@ ep@@ ma trau@@ ma .
&quot; they have to imagine that sk@@ ul@@ ls of sk@@ ull @-@ trau@@ mas , the brain , and the sk@@ ull pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; to save life , one has to dimin@@ ish the sk@@ ull pressure . &quot;
to do this sometimes you have to remove a part of a tricky brain .
&quot; instead of throwing the hard brain mass , we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to leave cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to leave cells from a tissue , comparable to very small children that will be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
by many publishers there are Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with great green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the Bi@@ ology lessons that stem cells are un@@ mature cells that can transform itself into any cell type of body .
&quot; the adult brain has tri@@ bal cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small nav@@ al of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass within the surgery .
we did another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are imm@@ or@@ tal .
but these cells were different .
they moved slowly and after a couple of weeks they died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but did differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells called hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you can make 4 % of our big @-@ her@@ ri@@ ger@@ es cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the fi@@ sting of the brain .
but why do they remain with us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentr@@ ations near brain injury . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , the brain heating . &quot;
we had to prove that we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of bra@@ ins from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then the cells exactly as cultiv@@ ate as it Jean @-@ François did
&quot; and they are then painted in color , in order to follow them in the brain . &quot;
in the last step we rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed it on the tak@@ eover of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ spl@@ antation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we toler@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we have the same cells into the bra@@ ined brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we traveled the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were returned after a few weeks , they were returned to home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario we had an injury to and irrit@@ ated exactly the same cells , and now the cells remain -- they washed up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been stimul@@ ated .
&quot; the proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells , which we collect in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
you had to take the pell@@ ets from a tray .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stur@@ dy skill level , we last in the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex the to@@ mot@@ oric area . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move her hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they recovered spont@@ aneously , up to a certain extent , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plasti@@ fic@@ ated brain activity . they recover from a certain degree , just as the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain we had achieved the degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left , they see the monkeys that spontaneous . &quot;
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original output from injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see when we rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can free@@ ze and use it later .
&quot; we can use them in other new rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Par@@ kin@@ son . &quot;
&quot; but our dream is still , they impl@@ ant people to impl@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to complete about two kilo@@ grams of papers and forms , in order to run this kind of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a very professional team . &quot;
BG : looking into the future -- you have completed research and tried the permission to start the clinical trials . if you look further into the future as many years it takes to come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the authorisation of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us to start the authority as soon as possible ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it has a long time to select the patients , perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study . &quot;
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural . &quot;
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thanks for your visit to TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you so much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural .
&quot; we don &apos;t see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as an un@@ changing reality .
we believe capitalism inev@@ itably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its great im@@ it@@ ants in Beijing have demonstrated no doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally understood that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- do not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my in@@ timi@@ d friends , told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished , if they would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economical model for genuine democracy . &quot;
&quot; I please , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save ourselves to democracy but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are in common , our future is dark , and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; &quot; Twin @-@ par@@ adox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the dec@@ anting austerity and corporations , which could be anxi@@ ous to invest in where it would be productive and also gain all the things that humanity needs urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months in the United States , in England and in the euro area , 3.4 tri@@ llion invested US dollars , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 billi@@ on@@ ous US dollars sounds too much money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ llion US dollars that have been around for the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the exchange rates and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital is the random summit , which is not the same by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently , a low @-@ level economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest . just like E@@ di@@ pus Father , who would not kill him , when he will kill him , when he will grow , &quot;
&quot; invol@@ unt@@ led the circumstances at hand , which lead him k@@ ill@@ pus k@@ ills him . &quot;
this is my ha@@ zy with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely wast@@ ew@@ ood species All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance all of the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I think already . but before we proceed : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the corporate form in which the free and poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many from --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , there would be an error to under@@ mines the significance of ath@@ etic democracy due to these terms . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that they left the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but is more important and crucial that they impose their right to political co @-@ determination in questions of the state of government . &quot;
ath@@ etic Democracy has not been held for a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which lit very bright , it is also rapidly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our today &apos;s liberal democr@@ acies have not their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ etic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruling class . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible , as a complete separation of politics and economy , and the democratic process of politics was founded , while the economy -- therefore the world of corporations -- a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our today &apos;s democr@@ acies , the separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ her@@ edit@@ ary battle between the two and the economy is gradually under@@ rated the policy . &quot;
wonder why politicians can no longer be the same as in the past ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of her DNA .
&quot; it is because you can be in the government today and still not in power , because power from politics into the economy is s@@ ander@@ ed and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ vo@@ iced with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is about as a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that are so sustainable the animals , of which they nour@@ ished , under@@ nour@@ ished that it is therefore star@@ red at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that the politics is so far angular economic crisis itself , that it grows by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself , political goods are raised , inequality increases , the overall economic demand and the managing director of corporations are too anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; exp@@ ose from democracy , the higher the ten@@ ing summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity . &quot;
&quot; that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; hold control , like in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the teaching of the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor will only reg@@ ain a position like in the ancient Athens , without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is one solution : to create the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing kidney @-@ workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation has become higher , the waste , and social conflicts deeper , as it is already very soon as I believe - in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we must embrace the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and thereby ensuring that we have the re @-@ united surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that leaves the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not , whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved by a d@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy , similar to the &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in which machines are serving the people , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we may be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what would it look like it could look , this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; - like to have a &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation I want to call you , in all the short , some examples call . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : ask a capital market in which you earn money , while you work and in which your capital follows you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you &apos;re currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and dis@@ solve and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies but do not work in it , and employees who are working there , but no exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and expenses , and ultimately no em@@ por@@ ous cement summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please briefly point out that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging economies &#93; . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , imagine that the entire world trade will be tr@@ aded in this currency -- call it &quot; the cosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds with the trade deficit or the trade surplus from the country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment funds are r@@ amp@@ ant . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference was proposed by 1944 .
the problem was that one at that time not the technical means had to put it into practice .
&quot; today , we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ated , in which she pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the suffering of history , and key@@ n@@ esian , globally key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will w@@ aking up in such a world
or will we fail into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ?
the answer depends on how we work together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically . &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you descri@@ p@@ able yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... do we do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in economic demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democr@@ acies but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ al democracy is minimal . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ ary Marxist and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also completely wir@@ eless@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are at ease too . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you do not wir@@ l you think not enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the view of the West in China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the sem@@ bl@@ ance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of the most ab@@ duc@@ er , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , when I must say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , resem@@ bles China today the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect to liber@@ alism , with democracy -- that is a fault , historically considered . &quot;
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ ale , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
&quot; he was especially skep@@ tical , which affects the democratic development . &quot;
&quot; what we can watch in China now , resem@@ bles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now to blame China now , to do what the West did in the 19th century itself , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I regre@@ t@@ ted that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal sight , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to adopt us from self @-@ suff@@ iciency , and the continuous denial made that a massive transfer line by the euro area ran , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened with the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was to be revealed to this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately it is right to do . unfortunately , the forces have chosen within the euro zone , in the European group , continues to be the denial . &quot;
&quot; but you know yes , what comes . &quot;
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism are alive , but if then the shift occurs , it happens to be ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future when we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who is returning -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister who claims after 6 months in office , particularly in such a tense situation , claimed , he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was an awesome interest in the pages of the finan@@ ci@@ er , finding a common solution . &quot;
but that was not there .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the ship@@ pers that were going through the Eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to conc@@ ede that she had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; neither of the Troika of credit@@ ors who has imposed us this policy , and a : &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ s@@ ary mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive table of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from somebody who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if they are not survi@@ ves , the fre@@ ed fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroying the European Union . &quot;
this will not be disast@@ rous for Europe but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to beat the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will equally be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans like the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you very much that you were with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price most have never heard , even though it is probably responsible for 22 @-@ term minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy brilli@@ antly met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is conduc@@ tive employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ e@@ fore and describes on Twitter as &quot; &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to repair the Amazon .
&quot; of course , that is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy is not able to select any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are quite right on this corner . &quot;
this curve is the rating of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will be obtained .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , addi@@ c@@ ted , where you have seen a season , your brain asks , &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what goes down at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price not worry about getting the left side of the curve , because I think you have already very special intelligence to offer &apos; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
&quot; he is more thinking about the mean extinction , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply ama@@ ze . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon does something , so Roy Price nothing to risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he will hold a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and chosen by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can look at everyone for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon gives out for free things , you can access it correctly ? &quot;
millions of vie@@ wers look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching this shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team that all record .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you p@@ auses , which parts you can ski@@ ps or again . &quot;
collect millions of data to decide with these data to determine which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process this and resulting in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha house lan@@ det with 7.5 -- therefore something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking for this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team got the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give the shows whose course they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these small details about the viewer : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; house of Cards &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this turn . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , is the question : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because logic leads somehow that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you coll@@ ects millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should be able to make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized using very powerful computers .
&quot; Min@@ des@@ te , what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is something fright@@ ening , because we live in a time in which we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
do someone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one will ever come in touch with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in the US and ask for dismis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismis@@ sal is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
this is not always the best results generated . this is not that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most diversi@@ fied companies are even wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google does not make mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can say about data analysis of flu , the sch@@ lim@@ men way , predicted -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a great news sensation . the success story in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it was simply not working , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data is sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something .
&quot; despite all of these errors , data has been notic@@ eably in decisions of life -- at the workplace , in terms of enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should rather make sure that data is helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people make un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns over the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; you ever have to solve the problem , do mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; as a First &#93; , place this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the individual parts again to grasp a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you need to do this several times , but there are always two things to take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put together the parts again and then come to a resolution .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain . &quot;
&quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces come together again , even if the information is incomplete , then to put a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and mind , where they will also go down in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their public what else would not have been capable of . but the decision , how to take all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; that does not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon however , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they belong to TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; they say to us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired outcome .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions with a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question , you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot;
I will get it later with a technology demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions made in my life , whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it by something much more out , such as data analytics to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the base building .
&quot; perhaps the ball wis@@ er and cl@@ ever@@ er , and cl@@ ever@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want something exceptional at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging note that despite the large amount of data still pays off , decisions to meet , an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; for in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right of the curve . &quot;
thank you beautiful .
