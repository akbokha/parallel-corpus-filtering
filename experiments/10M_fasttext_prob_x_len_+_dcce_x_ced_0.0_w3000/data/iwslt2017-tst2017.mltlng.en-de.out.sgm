<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as an New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before each of Edward Snowden had heard, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular, that the NSA heard illegal telephones by Americaners."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US-secret operation, in which the CIA has been literally drunk for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the loopy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable history.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapters were not resolved at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for nearly 10 years, the government has been determined against revenge and called it to call him its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this move, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblowers and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Treaty, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this law if media does not get this information, and if the identity of the brave cannot protect them."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government did with revenge, he did something that many brave reporters did already before him, he refused, and said, that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen thus lived with the risk to go into jail."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, happened something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, though she had been for years that it would be crucial for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and springs can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than to fail and to bring revenge to the statements, this could also take his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without the consent, made by his phone rings,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just as his email data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even irritation with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblowers and Risks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is just one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect the whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how it can be a problem, especially because the government is too many of her work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblowers to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional governance, because the government has ever more possibilities to spy all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the technology of the government allows to handle the rights of reporters, the press may also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"while they are able to contact them from the moment, rather than in retrospect, in a witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which had not yet been written as revenge has written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source charging system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet famous, which was developed by us, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation which I have worked."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents, or send any information such as your usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, at which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer describe any further information, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the start."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect the press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are always developing new espionagettechnologies that threaten us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to us to ensure that not only technology dividenominator as Edward Snowden have a way of bringing misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the about abnormalities in the supply of soldiers is humble and reported from crowded hospitals, the alarm for the sedition water of Flint suggests. or an Wallstreet insider, which warned us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest Datenlery of history published.] [the "Panama Papers" has been hidden from the Global Witness by Global Witness.] [what does that mean?] [we do] by news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm mosbags Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers at companies such as mosbags Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, how it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">British Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that an association of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad stamp-firms in tax havens has."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace amounts of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, one famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people, and others that are nervous to wait for the next publication, and to the next revealing documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the Plot of a agency grilled or a John-Grisham.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems cries of you, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we tackle this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and powers are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Witness, this disclosure is phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in all over the world, media and leading politicians, how secret tax havens are being utilized by a few of them, their assets to hide and to wear -- something that we have been discussing and uncover for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people this whole world seems very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how this tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind this prayer."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for criminal prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it also interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because it has not been a prominent American present in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, according to which these tax havens function, has mosbags Fonseca less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a backup of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples which have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US states less information needs to provide less information to create a company than to obtain a librarian code."</seg>
<seg id="68">"this type of intransparent in the U.S. has allowed the employees of school districts, schoolchildren."</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been permitted to prevent particularly appealing investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent an uncovered investigator to the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself as an African Minister, who wanted to bring money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked it really that all the way up to an attorney our investigators did, how he could transverse his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all precepts. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no money was handed over to us. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider that not as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single attorney, who has led to our uncovered merits proposals."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single peak of peak, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to complaining this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound everything very well, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing could have changed, as if there is always the rich and mighty."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as an unborn optimum, I see that some things have begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the last few years we have seen precedence to more transparency, which affects the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has gathered in central registers at the national level, who is really behind firms in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a legislative power in both parliamentarians, but this does not matter the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who will be furious, when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the headlines."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy that stand up and say:" "Intransparency is not good for business." ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and campaigning to end through laws this kind of intransparent."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can end the Intransparence, which is now possible to end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazdas would be."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design study, I made a backyard."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through all the land. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"when we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep today? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," I don't know. "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him. he says, he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I do not want to end in the trunk of a Mazel!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard me saying," I have a air mattress. you can sleep in my living room. "</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was then in bed, I affle to the blanket and thought:" Oh man! what did I have in touch? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild bodied in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I got out of the bed, on the titoes at the door, and my sleeping room was closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he had bought from me is now in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as strangers are actually friends who just waited to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"to host people on my air mattress, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost set, my roommate shares and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I experienced that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can create it to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I survived how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer-bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WLAN and a desk including, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and recorded so "aerial ratchet and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress to sleep on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure to decorate our cheese ham Omelet, completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we touring with them all over the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, rigid Brian and i got us."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former fellow-roommate, Nate Brarczyk, joined us as developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our Investors:" we would like to create a site on the people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting is over. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"on the Internet, they can then invite to a wild foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody who is still quite consolation, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you get to the things that you can. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a cost-tasting, which degree of confidence we accentuate."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unavailable mobile phone to your left.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this silent flight flight of panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel, when they open the first time the door."</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing, what more personal than your mobile phone is, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the mobile phone of a foreigner in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most are the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"only once, who has actually Al Gores mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">"could you announce to Twitter, that he serves as President of the President?"</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour would have imagined once again with his name; if he tells you whence he comes, how his dog or his children were hot?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you could have 150 Beurals, who all say:" he can really love very well unerry handys! "</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-made feedback system strengthens the trust decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to prevent negative indications.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both the host and guest had given their judgings before we asked them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are with regard to age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most that are most appreciated.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by means of judgments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three divisions, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, but changes all."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stiched similarity.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deep-root preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"furthermore, we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you get there."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"when one tells too little, such as" Hi!, "you do not get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells you much, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is more likely not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "wool works of art in your home!" "I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree an openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">"we use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text, we also give tips on which topics to write."</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help, overcome our prejudices against strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we did not reckon, the great multitude of people who were more than willing to put these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need for previously not been covered."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are also times when not everything is smoothly running."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are not allowed to attend parties or have apartments rushed.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the front line, when trust was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing shlimmerit as these calls. I already hurt if I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the Anrufer, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, from the 123 million expended nights only a fraction ever had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, it can be realisable."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travellers who tend to be due to sitting activities to heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guard angels who save one of the lives, even though they don't know anything right."</seg>
<seg id="218">"they drive one in your own car hospital if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want you feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave a longer stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay is running."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economical trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now simply called" "lease", "the thing is not righteous."</seg>
<seg id="228">"Share Economy describes a trade, human relationships."</seg>
<seg id="229">"people are part of itself open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you travel nowadays, it is fast and reliable with Fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but for that less authentically."</seg>
<seg id="231">"but what would, if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be if at any place you visit, a group would have been waiting to fill a group there Answers to fill a thorough and one at a pub tour of the neighborhoods where you have never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if one could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed based on privacy according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from the ground up to the shared bathroom?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of a shared part?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities which allow us to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and barriers."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in the South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"students were offered to residents. students who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">People were conveyed to people whose children were moved. there were incubators program started.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, at least 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guests at a stranger or even hosts."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to not be so crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also previously available.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we believe that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-root prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find this amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Straight-overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I don't have to think about when a red Mazda is past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had such great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? a Expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brainwashing, a terrorist attack?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"thus, the media represent people who look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most of them would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not talk to their users.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim, it is great to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a cup of coffee -- double espresso, with Sahne extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möller-Fitness-Fanatikerin</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my head coverage."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were kidnapped: "why suppress you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lustige was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely opposite the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only assumed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have been with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, was thinking in question, desperate and credible."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">"she was trust and slow dedication, which deepened with any reading of the coral."</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"had you ever feeling that someone you perceive, you fully understand, and yet somehow love?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I later had, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the" Egyptian American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that horrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I was sitting in my kitchen, had at the end of my breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" "Eilat". ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"then smoke, planes flew in buildings, people spranged from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned fast into revolt.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I moved the television channel and heard:" "Muslim terrorists"... "..." in the name of Islam...,... "..."... "..."... ""... ""... "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only attacked my country, but in the Nu transformed me the deeds of others by a civil war in a suspicious."</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new town and begin with the study programme.</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I drove me -- as we were silent, so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," be vigilant, "" Seid carefully "," lead in well illuminated areas, "" disgusting you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was Friday in that week -- the day to gather to the Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of this.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably harmless and I also heard of attacks on Muslims, or by people who held for Muslims into the Free and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really burnt-hits on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people who had attacked this land, have attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I have rejected the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to continue to explain.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we loose them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor to be removed as a whole and a benign tumor.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the US, but a life-important organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelfer and Olympioniken."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It may be released a few parking spaces but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit to a mosque leads to view people other faiths tolerant, and larger public participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently said: people are actually not patched in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalalisation process we have noticed that he goes online. as a First, the person is cut down from their family, even by their family, so that the person believes the terrorists, the true Muslims, and everyone who despises their behavior and their ideology is a traitor, or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS reveals its brutality with the Quran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add to their imagination, when one recognizes them as a representative of 1,6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Club Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you throws a look at it, she does not drive what they do in their" Holy Scriptures "." "</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things into the scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would have imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual, with whom she had spoken, she brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, she would only bring in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that her anger had given sense, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who said her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam asked the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accused her for her anger, he showed her constructive way for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, kept it before to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption affect our democracy every day on our minds?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear us pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept more an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: when one reports test messages, in which negative about Muslims was reported, they voted rather military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a akademic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look at when the mood against Muslims from above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the preparation of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"thus, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to equip the foundation of a free society, the reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early self-sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear sends us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collectivism, it is not only about how to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was involved in the dental faculty, talented, lots of promise..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweet, generous person, whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is out of my fraternity, such a sealed young man became?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a couple of weeks after a visit from Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, which was in the afternoon to visit. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution, after spending his statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>

<seg id="377">"fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also fatal."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we taken to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we got it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would be able to control us through fear, or one where we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to find the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child seat, we were silent, with high pressure on the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, moved my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, and called our guests, because half of the gathered Christians were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheist, believers and non-creditors who have come to stand for us, but to teach us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose for the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to play it?</seg>

<seg id="407">"what started as a platform for crafler, it is about to become a billion business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats. possible, this is made possible in research institutions around the world."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air-package entrance into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they began to fly with soap."</seg>
<seg id="410">By interlocking flight devices high speed and acceleration on narrowing space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-employed structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to wear loads, handle turmoil and generally react on natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the Possible flight in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"thus a system autonomous, it must know collective complaint, where in the room the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localisation technology of Verity Studios, a offsprings of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Any flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest Ebene. e.g." "start" "and end."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter;</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight, which tries to hit two flies with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Starrails, it is efficient in advance-excursion efficiently, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starters it can fluctuate, so it has great advantages in start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedgutter is that they react sensitively to turmoil as wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that air device no matter in which situation the optimum position can be regained and the performance can be improved by exercising.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often present ourselves fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with thousand motions who work together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"three decades ago, trained pilot-controlled air appliances were flying, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a tailgate."</seg>
<seg id="435">"long ago, we discovered that flies with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically easiest remote air device. it was recently invented."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flap, hinges and cross-rubles, no further actuator or control areas, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanical simpel, happens in the inner live very much, so that it can fly as stable and moving in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to get it to the flies, I have to throw it exactly right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"probability to throw it right correctly, if all look at it is low, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monospinner is a practice in gendarker, this machine is here, the omkopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is not symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">"therefore, it is ambivalent in its alignment."</seg>
<seg id="446">"therefore, he will receive the great ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction he filmed or even how he rotating."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight propellees."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is adjustable in models, the rest will be learned directly on the box."</seg>
<seg id="450">See you that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines must once be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is clockwise in the clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they act like a high-performance squares."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly on, even if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by half an airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration is studied synthetic warms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the ordinary Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a disc bread -- and equip it with localisation technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The most safe machines out there would like to keep on Broadway a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the salary is in the development and the creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as memory, as wonderful and enchanting, our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart homes, to form them in a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But your energy placed them not in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space period of time and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let's arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago there was a majority of zelliges lives on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has brought forth a lot, corals, fish, plants, sauce, people and -- God stand with us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group was particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which are created by collidiing black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them stopped them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people realized it as a crazy gene, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation secured their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: laser-Interferometer- gravitational-observatory-observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following time, the precision of LIGO could be increased significantly, which improved the detection performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, it is now called Advanced LIGO."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in early September 2015 LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collious black holes were through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my todill's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, that were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that, what I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studied gravitae from black holes and their through observatories like LIGO measurable signals. what are the gravity waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cuttering in the puddle of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"during the transmission of the wave, the space and its entire content is stretched into one direction and into the other side."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, lecturers in courses for the relativity-theory often lead a properly albern dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that Gravitonwaves extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched in the rise of the waves and confess. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 Nullen after the comma, followed by a 1st Darum, one told the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's already absurd, these length would have to be measured on less than a 1000th of the radius of a nuclear power. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text over gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"described KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties when building such detectors are abundant. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"however, physicists are finalised and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO be more than an eye than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial lifts, the size of your mobile."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy! because so you can create a picture or a map of things by coming out the light coming from several points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">For tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to manufacture an image of things that mean you especially much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we go according to specific properties such as clay and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now speaks only Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">And Bob interrupts them.</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in the space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by doing changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the common frequencies in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wavefpatterns in all, we can speak all that literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravity to listen, can tell us about much about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been dealing very long for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotting holes, circulate simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two body very quickly, you hear the same compelling with an additional sounding change. that sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement, shaped in the wavelength."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: 14 September 2015 -- a date, which at least I will never forget -- heard LIGO Folder: [Surrendes Sound] Jemand, who knows what he has to hear, recognize that as a sound of -- SH:... two black soldering of sun mass, which are about as fast as the rod of your mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: superior to us briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns that revolve around a hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the constant importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paves a completely new way to study the old city as she had never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">"on this way, we can listen to the All listen and the invisible."</seg>
<seg id="535">So much in all we can see -- practically or in principle -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why masquark stars in Supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about all this.</seg>
<seg id="538">"however, the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus that is hidden behind thousand kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through, as these opak are. "</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would be more transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see her, since the urine is covered by his own twilight."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravity waves, it should be possible until back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen before, and of which we have no idea. things that we just discover by hearing."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found equal in the first angling things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as LIGO they observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so called the Saurierknochen for our archeological work. "</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO enables us to completely different perspectives on the events in space, to the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the rustling and compelling of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">"for what could be nicer than to listen to the urine?"</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">A while ago I tried an experiment.</seg>

<seg id="584">I create TV. I produced television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make TV, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for taking over 70 hours of the programme into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television program can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days of four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars, three broadcasts, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>

<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself and not only produced, so still obendous. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and to tell my stories."</seg>

<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable, and the best thing about it is the sums of it."</seg>

<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums in action is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>

<seg id="621">The sums of God is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, you cannot stand differently from size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling, not to be compared to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what is called the sums of it.</seg>

<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>

<seg id="632">"to make a clear one: the more successful I become more, the more episodes, the more labor there, the more labor there, the more things you observe, the more I write history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more you have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, which I create, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the buck."</seg>

<seg id="639">Am I only this amount?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, exaggerated, exaggerated, spread."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now my three daughters to the truth are accustomed to the truth, that their mum is a single working title."</seg>

<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same title work, 15 hours-days, crossed weekends, no repentance, nothing delegating, a Titan sleeps, does not give up with full hearts, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>

<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is solving.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes into and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums were slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, scarcely there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>

<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke, or after an accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a sustained, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was surgical procedures in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard from one of the most famous, the" deep underground stimulation. "this implanted one electrical de deep in the brain, in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that neurological functions tend to be improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it enhances the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered under fierce tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With something help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading Oberdoctor and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I run patients with skull-shepma trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"they have to imagine that skulls of skull-traumas, the brain, and the skull pressure increases."</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, one has to diminish the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this sometimes you have to remove a part of a tricky brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the hard brain mass, we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to leave cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to leave cells from a tissue, comparable to very small children that will be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">By many publishers there are Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with great green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the Biology lessons that stem cells are unmature cells that can transform itself into any cell type of body.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has tribal cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small naval of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass within the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They moved slowly and after a couple of weeks they died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but did differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You can make 4% of our big-herrigeres cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they ensure the fisting of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injury."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, the brain heating."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brains from the non-linguistic area and then the cells exactly as cultivate as it Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">"and they are then painted in color, in order to follow them in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimbursed it on the takeover of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we tolerate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we have the same cells into the brained brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we traveled the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were returned after a few weeks, they were returned to home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario we had an injury to and irritated exactly the same cells, and now the cells remain -- they washed up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been stimulated.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells, which we collect in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take the pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a sturdy skill level, we last in the motoric cortex the tomotoric area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move her hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, they recovered spontaneously, up to a certain extent, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastificated brain activity. they recover from a certain degree, just as the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain we had achieved the degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left, they see the monkeys that spontaneous."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original output from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, see when we reimbursed the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other new ropathological models, for example at Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">"but our dream is still, they implant people to implant."</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to complete about two kilograms of papers and forms, in order to run this kind of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a very professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: looking into the future -- you have completed research and tried the permission to start the clinical trials. if you look further into the future as many years it takes to come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the authorisation of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority as soon as possible?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it has a long time to select the patients, perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it is necessary to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural."</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thanks for your visit to TED and that you have told us about it. "</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we don't see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as an unchanging reality.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its great imitants in Beijing have demonstrated no doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is dwindling with us in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally understood that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- do not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my intimid friends, told me that democracy would be abolished, if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economical model for genuine democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I please, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save ourselves to democracy but that we need a true and defective democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are in common, our future is dark, and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "" Twin-paradox "." "</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the Schuldenberg, who throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the Schuldenberg,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the decanting austerity and corporations, which could be anxious to invest in where it would be productive and also gain all the things that humanity needs urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months in the United States, in England and in the euro area, 3.4 trillion invested US dollars, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 billionous US dollars sounds too much money, until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars that have been around for the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the exchange rates and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debt and unproductive capital is the random summit, which is not the same by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-old in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently, a low-level economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest. just like Edipus Father, who would not kill him, when he will kill him, when he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"involuntled the circumstances at hand, which lead him killpus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hazy with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely wastewood species All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially to finance all of the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we proceed: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the corporate form in which the free and poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy closed too many from --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, there would be an error to undermines the significance of athetic democracy due to these terms."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the athic democracy was and is that they left the working poor, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but is more important and crucial that they impose their right to political co-determination in questions of the state of government."</seg>
<seg id="935">Athetic Democracy has not been held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which lit very bright, it is also rapidly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our today's liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athetic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible, as a complete separation of politics and economy, and the democratic process of politics was founded, while the economy -- therefore the world of corporations -- a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our today's democracies, the separation of politics and economy began, an unhereditary battle between the two and the economy is gradually underrated the policy."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians can no longer be the same as in the past?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of her DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because you can be in the government today and still not in power, because power from politics into the economy is sandered and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my havoiced with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is about as a flock of carnivores that are so sustainable the animals, of which they nourished, undernourished that it is therefore starred at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that the politics is so far angular economic crisis itself, that it grows by the self-caused economic crisis itself, political goods are raised, inequality increases, the overall economic demand and the managing director of corporations are too anxious to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism the" Demos "[the people] expose from democracy, the higher the tening summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the" Demos "hold control, like in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor will only regain a position like in the ancient Athens, without creating new ways of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to create the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing kidney-workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation has become higher, the waste, and social conflicts deeper, as it is already very soon as I believe - in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must embrace the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and thereby ensuring that we have the re-united surveillance hyperautocracy that leaves the film" matrix "like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not, whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved by a dystroscopy, similar to the" "Star Trek", "in which machines are serving the people, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long talks the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it look like it could look, this" star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" matrix "- like to have a" "matrix" "?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I want to call you, in all the short, some examples call."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: ask a capital market in which you earn money, while you work and in which your capital follows you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you're currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and dissolve and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies but do not work in it, and employees who are working there, but no exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and expenses, and ultimately no emporous cement summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please briefly point out that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging economies]."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, imagine that the entire world trade will be traded in this currency -- call it" the cosmos "," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds with the trade deficit or the trade surplus from the country into a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment funds are rampant."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes in the Bretton Woods Conference was proposed by 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one at that time not the technical means had to put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time liberated, in which she prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the suffering of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will waking up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we fail into a "matrix" - similar dystrophy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we work together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratically."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You descripable yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and business is... do we do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in economic demand, which is called Larry Summers as" "long-term stagnation." "</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is minimal."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just as Hayek, that's why I am a libertary Marxist and like Keynes, and that is why I am also completely wirelessly."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are at ease too."</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you do not wirl you think not enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the view of the West in China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of the most abducer, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, when I must say this provocative, resembles China today the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect to liberalism, with democracy -- that is a fault, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberale, like John Stuart Mill -- "</seg>
<seg id="997">"he was especially skeptical, which affects the democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can watch in China now, resembles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now to blame China now, to do what the West did in the 19th century itself, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I regretted that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal sight, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to adopt us from self-sufficiency, and the continuous denial made that a massive transfer line by the euro area ran, and continues to be massively threatened with the development of the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal was to be revealed to this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately it is right to do. unfortunately, the forces have chosen within the euro zone, in the European group, continues to be the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"but you know yes, what comes."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism are alive, but if then the shift occurs, it happens to be abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future when we do not change its structure.</seg>

<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who is returning -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister who claims after 6 months in office, particularly in such a tense situation, claimed, he has made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"I believed that there was an awesome interest in the pages of the financier, finding a common solution."</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not there.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price most have never heard, even though it is probably responsible for 22-term minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy brilliantly met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is conductive employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelefore and describes on Twitter as" "films, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to repair the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, that is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy is not able to select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are quite right on this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will be obtained.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones "," "The Wire" -- all the shows, addicted, where you have seen a season, your brain asks, "where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what goes down at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price not worry about getting the left side of the curve, because I think you have already very special intelligence to offer 'Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he is more thinking about the mean extinction, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply amaze."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon does something, so Roy Price nothing to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he will hold a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chosen by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can look at everyone for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon gives out for free things, you can access it correctly?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching this shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team that all record.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pauses, which parts you can skips or again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">Collect millions of data to decide with these data to determine which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process this and resulting in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four Republican U.S. senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7,4 is and Alpha house landet with 7.5 -- therefore something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team got the available data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give the shows whose course they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these small details about the viewer: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a car and decided not to make a Sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," house of Cards "." Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons. "</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this turn. so exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, is the question: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic leads somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collects millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should be able to make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized using very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"Mindeste, what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, then this is something frightening, because we live in a time in which we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Do someone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one will ever come in touch with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in the US and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">This is not always the best results generated. this is not that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most diversified companies are even wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google does not make mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can say about data analysis of flu, the schlimmen way, predicted -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news sensation. the success story in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it was simply not working, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data is sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all of these errors, data has been noticeably in decisions of life -- at the workplace, in terms of enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should rather make sure that data is helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people make unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have recognized some patterns over the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you ever have to solve the problem, do mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a First], place this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the individual parts again to grasp a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you need to do this several times, but there are always two things to take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put together the parts again and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all possess it: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces come together again, even if the information is incomplete, then to put a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think Netflix was so successful because they have used data and mind, where they will also go down in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their public what else would not have been capable of. but the decision, how to take all these parts, and make it a show like" House of Cards "," that does not stand in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon however, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they belong to TV ideas, then they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" they say to us the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order not to forget it, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it is amazing. for decisions with a Ja- or no-question, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- exactly here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will get it later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions made in my life, whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it by something much more out, such as data analytics to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the base building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball wiser and cleverer, and cleverer. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want something exceptional at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging note that despite the large amount of data still pays off, decisions to meet, an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
