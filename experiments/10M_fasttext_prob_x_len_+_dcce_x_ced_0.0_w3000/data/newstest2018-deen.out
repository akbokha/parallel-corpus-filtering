Munich 1856 : four cards to change the city
an Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt where young people can meet today .
&quot; a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where now is used for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the bl@@ asts of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days .
it is annoying if maps are not currently up .
&quot; this knows everyone who had to rain from time , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a h@@ yst@@ ary street showed a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the government , are far from the current one - but that is why very enlight@@ ening . &quot;
especially when you compare them with current online maps .
then the towns and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
&quot; in the large overview map for cities and communities were dealt with more detailed cards , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tional leaves . &quot;
these were made according to the declaration of the state administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and ski@@ p the first Ver@@ messung Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader in Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War in Austria .
Napoleon wished to get an overview of the occupied country and gave an top@@ ograph@@ ical reception of Bay@@ erns into order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops moved to the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : there were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of an extensive Bavaria @-@ map .
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drive forward the project , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; and thus the Bay@@ erische surv@@ ey@@ ing administration . &quot;
the first posi@@ tional sheet for Munich is from the year 1856 and is like the other one on the website of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer National Library .
&quot; the comparison of fruits / Today , the capital of the state capital is the most impressive . &quot;
the city has extended itself in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated .
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was established 21 years after the creation of the map , so 1877 , as a coin . &quot;
&quot; today , sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses under@@ ne@@ ath focus around 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : in the first glance : in writing , a small dis@@ advant@@ aged card will appear with doz@@ ens of lines and figures : hand@@ written numbered Fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; plot of &quot; &quot; from which the property tax was derived . &quot;
small plots there are no farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the complex &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is characterized by the north of under@@ end@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz of the October Court , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete form in the 19th century . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the area of the present District A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one does not only read the road name &quot; on Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the &quot; &quot; height &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , there are once more people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard of G@@ ud@@ den the institution - that Psy@@ chiat@@ rist , which was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the acquisition of the so called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; in addition , he is forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has dedicated himself to an exhibition of the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had first been place , later on 500 seats were expanded . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; there since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per Bla@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East , is one of Germany &apos;s biggest psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ sts in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on the field of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people will encounter young people in Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the Order was built in the Assembly of 1920 , and turned him into a youth @-@ heim with training . &quot;
&quot; west is the football field of the T@@ SV München East , east residence houses from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 you set up the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; - an ar@@ quit@@ ecture to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ eged , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in Bom@@ ben@@ attack . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was around 1856 as a &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the purchase road was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the Bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city centre .
a great stayed until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a se@@ ven@@ ing chapel standing from the Middle Ages was once at the Marien@@ hof , where these days were the pre @-@ work and place on the 5th April 2017 of the sp@@ aten@@ sti@@ ch for the second S @-@ Bahn course . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich card can be compared to the a@@ erial photograph of today - and the hole in the Marien@@ hof . &quot;
civil rights group released out of travel for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of coloured has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling on the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state after Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state Mis@@ sour@@ i , which should enter into force until 28 August 2017 , as a number of frag@@ worthy , racial @-@ based deposits in recent times occur in the whole state and can be noted here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it more difficult to win Dis@@ cri@@ mination , as well as the criminal authorities of the state , the dis@@ proportionate effect on minorities , promp@@ ted the group to come out the tour , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that people happen .
&quot; they are raised because of their skin colour , they are be@@ aten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ansas City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear discomfort in such an incidence , which we have not yet heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning which has issued the organisation for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group quoted inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist mer@@ ging against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see . &quot;
&quot; unlike fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having had no gas@@ oline during the journey through the state , and was taken in cust@@ ody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also indicates a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will be more common than past@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be willing to bring it to fear or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state .
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate speech in 2015 after the latest figures from the Hass@@ an bre@@ eder @-@ reporting programme of the F@@ BI which sets the state with regard to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country .
&quot; the itinerary is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ ES ) took place in Texas and Arizona , after the states of immigration laws passed , the local criminal law enforcement authorities aimed to susp@@ end people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to the AC@@ ES to further r@@ attle . &quot;
&quot; travel orders are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but in recent times we have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
Wei@@ gh@@ aun@@ ching project is elementary
the Wei@@ gh@@ acher Wei@@ gh@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac have created a picture on site .
at the R@@ ist@@ le of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family representative of the Fis@@ her@@ ter CD@@ U @-@ local association with Major Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs .
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann paid first insights into his farm , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and also houses many young animals , and also houses in five apartments resort guests . &quot;
the &quot; black milk &quot; is for him the altern@@ ate mark@@ eter mark@@ er for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests occurs exclusively region@@ ality .
&quot; since he is also the BL@@ H@@ V Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he signed the Wei@@ gh@@ aun@@ ching project as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I can not be profitable on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the founding area for a lot of work , much m@@ ts can be edited with the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the terms and conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ astic operation and managed without any chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if it does not lead a bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the importance of the Wei@@ mar project , and is pleased with the leader of the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers must be supported . &quot;
we hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be moved still quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thinking about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot;
farmers stand often in criticism because of the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , more than 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the open surface area amounts to 40 hectares , which are not allowed until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total of € 71 , half over Leader was promoted , a quarter carried out the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; thus , they love the farmers 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of Wei@@ ghts . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ rows it does not go . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter white stood firm , &quot; &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot;
the Land@@ sc@@ aling Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg makes the state support of white fence .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
prerequ@@ is@@ ites is the presence of one of the super@@ fic@@ s signed by the L@@ PR .
&quot; moreover , the con@@ stric@@ ting surface may not be conclusi@@ ve ( Hang@@ ing over 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; by 2018 , Wei@@ gh@@ aun@@ ching project 2018 is currently running on the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres from Zau@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the open surface corresponds to 35 hectares , the kal@@ cul@@ ated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
&quot; now , the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
the safest sign of a regime transfer is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the car@@ eless fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad , in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic quar@@ antine with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals by the President to the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
to stay fair , Miller does not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of Bo@@ at@@ owners and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators had gotten him paraly@@ sed if he had done it .
&quot; but he took their significance , and in particular the importance that you have been written , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that the world illuminated . &quot;
&quot; the poem which you refer to , which was later added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is properly properly properly , but as he form@@ ulating it , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the infl@@ amed words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest people , your arms , / your be@@ ver@@ ted masses , which are looking for , free to breathe / the miserable waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time , in which the &quot; el@@ ous waste &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot;
Miller was not involved in liter@@ ary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict in the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who put themselves to place their words after their death at the base - did very good that they have accomplished a high political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republi@@ cans by pointing the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she is himself a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the link of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue , people wanted to withdraw from the right wing this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the big mess@@ enger as Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of Johannes the Bap@@ tist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty doesn &apos;t rede@@ em no one but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atives that bring American flam@@ me into the re@@ bound world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving . &quot;
she is supposed to carry the tor@@ ches of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not supposed to shine the way into the United States .
quite unusual is lim@@ bau@@ gh here on somewhat engra@@ ved .
the significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus insi@@ sted in it to see them as they were seen from the exhausted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travel to the Dec@@ ks of ships was seen . &quot;
&quot; it is about the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people , looking for refu@@ ge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is of course not the perspective , Miller and Tru@@ mp ever wish to recognise . &quot;
&quot; your tor@@ ch is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the way , but the hate , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ ges Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two vill@@ i belonged to the team of Britain .
&quot; the director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ heads @-@ old con@@ federation is to make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; in Scotland &quot; &quot; something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand and we will continue until we find it , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish ath@@ l@@ ete think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish ath@@ l@@ ete are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah during the 5.000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the team to team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is pretty modest .
&quot; your captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the genuine feel , the E@@ ili@@ ie brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth @-@ Silver Medal , who will compete in their fifth world championship with the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 vill@@ i are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which was achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the middle @-@ stream Mu@@ ir leads on this road and has five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metres rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another shot , which one was included in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ yle is reminded of her first World Championships , as the only other Sch@@ otte in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; the teams of capitalists says that they are &quot; &quot; proud &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their land @-@ members are not only part of the team , but in some cases also in the medals and at the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special about team captain &apos;s team is in it that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour , but knowing that my team @-@ mate voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we got .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what my speech is concerned as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship .
&quot; so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it , that we are back at the Olympi@@ astadi@@ on . &quot;
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there .
block from critics about Facebook : be@@ ating you not a public office if you cannot wear the heating of voters
the Father of our land knew something of poor press .
&quot; the American loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers brought him because of everything from the inner policy up to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sho@@ cked in criticism , safely . &quot;
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , du@@ mm , and m@@ ute we shall take the sheep to the battles . &quot;
&quot; it brings me to Maryland to governor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who needs to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ endant him from the beginning of this week .
&quot; the St@@ ab of the Gover@@ nor did the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a return trip with &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is ast@@ o@@ unding .
he has the highest ranking of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary head @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his constitu@@ ents and to debate his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore the block@@ age of individuals come to the site of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum that is considered officially and by collabor@@ ators , which are paid as officially , and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post defended Ho@@ gans spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ator .
&quot; but it is too easy to use the picture of tro@@ lling or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ water @-@ filled people , which sw@@ inging the P@@ eit@@ sche . &quot;
the post talked with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respectful , thought@@ ful , and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor zi@@ pped the Bible in his post and appeal to Ho@@ gans cath@@ olic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked for hate . &quot;
&quot; I commented polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ any and other latest news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the message &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people takes position on the same subject , then they are mis@@ used by some more than such a collective collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected people . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the govern@@ ors are called &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam attack , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ting &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook @-@ era makes it simple , cut a message by blocking a cri@@ tic or a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much clean@@ er than in a past time , if one had done the same that staff were kidn@@ apped to collect newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to burn or burning demonstr@@ ators , and to bring silence . &quot;
but this is exactly what happens .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials that he cri@@ tici@@ zed Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is acc@@ ents by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter &apos;s Fe@@ ed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County is the first A@@ mend@@ ment of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , according to the U.S. District fier James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they were entitled to a vot@@ er of their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky received Gover@@ nor Matt Pri@@ in ( R ) also a visit of the AC@@ ES because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so heavy .
&quot; at the moment of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar impact on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter to his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people , the pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions to critic@@ ise its position on the contract of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with Great Britain critic@@ ised his ministry , according to the historic documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put it to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , differences and disco@@ urses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty will hope in the next three days on domestic comfort , since the Renaissance Club will be held in East Lot@@ hi@@ an the 25 edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led next year on the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the end of the last year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new Australian site and acts as a tournament award in the name of the club @-@ founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his glory with this event , &quot; said Raf@@ fer@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot;
Jerry made a great job than he put this place .
he is an iron advocate of this game and is proud of its performance here .
&quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the England E@@ ales is looking forward to defend the championship for the first time in his 32 @-@ year career as well as the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; it really feels especially important , &quot; said the &quot; &quot; South@@ port &quot; &quot; player . &quot;
&quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as it was last year , after I had won them from the program . &quot;
return to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year to win . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r who came back to the European Senior Tour last year after his 50@@ th birthday .
this event will be its first sch@@ ot@@ tish appearance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
&quot; I really enjoyed playing again , and I have played a solid golf course . &quot;
I am glad you went as far .
&quot; with the trio at the field the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup cap@@ tains Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six car@@ r@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds from Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by pas@@ sports
in the past two decades less people have died because of passive exposure to lung cancer .
&quot; to this result , scientists of the university hospital in Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) come in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates per year 167 lung cancer is attributed to passi@@ vity , &quot; said Study of Hei@@ ko B@@ echer . &quot;

house@@ closures prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and are somewhat less in the period , &quot; thus the head of the Bau@@ mer Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house closures , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground , what does not hide in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which repeatedly hin@@ ders the construction work , represents a big problem for the Bau@@ tr@@ up@@ p of the St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the mot@@ orists in front of red lights and descent is already vast , &quot; reported Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are entitled to travel .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z by the company St@@ ump@@ p have been employed for weeks with working on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already quite ti@@ ring .
&quot; but luckily we were looked by our friend Fritz Matt with cooler mineral water , &quot; tells Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ dina Deg@@ ei coo@@ ks the dinner she does not use stove .
it is rarely used to add a pot .
&quot; in her wood house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the un@@ quiet in@@ don@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the fo@@ al b@@ ool is taken with iron , non @-@ washed hands and dev@@ our@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Deg@@ ree sits on the cl@@ ism - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sum@@ p . &quot;

&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of their man , you were not assigned to any fields . &quot;
Poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late it can be dangerous : most of the village managers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody wo@@ ke it to watch in the village after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 El@@ ders should vote against the occupation forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , turned fast against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds control over the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or legal observations of it . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New gu@@ ine@@ as the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Com@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transport .
&quot; the city with around 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bamboo and dark roofs that were converted by R@@ ust in different yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esian have made their journey here , but journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says Deg@@ ree and points at their lively , bust@@ ling tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is Indon@@ esian &apos;s poorest province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia have . &quot;
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the biggest and profitable gold mine from the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a strongh@@ old of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has built a value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollar gold and copper . &quot;
Pap@@ ua has wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
&quot; however , these rich@@ es are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua who make sure Indon@@ esian military has maintained a profound presence . &quot;
&quot; a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local dairy products has paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anic claims after greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden g@@ ans and become un@@ mer@@ c@@ ably treated .
&quot; according to particulars of activists , more than 500,000 pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as stem @-@ up land in 1970 @-@ 11 years have been presented in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police in the past year more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; we campaign@@ ing all &quot; &quot; in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ bane from the year 2016 , in the reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as un@@ law@@ suits and torture - rape and electro@@ plat@@ ations are particularly popular - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peace demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week occur , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have reinforced themselves as pap@@ u@@ as resources form a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % christ@@ ly , but demo@@ graphic development is changing , since Muslim Economic immigrants come from the populated area of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
Jav@@ anese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ een sell @-@ rats chicken and g@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a ma@@ iled vegetables with pe@@ dic@@ ally . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , who moved to work in the province of Com@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua , the m@@ um Mama &#91; the Women &#93; by Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the folk and as Jo@@ kov@@ i , spoke during his election campaign , to address the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts have broken because we voted in 2014 for Jo@@ kov@@ i with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jeh@@ kow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christ@@ lie@@ der in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the sh@@ ro@@ cking children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took to their sound , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , and sm@@ ote the group with their gar@@ ant@@ ages , spoke sacrifice and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , became so heavy that he fell into the coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was set in fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military mand@@ o@@ center to challenge justice . &quot;
they bore cer@@ em@@ on@@ ial hunting arch and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to beat police and military post @-@ posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot it dead , &quot; it is not released in an official document of T@@ IME , which has not been released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ wning danger and called for peace and called for the amount to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned myself , I suddenly turned into my lin@@ kes hand wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; he said T@@ IME on the veranda of his colorful @-@ painted wood . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame knows still not who has folded , but says that the sphere from the ranks of the soldiers were gathered together . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired &quot; , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the indigenous man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was made three times , so his c@@ ousin , the Wit@@ ness of the sho@@ ots was . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and sear@@ ched his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esian only one name , the T@@ IME in d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the cheer@@ ful@@ ler of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said re@@ por@@ ters that his officers wanted to save her station only &quot; &quot; they wanted to be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people dro@@ us to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others hurt . &quot;
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks of Jo@@ kov@@ i held a passionate speech in Com@@ ap@@ ura , in which he was sympath@@ etic to the families of the victims and vibr@@ ate the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want that this case is immediately resolved , so that in the future it will no longer happen , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; safety sm@@ in@@ Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he had a non @-@ judicial mechanism to establish historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the speeches began almost immediately .
&quot; most injury are performed a long time ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ men and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; the point is that we have oblig@@ ated to address these violations , but there are processes that have to walk through . &quot;
&quot; then W@@ anto made a retreat , when he spoke on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , with T@@ IME and said , he did not submit any plans , in Pap@@ ua to set a complaint . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law . &quot;
&quot; argu@@ ing the UN for crimes against humanity , who demanded more than 1,000 deaths in Ost@@ tim@@ ors bloody Independence @-@ vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua have already been attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to these alleg@@ ations with gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , have fear to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeti@@ tive that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was struck by the military after he was able to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military looked after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting are not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ er@@ ma that refused to bring a mind @-@ free man to hospital , died a person and 17 others were wo@@ unded , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
recently vill@@ agers prot@@ ested before the office office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers stones on officers , who re@@ acted upon it mer@@ ed by warning . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( in@@ don@@ esian param@@ il@@ it@@ ary police ) began to shoot the amount and a sol@@ dered .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witness , as the wo@@ unded here were quickly delivered here , so the T@@ IME . &quot;
&quot; I made me two days in my house hidden . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to account the officers &quot; officials to account and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the chief nation@@ als Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebellion , which claims to defend the rights of the pap@@ ua by having spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of in@@ don@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM guide come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ ya Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to these years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in the last few years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; safeguarding of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place &quot; . &quot; &quot;
poverty rein@@ forces the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as high as range .
people here are building all that they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family when the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces not@@ a cost only 10.000 Indon@@ esian R@@ up@@ iah ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown up since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in larger numbers . &quot;
few jobs that are in the region usually go to the better educated and prosp@@ erous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to lead their own business competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of co @-@ operation with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to films . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , Vice @-@ Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jo@@ kov@@ is campaign to raise awareness of reporting , to promote transparency and development , not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esian in un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure to the Indon@@ esian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific states demanded six Pacific states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ ae and the Sal@@ om@@ ons islands - the UN Human Rights Council , including the &quot; various and widely spread injury &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ ot@@ us . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian State of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed the pre@@ di@@ ties of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to delay the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ amb@@ assador of K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura held on May 4 , the indigenous their silence and be@@ ating him &quot; &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also wants to participate in the session but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not be able to vote for Jo@@ kov@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ kov@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ eme , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the head of the head . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jo@@ kov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a Hebrew military , in alarm for educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jo@@ kov@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; , &quot; which he must with@@ pay . &quot;
&quot; you do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ i led a last symbolic act of the law : the body of a sacrifice was buried on a terrain right opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never come to justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with soci@@ alized head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrapers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential doors of the world in Dubai in its passage , and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ stor@@ ey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is defeated in just two years through the sky@@ scr@@ aper that is called the Tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evac@@ u@@ ated , injury were reported no , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we are up with the light@@ nings and scre@@ ams of the people . &quot;
&quot; we burned down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; told a resident , which named his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais Ci@@ tizenship authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. Local time ( 0@@ 0.00 AM GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooled .
&quot; the government said , they work on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be used for questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scrapers around the world . &quot;
&quot; a study conducted by the management of the tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 y@@ iel@@ ded that the biggest part of the damage caused by the clothes , the out@@ lining for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in Great Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell @-@ Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a loan in June , with about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) is with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal was supported for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two winn@@ ings , hood @-@ thin not supported by the necessary two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; this often very long , but even so much appreciated Five @-@ sentence @-@ classics remain the tradition of tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only slightly mis@@ guided . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these i@@ con@@ ical and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; at all , not only for the vote was before the suggestion , the final decision had already arrived at a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively minor details : the fin@@ alists are in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in future will be the host @-@ right next year in the first round . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the costs for the organizer , the requirements in training courses etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to pass before the Davis Cup less official media dates . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US travelers bring down objects into a plane , finds out a survey . &quot;
&quot; a survey among passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately set up or un@@ aware objects at the check@@ points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration past , including at least 6 percent to fr@@ ying the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally processed kni@@ ves , or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent said , they would have been del@@ ayed that they were travelling wrong with fire@@ arms , am@@ muni@@ tion or explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the survey for more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the STR@@ ATOS Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , performed - presented also , that younger travellers are more ab@@ ided by the rules . &quot;
&quot; from the respon@@ dents , the en@@ cor@@ es that it was kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 per mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items , which were clearly identifiable by T@@ SA agents , were foods and flu@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent said to have kno@@ w@@ ingly worn items with blades by the safety control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of female respon@@ dents , and 3,@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents said that they could have seen untreated drugs into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I have inter@@ viewed travelers across the country to find out how many vers@@ acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gling had brought by the airport security and how many things have done it . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that people , the most sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers - kno@@ w@@ ingly or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - by security wearing , those were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company pointed out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a little complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
&quot; people are often uns@@ afe , which flu@@ ids are allowed to take them or how much of it . &quot;
&quot; so , there is no surprise that the largest quantity of conf@@ isc@@ ated items are conf@@ isc@@ ated by the T@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; a time long thought the people , the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers
e @-@ 1000@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to have a huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; so far , he has so far agreed that a part of the customer has with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the continually tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ant numbers on sales growth and yet gigantic sales aim , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k will bet@@ ray the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly for the first time : the cancell@@ ations in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months Mus@@ k was often applied with the more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , its delivery is just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k Mus@@ k : from the total of 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre @-@ orders have already been with@@ drawn again . &quot;
critics always had pointed out that they are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; during a cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollar and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; completely . &quot;
&quot; at present , 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations from , spatial Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ al@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; that the cancellation of so far around twelve percent of all orders might become a problem , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe . &quot;
its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth aim is not in demand but on the production site .
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles brought out . &quot;
&quot; by 2018 we should be together - all models assembled - 500,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
loud Mus@@ k are currently coming per day 1800 reservations .
&quot; who today ordered a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; should be breakfast in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never in the practice tested production lines without even greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum relief . &quot;
many experts doub@@ ted that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to larger delays , then the non @-@ binding nature of the reservation could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent the company un@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA &apos;s head of Pru@@ d@@ itt withdraw from the rules of the Obama @-@ Era to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after having been poll@@ ed by 15 states , Scott Pru@@ itt said , his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions from smo@@ g @-@ related aircraft . &quot;
Pru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to meet the needs of the state environmental authorities towards re@@ traction @-@ faster than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his previous position in a Federal District Court .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to hold the standards from 2015 for ground floor o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt proclaimed in June , that he will delay the compliance with a year to study the plan and avoid the plan &quot; &quot; move into local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt , who was the prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , a long time ago was a reliable enemy . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , Pru@@ d@@ itt have repeatedly made to block regulations or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden turn from Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the decline of regulatory Roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a federal state court has decided in Washington that the EPA has exceeded its authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ lec@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; in a on Wednesday evening , Pru@@ itt present that his turn @-@ off at Oz@@ on@@ standards is simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under earlier administr@@ ations , the EPA has often been committed to carrying out the deadlines for carrying out and then waited for the execution of activists and others , and in an agreement was indic@@ ted for the carrying out , &quot; said Pru@@ itt , who promised the EPA more than a dozen time in its previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by juris@@ dictions , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority , which there is us serious . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA in the EPA is that Pru@@ d@@ itt eventually use his &quot; &quot; authority for the delay and all the others &quot; &quot; to make sure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ can in Congress are pushing for a broader new version of the o@@ zone .
one last month approved bill is to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made available in the Senate .
&quot; the New York State Department of Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the United States that the EPA had acc@@ ust@@ ed to the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our peti@@ tions - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , who said in their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone is created if poll@@ ut@@ ants made up of cars , power plants , oil plants , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere on sunlight . &quot;
the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious respir@@ atory problems with sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .

&quot; it is worrying how much pressure it needs to get this rational step by the responsible for the protection of air that we inhal@@ e to receive , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government , committed to environmental poll@@ uting and their particular interests . &quot;
Tum@@ ski celeb@@ rates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : at the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area is invited to the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ ah on Sunday , 16 . July , at 16.@@ 30h on a seren@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex , a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth benefit seren@@ ade can be ench@@ anted of this powerful place .
rescue and maintaining the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors for their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stressed : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ f@@ arious pol@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in Wür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ customiz@@ buch &quot; : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with which &quot; &quot; Vog@@ tei &quot; &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard from Hor@@ b and to his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wor@@ ding of the certificate , after the tum@@ our mountain apart from the former parish church also a delightful courtyard , also belonged to the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age law and not the other way round . &quot;
so there was also people there .
&quot; as seen from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the centre of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the glori@@ fied settlers of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 sub@@ trac@@ ts this historical condition .
the pat@@ ron@@ age was created in the early medieval owner .
&quot; one Lord who built a church , married and occupied with a pastor , continued to be owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this owner . &quot;
&quot; thus , the right to use a pastor or propose a new parish priest . &quot;
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells in the tower .
the biggest of the two cr@@ ates to Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created Glo@@ cke was then 16@@ 92 for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window wash@@ ers were pushed and the bell @-@ parts were stolen .
the roof was im@@ dense .
17@@ 96 str@@ ated French troops near the church .
they jour@@ ne@@ yed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church dro@@ ught 18@@ 09 to overthrow .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius Cem@@ et@@ ery served as the last resting place for the dead of hear@@ ers .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ al church was abandoned .
only the church tower had to be left .
in the New Year of 18@@ 34 a storm the church tower and the half rus@@ hed .
&quot; to prevent a mis@@ fortune , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only today still existing tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g stayed as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ mos@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em of the &quot; sheep retired &quot; as successor by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .
&quot; as a sponsor , friends and sponsors invite the tumor on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery on St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the com@@ pler of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words of Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .
the residence of Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 PM .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 PM .
&quot; to the end of the Seren@@ ade , a re@@ trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organis@@ er represent the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only with dry weather .
&quot; the organis@@ er hope many supporters to preserve the historical St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and ear@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
the friends and sponsors are especially oblig@@ ated to the home care as Seren@@ ade Organiz@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affirmed .
the association wants to examine the permission of win@@ eg@@ ro@@ ds
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is not re@@ vered , &quot; does not fores@@ ee the legal basis for the construction and therefore has turned into the countryside . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; is called &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) promp@@ ted to res@@ ign his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval of 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen only on the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal there is a wind force shift zone .
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time causes the concentration zone but a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest area . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had agreed a few days before by a change of the floo@@ ding planning zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but that had not approved the district government Düsseldorf , because of a form of error . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of plan@@ ation legal condition , the author@@ it@@ ative author@@ ess is still illegal and therefore also returned , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current status of things : the city council entered again the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , a approval of the district government . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; this makes it impossible for the creation of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received since last week in the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; said a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to consider the matter once again .
but they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Board of Directors , the Circle himself wanted to express itself in content with the argum@@ entation of the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area on the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette construction of four per 200 meters high win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company had participated in which the city of Vier@@ sen is involved , P@@ eight@@ ened agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land closed . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electric power needs to be covered by some 11 400 households - that is equivalent to one @-@ fifth of the electricity requirements of all quad@@ rant households . &quot;
the NEW Re intends to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Three @-@ sens City announced green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor cr@@ ashes together : woman dies in an aw@@ ful accident
one terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ n@@ men@@ au and B@@ bird ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ circle ) .
a woman was in@@ ju@@ red .
two other people were easily wo@@ unded .
the national road remained locked over hours .
&quot; according to police statements , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with their truck in the frame of the accompanying ride with her 53 @-@ year mother as an accompanying person the L 333 in the direction of the bird . &quot;
town and dealers plan &quot; Home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city in September .
&quot; the commercial organisation and local authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on August 8th and 9th , to attract the local residents for the shopping stroll into the city center . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the profession , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home &quot; Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; weekend is to raise the customer to raise the own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ product . &quot;
&quot; according to this , there is a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre should invite to the &quot; &quot; midnight &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the action will not only provide residents of the city and the surrounding region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian King . &quot;
municipal authorities and commercial association cooperate with the industrial and Chamber of Commerce .
this makes the wareh@@ ouses and the city into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre . &quot;
&quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; with the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; and sell Sunday , talks with all business adverti@@ sers and hosts to take them into active participation . &quot;
&quot; also attractive offers on Saturday and Ver@@ zi@@ cht on Park@@ charges on this day are part of the concept . &quot;
&quot; in addition , customer potential can be new or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
&quot; but also many locals , the city center would have lost sight of shopping . &quot;
&quot; in the end , all would have to contribute to the city center - to land@@ lords , the factories around the city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it sm@@ s to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , which made himself partly in spring , had said the king in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Strei@@ ch , leader of the Chamber of the Chamber of Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen agreed that the former &quot; &quot; home Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; day , for the first time five Thur@@ ingi@@ an towns . &quot;
&quot; beside Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day was to promote the appreciation of local trade and make its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; Strei@@ ch . &quot;
the action on the Chamber of Chamber of I@@ HK and with many partners also make clear that every citizen would have to influence his direct environment themselves .
two T@@ ote and several last to an explosion at US school
during construction it came to a gas bar in the school building .
new further people have been wo@@ unded .
&quot; in a gas tu@@ bs in the U.S. city of Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine further wo@@ unded , some of them were difficult . &quot;

&quot; at the dead , it was a lawyer of the school . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ fortunate , the authorities suspected works at a gas manual . &quot;

Tru@@ mp set out for tran@@ sit@@ ed tran@@ scription by phone call Mexico under pressure due to payment of the border .
tran@@ scription by telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and Leadership from Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tru@@ mp in a telephone call with the Mexican president En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , listen to publicly declar@@ ing that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President accused him , because he had bound the wall publicly . report , he said to him , &quot; This can not tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ am , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first anal with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .

mo@@ ores Ford @-@ mass@@ acre : activists leading rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury went through a group of spect@@ ators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ inking to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came forth with gun to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ing suit - took a long train to his cigarette and looked after the wind@@ shield .
inside c@@ urs@@ ed the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; brood &quot; &quot; of the man . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; scre@@ aming the silence , as a young black man was distor@@ ted from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; luckily this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , only a night position . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop around the neck by &quot; Roger , &quot; was thrown out , almost all in the audience very real sig@@ h . &quot;
since 2005 they come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - from the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been charged on the murder .
&quot; it truly is in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congreg@@ ations , though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in the organisation of re@@ organization . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt road on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ old former congress of the state of Georgia and a life long citizen .
&quot; for him , the position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe community that any injustice never has been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal proceedings , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot go to healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a bed to@@ wel served a bed to@@ wel on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI acts , which were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding County were suspected . &quot;
but no one has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot for decades , citizenship say that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 he made a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of the black citizens in Georgia , for the first time , in the summer off their voice in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the choice after the F@@ BI by the F@@ BI , Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle down - alleg@@ edly because of a woman . &quot;
Bro@@ oks said the ru@@ mor in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby he carried her , not by her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when she went away from the prison , and the mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , surrounded by a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b , the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ de , and closes it from a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a complete link between state and local criminal proceedings , which was not only involved in the mort@@ ality , evidence , and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even better .
&quot; it was a voting right @-@ mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and when you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade long cass@@ ette Gre@@ ene led the annual re@@ vocation of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their representation is vi@@ vid , in@@ comprehen@@ sible and is justified in a kind of deep racism that many believe in America , no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to look for , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we will then face with its ur@@ gency in all of us , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - into a room and lou@@ der , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the Chief C@@ lan@@ a gli@@ eds for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so &quot; , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story on life , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester , and pus@@ hes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , w@@ asting by my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ dert the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs in the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always cold . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people then have said &apos; n --- &apos; .
&quot; but , we@@ ath@@ ered one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you just have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly there is the energy in space , a sense of compani@@ onship , replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing it right , not only because of the game but also because of memory of the four sol@@ dered people . &quot;
the scene begins even once .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona the N word says , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed with a dream dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays mo@@ urn Lob@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it there is a group of about four dozen spect@@ ators swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost even@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , usually to see the performance , many come just down the road . &quot;
they all have been experienced for almost eight hours of Georgia when Bro@@ oks carries her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point the Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de has occurred , the air feels up@@ loaded . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to insp@@ ect the cor@@ p@@ name . &quot;
children ho@@ cken in their minds to register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ ants a little boy , as wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors take away the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l and sore their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ ned Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who has played the cl@@ one . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona ar@@ ded two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks together into her arms , the emotional burden of performance breaks off with him finally through . &quot;
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per one of the women . &quot;
we know that that is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience will get together with the actors for dinner together .
at a table a white couple from Atlanta stimul@@ ated over the re@@ union with a black pair they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought about finding words which left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like yourself and do what they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ chen still continues to go , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
&quot; he said , he already started to plan the performance in the next year . &quot;
&quot; the conclusion is in some way inspir@@ ational , for it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so if we learn nothing , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story is do@@ omed to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Gods &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work works director Frank Cast@@ orf on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e Ins@@ ulation in front of gigantic , six @-@ stor@@ ey scenery . &quot;

&quot; Gest@@ apo Stri@@ pes , remember@@ ing Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - which draws itself through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhin@@ eland - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ieren as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;

the audience would like to thank the ensemble with skilled appl@@ ause .

large appl@@ ause is available for the festival orchestra which shows the first time on stage - given the great heat again in legal fun .
&quot; with excitement , the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf was expected and its Regi@@ ete@@ am . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a gell@@ on @-@ concert over itself , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; Ru@@ fe under@@ went . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have enjoyed it .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown with the &quot; Ring &quot; in some ways , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also has grown an understanding of its view . &quot;
I get a positive res@@ ale .
Max number works as volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several places .

&quot; I have known for me , that it is true for me and I want to do something different , with people working . &quot;
and then I asked me what do you make .
&quot; a social year , as there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the point of burning maybe , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester at the winter term .
&quot; I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t H@@ erne a social @-@ job training and study in Ham@@ m at Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not something unusual during the volunteer service to have several different applications ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it &apos;s probably always on how to make his F@@ S@@ J .
it can work from anti@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social labour .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that has taken me off .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really exp@@ ires .
unlike in the building of engineering ?
&quot; quantity : well , here it is not about to count st@@ ati@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people vor@@ m head , which each have a very different story behind . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been fet@@ ched out of the family - you must always go out individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have a touch ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
there is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that life is life . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son abbrevi@@ ated more 3,000 jobs and abbrevi@@ ated the divi@@ dend to re@@ v@@ ital@@ ise the business &quot;

Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in self @-@ mur@@ ders
&quot; a self @-@ mur@@ derer has attacked a military con@@ vo@@ i in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of the N@@ ato and had several others in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were hurt , shared a statement by the N@@ ato . &quot;
&quot; confirmed local reports , according to the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also three civilians . &quot;
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday were more than 30 people killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday there is a self @-@ ord@@ att@@ ed two people near the Iraqi message in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of the N@@ ato , it means that an explosion on Thursday night was done when a common pat@@ rol by the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; worn &quot; &quot; com@@ missions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the statement says that all the last in a stable state are in a stable state , and treated in the U.S. military hospital at the field of Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , which is known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan , in the first half of 2017 there was at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian population offering of about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
at the end of July a su@@ ic@@ ide @-@ Autob@@ om@@ be at least 30 people in the mainly schi@@ i@@ tic district of Kab@@ ul .
&quot; the Taliban said , they had done this attack . &quot;
&quot; on 31 May there is a huge bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops 2001 the Taliban from power . &quot;

&quot; correspon@@ dents said that self @-@ ordin@@ ates in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns the decision to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule to charges
&quot; the US @-@ American environmental protection authorities has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , wai@@ ve that the states are inde@@ b@@ ted to def@@ ying the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 countries def@@ endants the Agency due to the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance so called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ment 2015 &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the agency , with states to work . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and believe that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA @-@ chief Scott Pru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt said the EPA in June , the intention of EPA in which to be measured in part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions in order to set up where inc@@ isions are to be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , handed over to Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to withdraw a wide range of environmental issues , which the former president Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth , according to Tru@@ mp &apos;s economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have triggered the back of democr@@ ats and conservation groups which worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function &quot; and can increase the breath@@ able symptoms &quot; as for example as@@ thma . &quot;
community wants to be communal space
&quot; in the end , the decision was obvious : with two counter@@ parts of the community of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln , the establishment of a communal space in the future elderly people . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing land section was signed , reported Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it will still take until the so far the church community belonging to the church is owned , but there is now no plans for planning for making a private investor to st@@ em@@ ming project more . &quot;
there is a discussion regarding a communal space .
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered the church to meet . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters and an adjacent terrace with all 70 square meters of space available for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council acts committed to watch such a common room as a meeting place just for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ ent residen@@ cy , but open to the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word of &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot;
&quot; it will fail the decision that has been decided by providing funds for the ongoing budget in the past autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a communal space would be , so reported T@@ j@@ ads , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed resolution looks to sign@@ post to the investor that one wants to throw him in this regard no bill@@ ets between the legs , the conclusion that both Se@@ at@@ - - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which is reduced to the high@@ ways and the construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so do not only mean Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this supplement . &quot;
when &apos;s helps : unanim@@ ously happens he happens to the body .
it is not that easy when it comes to communal space .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings with which you do not come right now with the common room from the window , she says , &quot; I do it hard with it . &quot;
Yvonne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it looks behind it a cover sub@@ missions in any case of any illegal or non @-@ foreign investors .
&quot; that is not so , because with the purchase of the surface you give no grant , but I get a real , in a branch of doubt , is the object . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , to keep the decision according to the decision , finds three supporters . &quot;
&quot; it remains in two counter@@ parts to the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller so sum@@ mar@@ ised : &quot; &quot; if we write the decision so we make a huge step into our infrastructure . &quot;

that was last not good . &quot;
&quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an increase of performance in the first official mandatory game of the season . &quot;

in the Har@@ z from Stern to Stern
&quot; in the Har@@ z the nation@@ wide &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; is supposed to be developed . &quot;
this plans of the association Stern@@ bergs Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
&quot; a planetary path , there is in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star &quot; &quot; coming to the information in need of many Har@@ z@@ ai@@ cher , was called it . &quot;
&quot; he connecting nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
members want to exhibit the members along the planned route and inform on stars and stars .
&quot; during the first phase until 2018 , the association is planning to reach five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber &quot;
the information on the boards should be added via the Internet .
&quot; therefore , in the sit@@ ing @-@ selection , a good mobile network reception plays a role . &quot;
also Acces@@ sibility is a crit@@ erion .
&quot; later , the star@@ ring path should be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path , the vie@@ wers experience much knowledge @-@ value , for example above the physics of the single stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition they learned , why stars should have different colors or why a star has more lumin@@ aire than another , although it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; it will also be convey@@ ed , in which constell@@ ation is a sel@@ ectable star , and when he was best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been working in the Berg@@ städ@@ t St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is located at the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 . &quot;
the location in the middle of the National Park of Har@@ z is according to the Federal Minister for Natur@@ schutz to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently they are from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with blo@@ wn eye clearly visible .
&quot; in the university city since 2003 , there have been some simil@@ arity on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen , such as the planned stars . &quot;
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ all@@ ee , the interior of our solar system , is the planetary path leading up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( municipality ) with the planet S@@ edn@@ a . &quot;
the ri@@ mp@@ s with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ dedicated Pl@@ uto at the end point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth is shr@@ inking thus to a sphere of 6,@@ 5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the exact 75 meters away is about 70 cen@@ timeters . &quot;
the entire distance of the plan is about four kilometers .
&quot; for the light of sun up to Pl@@ uto , about eight hours , we need a good hour to St@@ ele with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
ped@@ est@@ ri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fix@@ tures but would last a half year .

&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a coll@@ isions in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;

&quot; as the couple designed for photographs , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; &quot; perfect size order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I have risen to Bron@@ ers &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to go down to light weight .
&quot; and he has to move into Light@@ weights &#91; 135 &#93; , and then we fight . &quot;
they demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;

&quot; this struggle could take place in Pay @-@ via @-@ View mode , because all fans were asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and pressing themselves openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;

no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he este@@ emed Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; a huge fighter &quot; , &quot; and he might take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;

four wo@@ unded to ty@@ re
an accident on the A7 was severely in@@ ju@@ red by an accident on the A7 .
&quot; after the first information , the driver of Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost shortly before the junction market size and probably after a tire space of control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ looked , and then lying on the roof in the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ STRE@@ IF@@ EN . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely in@@ ju@@ red during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the last through the b@@ ail@@ out service , the A7 was locked in direction to the north for about an hour , then the traffic could pass on the left lane at the in@@ genu@@ ity . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoff@@ mann : &quot; Trinity works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoff@@ mann ho@@ ists after the 2 : 2 to the end of the season against Br@@ uns@@ wick , that the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points will bring . &quot;
&quot; with the first season , Andre Hoff@@ mann was satisfied , with the result also , would not have been the two oppos@@ ers at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ers too much , and we have to fit in au@@ me even better , &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Ore Mountains the triple chain is supposed to be further optimized .
and a gate after a cl@@ ash want to catch the For@@ tun@@ es even more .
for the future it will be so that no more next to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) turns to the line .
Hoff@@ mann is convinced that his team is better to cope with the experiences in preparation with the tri@@ ke chain as with the quad@@ rant chain .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach of Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoff@@ mann is his cause for sure , &quot; because we have just been able to build the semi @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ found@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ condition is , but that we do not harmon@@ ise even better and we do not do so much error . &quot;
&quot; of course also drives Hoff@@ mann to Au@@ e , to win the game . &quot;
&quot; whether you can speak after a Draw from a mis@@ leading start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the achievement could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can focus on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to talk of a neat season . &quot;
of which his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start in the season I had only after six to eight game days , &quot; &quot; Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak from an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim pre@@ matur@@ ely had to be broken because of an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoff@@ mann believes that the players from Au@@ e might be even something fresh , since they could have no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a as@@ cen@@ sion to the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % process where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; while the guests come from the Rhin@@ eland as an easy Favor@@ it on Sunday to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six@@ es , is bl@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is at only a defeat for Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there are no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which one must hit from the outset , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chef@@ coach . &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement , arrogan@@ t and Hebrew . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no way .
new results of Swedish asylum application tests published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of people tested were older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for for@@ ensi@@ c medicine ( puzzles ) has started carrying out the tests last year .
&quot; they should make the assessment of the age more accurately during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration authority ( migrants ) because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees was critic@@ ised the inf@@ eri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; until today , it has been sending migration to 6,@@ 8@@ 80 and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eight@@ y percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in more 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency assessed that the person has been 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 432 , cases the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the person has questioned the person .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results in recent months have been resistant . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of last months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the Local journal The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged as more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has turned over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the inf@@ alli@@ ed person 18 years or older be . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det made the 5@@ 81 published results , she asked that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that they will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age evaluation , in the x @-@ rays of wheat @-@ teeth and MR@@ T recordings are made by knee br@@ akes , which then analyses of dentists and radi@@ ologist , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
&quot; if we cannot say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency acts however the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general they can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is in it if the person is just under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy emphasis was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , buil@@ ders at the department of street and traffic in the government of the government of Freiburg . &quot;
in April the works started at all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ts bridge from concrete , bo@@ died with red Bun@@ ts@@ ar@@ stein , and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , she has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings will now be thoroughly re@@ constructed . &quot;
the two other bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning at the north side a 1,30 meter width and seven tons of heavy so called Br@@ ück@@ appe .
this is a random attachment that is also used as an operating path .
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , the bridge is scheduled to be put on Friday a three @-@ meter cap on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian path should go away .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about manufacturing , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ ver@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges already provided with the patented lo@@ ops .
a special f@@ inger@@ sense @-@ feeling has the pl@@ edges of power lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass fiber cable , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed about the project prior to work by hand@@ z@@ ett@@ el .
&quot; moreover , first fish and cancer had to be demol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building building and the collecting in direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is controlled by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher local entrance , the road is locked in the area of the bridge at the level of the &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the total cost of the three rolls are 700 000 euros .
financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest at German potato salad
&quot; it is not so frequent to pull parties to a string , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is hard to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties in the Krei@@ day volcan@@ ic representatives ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell to the &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ L@@ ers , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place at the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ale - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event . &quot;
a colour@@ ful picture that offers itself there .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , really happy : &quot; &quot; great , how many people have come here together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police has seen many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the train station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcano ei@@ fel reports that he has tried to make such an event and get a supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there is a cancellation , because because of the already built @-@ built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes does not have enough parking places . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : at 8 pm , at the reception center a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ erian Af@@ D @-@ president Uwe boy . &quot;
&quot; in the hall are about 200 listen@@ ers who are waiting for the leading can@@ did@@ atin for the Bundestag elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; somewhat more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short after 21 o &apos;clock o@@ aming . &quot;
the police cannot move - no special benefits .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ listening with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the row of Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ ster@@ Group tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he is a concert under the motto &quot; Schwarz@@ meer hits &quot; &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ ald &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ ers &quot; &quot; to a classical German education with roots in the brass music . &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ opo@@ si@@ ections in European top @-@ level spre@@ ader .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ s at the renowned Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ay the SWR Symphony .
&quot; both are united to cross the limits on its instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; it sounds Johann Sebastian Bach at the two as in a new thread , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ her@@ row N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram , mix classical , jazz and the free games to a fascinating overall art . &quot;
this core part of the program was performed only this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the prestigious composer N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram has written it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with their particular acou@@ sti@@ cs are deliberately included into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art speaks about her Bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I would like to try out everything , so Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art quite openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual rule . &quot;
&quot; when I put aside in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what is coming as a neighbour ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known relationship of the Holl@@ y@@ man stars was the &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately did bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all the in@@ sured the br@@ ün@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ er opposite the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with I . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten gave them that it was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never confused or hin@@ dered .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them , they did according to &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; but in school days when they prefer like a be@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really felt very in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a be@@ b . &quot;
I felt really attacked and damaged and damaged .
&quot; I look back and think , &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t like to love their love @-@ life : &quot; people expect you to judge yourself in a certain way and the angry me .
&quot; and perhaps some call me un@@ think@@ able , but I don &apos;t like it to justify myself before all the public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tru@@ mp , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; if you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed himself from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking about ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the r@@ ally broke in che@@ ers .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the republi@@ cans , &quot; he added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it is at the time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised a great announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice approved not the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes represents that he possesses carbon em@@ inen in five states , and inherited a carbon @-@ store by his father . &quot;
it is worth about $ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; meanwhile , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening gave a statement on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather prevent us to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 gu@@ ill@@ ings and the control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice , the last rejection of a party which is from above to below without a guidance and is unable to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; hon@@ orary &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the worldwide leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , what he described as an open ap@@ ologies from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal but he repeated , unless the moment for the country to be taken back in sports . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics chief Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin talks during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of his country from the sport , and that he is determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said it was p@@ ity for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were carved from competitions and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the For@@ bidden , which was published in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) was found in nation@@ ally funded D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was today a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the re@@ por@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that Russian Federation has experienced itself , that she experienced some rather hot times and everything can be done to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e said , he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
&quot; the chief of IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia will still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; Dro@@ gent@@ ests were still inadequate and toler@@ ated Trainer are still free , he said re@@ por@@ ters in London after a presentation at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;

&quot; with a grape @-@ party in the North @-@ H@@ itz@@ an Fr@@ itz@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two were thought of a helic@@ opter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .

they described the two transform@@ ers pil@@ ots but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner &apos;s her professional . &quot;
&quot; we are afraid of this highest victim , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; declared it . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ round major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ cat@@ er@@ pillar of Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life on Wednesday before a week in the West African Mali .
their sne@@ er were transferred to Germany and ac@@ companies on Thursday accompanied by a dead house of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
&quot; at the mid@@ day , only the relatives were at the church goodbye . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral party began in the circle of family , narro@@ wer friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
below were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General Secretary @-@ Chief of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; grape bun@@ ni@@ es placed ros@@ es , the relatives were poor in arms in the hands . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Secretary of Defense of the &quot; &quot; Ley@@ en &quot; &quot; drew the back@@ rest soldiers as a &quot; highly decorated &quot; and broke . &quot;

&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ur des Reg@@ iment to which the soldiers said , &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , then it would not have missed . &quot;
&quot; no doubt to the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of the Ley@@ en did not : the use is dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; for a country , by which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral party the shar@@ pen@@ ises were brought from the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not cause any information . &quot;
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried in his wife next to his wife . &quot;

&quot; the Queen be agreed with the decision of her husband , was it continued to be in the press release . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik buried , is still unclear . &quot;
but he did not have the intention of being set aside in his French homeland .
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik never made a job that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
in 2016 he went to retirement and also places the title &quot; prin@@ cess . &quot;
&quot; Hen@@ rik in Denmark won &apos;t get the title and the function he wanted to see himself as equal to his wife - also not after death , L@@ ene Ball@@ eby , the Chief of the Danish King &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not have the intention of being set aside in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the past 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ ocr@@ at , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the River Thames in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people had always escap@@ ed , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his just 50 @-@ year regime . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival was everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was swe@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , Seiden@@ str@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itted , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the pal@@ lo@@ ises I smoke instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and who had the reputation to be soci@@ alistic intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for confidence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ash@@ amed of me .
these were the same two bugs ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; tie @-@ out Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) is after the loss of red @-@ green registr@@ ar for a swift re @-@ election of the country , he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday , the Parliament spoke for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
previously the surprise of a green MPs from their country @-@ crowd in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a heavy crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the day @-@ day election the red @-@ green coalition lost in Hannover to its scar@@ ce one @-@ votes majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Gre@@ ens MEP El@@ ke T@@ ables established their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election in their election in Rot@@ enburg ( Des@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ ench@@ sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler would recommend to his faction to take it up .
&quot; so , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have together 69 seats in the Lower Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was reverse .
the new Land@@ tag will be re @-@ elected to the 14th of January of the coming year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they could gover@@ n in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l is however indispensable for the fact that the tag decides as quickly as its self @-@ resolution , as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; the state of the country also sees the possibility that the country @-@ president cho@@ oses the trust , and a successor to the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be legally examined , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; you will be deb@@ ated in peace and quiet , if it is legally reasonable . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens &quot; &quot; but somewhat kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I stressed : &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
it describes itself as a singer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens also called for the Ab@@ sen@@ ing Euro for the return of her country @-@ meeting .
&quot; of course we assume that she has received her country @-@ day , which she has received across the green country , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; shared Met@@ a J@@ ans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; We deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ acks . &quot;
you have decided not to do any foreign language in the faction .
&quot; even before the background , there were no major differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD @-@ pul@@ ch@@ erk@@ an@@ did@@ at Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the crossing of the Gre@@ ens of Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ ables for CD@@ U as a betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behavior of the former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al at the elect@@ or@@ ers and voters , but also betra@@ y@@ al on red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the German Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he sponsor the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the tag .
the resign@@ ation t@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; in her last erup@@ tion and in her frustration , her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; cri@@ tici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal made that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony has been doing this dirty example and tries to strike it in political capital .
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ ench@@ sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler would recommend his MEPs to include El@@ ke T@@ ug@@ in to the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , cast t@@ int@@ ages before , with personality career in the outcome of the country @-@ election in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time before the SPD strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a hau@@ ling majority of a voice in the country . &quot;
&quot; agricultural Minister in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ener , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses about se@@ perate eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
land@@ Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect yourself from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
&quot; I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumers to look carefully and check the eggs in your fridge , and to check the stamp . &quot;
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ .com , the Bundes@@ länder represent the latest information on the affected eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all we currently know , a health haz@@ ard practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; does Al@@ di assume the best possible crisis action , all eggs are out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier of the Federal Minister is not really perceived ? &quot;
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off immediately and has been in close cooperation with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; trade has just as much as the manufacturers to bear care , that the sold @-@ selling products are busi@@ ly and health@@ ful harmless . &quot;
&quot; if in eggs of the back@@ level content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not easy . &quot;
&quot; un@@ contaminated eggs , however , can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time not the operations to blame .
do operations and consumers are sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; after the present day , the production facilities are not an immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must count on illeg@@ ally illegal practices of services related to economic damages . &quot;
as always there is in the seri@@ ousness to little control .
is it only missing on the staff or also at the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , there were just the official controls that have revealed the procedure . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth was also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be eliminated to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; precisely because of this , a consistent education of such events and the commit to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s pro@@ secution in the cases where criminal off@@ ences may be of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; I have already made many times a number of times , that I expect from the responsible authorities for a consistent education . &quot;
is the regular alarm for food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer rights and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and convenient food exclusively .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de in the food sector is used , consumer and consumer are un@@ heard . &quot;
&quot; due to the ground@@ ed means , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cides Fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in attitude of life @-@ cooked animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
it is necessary to work on all levels and work with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact is going to grow quickly and seam@@ lessly .
how to operate the financial rules of football to N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ve to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to avoid un@@ interrupted issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord @-@ transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A yet , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has control the power , teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair @-@ play rules , which were created by the UEF@@ A into life , mean that PS@@ G has to point out at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid € 222 million Euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make up security the money , so N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ writes and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich Herr@@ scher@@ family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may apply to a lot of money to purchase players , but need to deal with legitimate income sources that allow them to be the Bre@@ ak @-@ E@@ ven point in their on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that associations , who had massive enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and risky to ruin if banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P declined from concentration on the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested in order to build the crew and build a global brand - a tough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P pre@@ disposition period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ bl@@ ade , his UEF@@ A @-@ successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to make off excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will determine the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for b@@ illing over the duration of his contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year agreement so that the Abl@@ ation can be used for the next five years at the amount of 44,@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has made the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G has received a total of 60 million Euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members of the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of which otherwise normal 25 players remain limited . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is searching for clubs that might try to over@@ look their financial perspectives by providing their revenue by companies , which are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company could lead to the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not apply this as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; it was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsorship of the P@@ SA was paraly@@ sed by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar about payments of the World Championship of the World Cup 2022 could come in Qatar .
&quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have been disp@@ uted , that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will be considered and such a lack of maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could simply be out . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more careful , any attempt to consider the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepared talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , say on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
&quot; the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros , with a turnover of more than 10 million euros . &quot;
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and trig@@ gers . &quot;
the Association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise .
&quot; the Spanish League has definitely been ir@@ ted to see one of the best soccer player , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s way@@ point by asser@@ ting that PS@@ G would hurt FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financing dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily newspaper in terms of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a State administ@@ ered an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner , and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play , because you have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic for the glorious day of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year &apos;s gr@@ unge term ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter the Sk@@ etch @-@ com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV turned ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to greater things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
&quot; but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would like . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original history for a speaking oc@@ ose vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by turning itself at the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle ages , vacc@@ inated children who will grow - manage them nonetheless the im@@ possibility to reg@@ ain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years of L@@ ater , &quot; with its adults who are now playing adults , is less emotional pro@@ oted and its par@@ ody goes more to the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ he years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks of the Cr@@ adle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that looked the cradle ) . &quot;
&quot; on one point , a character finds a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;

and there is another crazy p@@ ign@@ ant P@@ lot in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the ex@@ classes are the best part of fran@@ chise .
&quot; it is especially good fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ illons under@@ li@@ plate of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could show this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieved this , what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ ET Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; whose last scene will show the gang &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;

blow against Dru@@ m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow to the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar @-@ district , in Rot@@ sel@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as well as the pro@@ secution of Con@@ stance on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 15 , 15 accused of the age of 25 have been arrested and 77 years ago and have been put to arrest warran@@ t this arrest warran@@ t . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the officials killed bigger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundreds of thousands of Euros . &quot;
&quot; at the time , two people were arrested in Italy . &quot;
against the two susp@@ ects there were German arres@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably shipped to Germany .
at the action we were involved in the Italian and Bay@@ erische Staats@@ investig@@ ators .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were used . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia will be accused of drug crime , and serious violence , were accused of murder , as well as rob@@ bery and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor has been established against the organised drug trading in the South German area . &quot;
&quot; between the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Con@@ stance and Palermo , a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the grand@@ use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , especially Italian national , with respect to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; also a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , det@@ ained in a guest house early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account of the Ban@@ de . &quot;
way lam@@ ents big gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ Register
&quot; data from citizens who ought not to emerge &quot; : &quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner @-@ Register in Germany indicates significant shortcomings . &quot;
the lead to some of serious mis@@ represent@@ ations in asylum @-@ procedures .
&quot; the representative for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen , has made aware of a media report according to large gaps in the country @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the registered data could lead to asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; war@@ ned in an analysis that &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the Register , the data is estimated that ten million people with foreign nationality , including about 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts so far has not been good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer in life , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer arise in the Register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inser@@ tions can greatly slow down , the report is following the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics about full @-@ paying people , the EU citizens are captured that they would not have to travel out . &quot;
&quot; but such a false en@@ act@@ ations led &quot; &quot; to a distor@@ ting debate on dealing with ex@@ tru@@ thful &quot; , &quot; it is therefore in analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began to send refugee families with less than 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they come from there . &quot;
&quot; drawing from an internal paper of the Bundes@@ am@@ ts for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ norm@@ er Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , the BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - after Italy since 1 June 2017 , again . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees from the EU state . &quot;
&quot; if a Mig@@ rant is to reach another EU country , this state can send it back to a single country . &quot;
&quot; for reason , the office is now writing : &quot; the recording capacity for families with inf@@ eri@@ ous children in Italy significantly increased . &quot;
Italy have made guarantees for inclusion and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) consider these commitments for adequate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also other EU states would withdraw refugees within the Dublin agreement . &quot;
&quot; the inner political speaker of the Lin@@ ks@@ fr@@ action in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ ught because of the lack in the Italian asylum system of human rights conditions , and an threat to the child . &quot;
second result achieved

&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , which were presented on Friday . &quot;

&quot; a single blood @-@ saving helps more people , explained the pro@@ vision@@ ary director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves are disp@@ uted into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
this is how three people could benefit from a blood pressure .
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported by the actions performed in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 sp@@ ans the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ Kreis@@ leader . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change in the theatre has led to higher number of participants from a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ n , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ beer for the multi @-@ specialists and have been awarded for 50 minutes each time . &quot;

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
Bank of England will likely be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation took the spec@@ ulation over a rise .
&quot; the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth &quot; &quot; ields &quot; &quot; will remain , when they retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened print . &quot;
&quot; the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates on 0,25 % , whereas the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.1 % and for 2018 on 1.6 % and war@@ ned that the pressure on the household income would continue , whereby inflation in autumn is expected to rise in almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years of zinc @-@ caves would be necessary to grow up by the Bre@@ xit , and they said that the l@@ ending costs may possibly increase more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also voted to retreat a part of the mam@@ mot@@ h economy stand , which was issued before a year after Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for finance plan to provide financial incentives for banks , even though it is expected to ensure that she is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of Ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the reality of households continues to be deb@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; interest rates repeated , that &quot; a certain tight@@ ening of monetary policy &quot; has been required for cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent than the markets are expected . &quot;
markets forecast for the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are pre@@ valent in comparison to the 1,@@ 9 % and 1.1 % . &quot;
it has maintained its growth progn@@ osis to 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the Po@@ unds fell after those news from the dollar and the euro .
the Po@@ und fell around 0.5 % at the end of the US dollar and fell to 0,@@ 4 % to 1.11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ continued growth pay the rising expectations on a Zin@@ c ca@@ vities and GDP in the second quarter of 0.7 % in the previous three months increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth will be expected at 0.7 % in the third quarter even though it will be easily recover after the bank at the end of the year .
&quot; the most recent In@@ fl@@ ation@@ Report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by a rising inflation and low sal@@ aries , since the tight@@ ening first is still worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years can not prevent the income in the coming years , but she added that wages to the end of their three @-@ year &apos;s pre@@ diction is clearly to recover . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound rather than a part of the lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes from a year after lowering the interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the S@@ ham of the P@@ act .
the Bank appreci@@ ates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the last Jud@@ gement of the Bank to the interest rates , the call was increased by an end @-@ rate , since inflation increased the pressure on hard be@@ ating households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has declined in the last month of 2.9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and they will go again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the exc@@ eeding in relation to its aim of 2 % is &quot; entirely &quot; to the weak l@@ apping .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; &quot; given the recent return of S@@ wap arrangements , the mort@@ gage market is expected to be more competitive again , since the len@@ ders would like to look lou@@ dly to stores and want to finish the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those who complete the existing De@@ als and take out the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rein@@ forces are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to write more controversial HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people &quot;
patients will be obtained from September after a fight against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one before intercourse income prevention of prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the infection risks to approximately 86 per cent , now provided by healthcare services on a first three @-@ annual study for more than 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Court of Justice had confirmed the verdi@@ ct of the Supreme Court of Justice in which the N@@ HS had the authority , for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; announced on Thursday announced by N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) this was the &quot; decisive moment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bright@@ on , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the First who will allow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October 2018 . &quot;
prevention of prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces the HIV transmission of infection .
pre@@ p before the intercourse means taking enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so two hours before the intercourse .
&quot; for those who are coming into question , include pregnant or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners that have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , appropriate participants are identified to agree on the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a doctor &apos;s physician may also opt for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
&quot; the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England , signed a contract for delivery of the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement . &quot;
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p to be collected and implemented in large scale , as it is implemented in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for prevention of HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when it is targeted towards vulnerable and vulnerable people , the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS financing attempt to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not with a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now lie that the study is quickly done throughout the country and that no one that has left the risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p testing treatment was taken , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow of Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation through the government . &quot;
the evidence show how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life alter@@ ation infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; it is important now that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the end of the spreading of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and cl@@ ever@@ e designers tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court flat into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , built in 2014 from a large house in K@@ night@@ s@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not packs their bags and sold .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in K@@ night@@ s@@ bridge in a much larger area , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I looked after something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
&quot; I loved her in love and made an offer on this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square kilometres was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a wast@@ ed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne Stau@@ room and a mezzanine , to provide the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; to this end she announced the architectural and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms covered with each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted to create a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the pre @-@ giving .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ works is rather complicated , &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were covered with each other , without having had to know us . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about to build a simple platform , but the steel so that he had the proper height for the function above or at the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this order was allowed to place a fan , place two spaces in full height - with plenty of additional drama . &quot;
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic coupl@@ ing window from Retro@@ u@@ vi@@ us is down over the gl@@ am@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver @-@ silver and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
on both ends a short cor@@ ridor mir@@ r@@ ored to let him last longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we have mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all the seating area and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of living room can ex@@ clude the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a wardrobe .
&quot; a bit of box@@ ing art went out , &quot; says Er@@ fan from the st@@ ahl@@ strengthened , fright@@ ened M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is rather important , so it &apos;s when you push the door very easily gli@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the cl@@ ever@@ ly use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne could win extra 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basic space - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate @-@ mak@@ ler will enter and make a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the ground floor , while maintaining high quality materials that gives space to its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not ad@@ orable you into the electric plugs at the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be turned out by a good design and increased square metres from a standard into something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollars .
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dyn@@ asty , in a confrontation because of one of the biggest real estate imperative Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &quot; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &quot; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors of his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to clarify how their property and their business shall be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna own brothers have collected 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family 1973 bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with its dec@@ eased father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; chief operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
&quot; a law@@ ful venue , that this means that Col@@ in property has been owned by 316 million dollars and Paul worth a value of 176 million dollars . &quot;
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the proposed divisions proposed by Col@@ in proposed age have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first monkey av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed meetings , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in argu@@ ed that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul before , some pos@@ sessions are in@@ competent to manage . &quot;
&quot; in an early monkey av@@ it , that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says , he hope to present the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes , that the family is the most important priority , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs are in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading attor@@ neys , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides by law firm . &quot;
&quot; Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her stor@@ my husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in the Col@@ in the first je@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began to West@@ co , when he was in the last years of high school , when Paul was a small child ( about ten years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed their property to pass on her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of De Lu@@ tis corporation Group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark when leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars were paid . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark , &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; said about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L executive team and after biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; because the case before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to complain and to pull our family name by the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not believe that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he still hope to have a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be past .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new St@@ ef is planning to limit the media @-@ ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reports that the new St@@ ef of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tru@@ mp - including the reports of news media - in the hope to hold the boss on a equ@@ itable course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ por@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new St@@ ef of the White House , he met his first working day with leading staff , he presented a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he wants to repair : bad information that enter into the hands of the president . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings , because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to watch Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media technology . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television ranges back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television application is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if Candi@@ date Tru@@ mp was up@@ set because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards the Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to hold Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter @-@ habit under control , according to six former elect@@ oral campaign , to ensure that his personal media intake involves a ste@@ ad@@ ful praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter @-@ habit ever &quot; under control &quot; was ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps these war@@ ts know something we do not know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets without their intervention would have even more ig@@ nition .
we will probably never know anything about the T@@ we@@ ets which has not sent the Tru@@ mp .
&quot; if his staff had already made it a few times , to maintain away from him , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has to prevent it consistently , that Tru@@ mp controls calls forth . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a white house composed of competing parties , always trying to advance their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp material that may possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - primarily deals with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants , the President of strategic reasons , beyond doubt . &quot;
this was an example that was described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp @-@ Beam@@ s say that Tru@@ mp can react to negative press releases , especially those with damaged le@@ aks and that he disc@@ usses how these come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February , when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who gave the dep@@ uty St@@ ef@@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the Source behind a he@@ ap to be from Lec@@ ks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson were banned from Twitter due to Shi@@ kan@@ en permanently or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he is vo@@ iced in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the dam@@ sel St@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the pap@@ er@@ work and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly attempts three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
master@@ y crimin@@ als get the post of Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the assistance of the population will pray and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police in all over Europe ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to a dangerous crime on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the sear@@ ched sword is natur@@ alized , they are expected and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; calendar of the winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many wings of holiday places to hide , was it called by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
you have compiled 21 Post@@ cards for sear@@ ched crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ asis has been exhibiting for more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online positions could not have been arrested , at least 11 of them due to references to the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; million@@ aire @-@ Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands have been back with some deci@@ ph@@ oned travelers on war @-@ based dit@@ ch to return one field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a af@@ flu@@ ent road of Soli@@ h@@ ull which is called &quot; million@@ aires series . &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of Transpor@@ ter , after they were shot only in May , without being de@@ ported from one by the council to prevent their waste . &quot;
the tak@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressing their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ ders to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants have ur@@ ges the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; they have gone there at the Montag@@ u , after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they cast stones on pas@@ sers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement , because when dealing with the problem was useless . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , they were moved and are now back again . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it , ob@@ serving long sub@@ missions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my community , if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot;
&quot; a resident who wanted not to be called , said , &quot; It is ridicul@@ ous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a pricel@@ ess bearing in the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can continue as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many residents should report a anti @-@ social or criminal conduct in the police by calling them 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we submit our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ters is currently being renovated and will be opened again on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; for the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the dam@@ aging ambi@@ ance company mbH to the 13th of April 2014 , the time of around 30 000 nights were lost per year and also revenue by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in the face of dramatic rising numbers of refugees who arrived in the district court , the hotel building , served as an umbrella accommodation , which was created for contro@@ versy . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the setting of a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not contradic@@ tory at that time .
&quot; but above all the Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bourgeoisie Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prosp@@ ective buyers in the house . &quot;
he should be right .
the Group Lu@@ qu@@ enh@@ otels with head leader Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary au@@ ction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object to four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Man@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof are already standing in front of the entrance to the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear , extensive renovation work . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils have been demol@@ ished , blankets to a part ab@@ ed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the black @-@ style style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with big wal@@ k@@ able showers , the entrance area is converted , there will be new windows installed . &quot;
&quot; everything was later &quot; &quot; beautiful brus@@ g@@ ern@@ ah &quot; &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer express . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms would be set up in wide , explaining it . &quot;
&quot; individual travelers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he already led to so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city be covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants not to define exactly . &quot;
&quot; almost under a million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; the outside plants are also brought into front @-@ up , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , which is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us Special Jury
in the Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires by US President Donald Tru@@ mp should have set special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller for a report called a so called Grand Jury .
&quot; the panel has recorded the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; on appeal to the cause of confidential persons . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper le@@ ak the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has extended his investigations , and intensified . &quot;
&quot; the CN@@ N channels reported , there are already the first pres@@ enters in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; U.S. intelligence services conf@@ lic@@ ted the Krem@@ lin since a longer , targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016 . &quot;
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether they were talking about Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are to be standing in the election campaign as a consultant of the republi@@ cans . &quot;
&quot; according to this report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment among the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ er@@ investig@@ ator Tru@@ mp personally have moved into the centre and I am looking for a pre @-@ d@@ osing , whether the president may hin@@ ders the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine this evidence in possible inter@@ rup@@ tions , and decide whether indic@@ t@@ ment shall be collected . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called charges .
mostly they are switched if they are around larger and contro@@ versy cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the prosec@@ utor &apos;s prosec@@ utor to read persons under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N channels , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were already issued to rot@@ ate to the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ R. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
individuals who were involved in the meetings were called to a statement called it in the report .
&quot; moreover , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tru@@ mp J@@ R. also Tru@@ mp@@ s advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ son Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner and his then his band &apos;s election Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were talking to the conversation .
&quot; legal experts spoke on Thursday evening in the US television , that the objection will show that Mu@@ eller let himself get in@@ timi@@ d and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end on the end to decide on the survey of an indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the replacement of the Gre@@ ase was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of new revelations , the president on Thursday evening uses a speech in West Virginia to present Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the subject give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else that they can talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion , he caught nothing of the formation of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this work also usually in secret , stressed he . &quot;
&quot; the White House , keywords any action , which accelerated the work of the special agent to &quot; fair &quot; way . &quot;
the former F@@ BI manager James Com@@ ey have said three times that he will not be determined against the President .
&quot; there is no reason to accept that something changed , it was in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; however , Mu@@ eller had only been inserted after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; because of this ration@@ ales were alleg@@ ations against Tru@@ mp &apos;s loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp has asked him to adjust the investigations against the then national security advis@@ ors Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure for the study .
&quot; according to the presentation of US @-@ media , the White House material raised against the special authorities and its employees . &quot;
the delet@@ ing spec@@ ulations about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller released .
&quot; unlike an independent special exhibition of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the president Richard Ni@@ xon , has Mu@@ eller has a position in which it could be pushed theoretically by the President of the Minister of Justice . &quot;
there are several sen@@ ators of both parties to avoid such a step .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators had to be released on Thursday , after which the special insur@@ ers could no longer be released so easily . &quot;
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg drives in Antarc@@ tica
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg has solved itself from the barely si@@ zing size Berlin@@ s from the l@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar@@ , and marine research on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; over a tri@@ llion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large Kol@@ oss trei@@ be now to the north and will probably take two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice cream , the researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to men from him .
&quot; to the extent of climate change , climate change has played a role in the break@@ down of the ice age , is unclear according to researchers . &quot;
&quot; however , for around 30 years there have been a series of un@@ common inter@@ rup@@ tions of ice cream in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( N@@ S@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact . &quot;
&quot; according to the opinion of many researchers , it can be connected to the heating @-@ up . &quot;
the Kol@@ om@@ b has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ ine .
Schel@@ del@@ a swi@@ ms down on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it is thus growing further into the sea and breaks up regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ ine is located south of South America nearly at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this Schel@@ del@@ usion was the balance of wax and ab@@ om@@ iting a few years ago .
&quot; a complete Schel@@ del@@ ine was there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there are some things that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ ine is in danger , because the survi@@ vor@@ s have never with@@ drawn as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice @-@ plate also stand below voltage and can fall down , if at a key point a piece of ab@@ bre@@ che . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ del@@ s and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level not , since they float on the water and pus@@ hes as much water as it is after the mel@@ ting yourself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the difference is made that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level , but only in the light extent , the British research project writes to the observation of the Antarc@@ tic ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s is according to AW@@ I @-@ statements with almost 50 000 square kilometres the fourth largest Schel@@ del@@ usion of the Antarc@@ tica .
&quot; at the junction from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the edge of the free ocean approximately 200 meters . &quot;
there it regularly breaks off .
&quot; although there is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is conscious , the ic@@ ality comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ ine will now grow again or be rec@@ alled in the long run , she said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even though these researchers did not withdraw the break@@ down of this gigantic ic@@ eberg , so in the past decades a lot of ice @-@ sh@@ ant@@ y of the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula . &quot;
this long goat of the Antarc@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the polar surface of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has gone back to 28 000 square kilometers since the 19@@ 50s . &quot;
to decline the temperature rose contributed .
&quot; the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula was in the past 50 years , around three degrees warmer and for@@ ged into the areas where the temperature at the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U aims at the staff for the staff
&quot; because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy free spots , the CD@@ U , out of the work@@ station to be more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the roundabout has made 41 new places in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 An@@ des and officials work for the Krei@@ dler in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now once 17 trainees have their first working day .
the teachers in the circle are apparently very talented .
some 620 applicants were to be recorded for the places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle has further personnel in order to cope with the requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is still at the circle M@@ ett@@ mann as far as 50 were not occupied . &quot;
&quot; for example , doctors and engineers are looking for the general administration purposes . &quot;
the CD@@ U want to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and take part in the management of skilled workers in the administration .
the administration is planned to develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development after the request of the parties . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term needs of trade @-@ workers , but forward @-@ looking for the application cr@@ app@@ y measures , is called it . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an educational offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds already after a good approach .
for the circle it has to do with personnel problems that one had not known earlier .
other cities promote good officials and suits and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is by a controlled &apos; competition of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or altern@@ ation due to the service comes out of the ministry . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time for action so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , President of the CD@@ U , with his party still goes beyond the common request . &quot;
&quot; he has long since been on the roundabout for a lazy surprise , when he asked the personnel @-@ free in question and the other parties were intri@@ gu@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; people want to be verified , that all possibilities will be verified , which allow a resign@@ ation from the municipal work association . &quot;
&quot; if we come here not at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the Krei@@ dler with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the nation@@ als cities - to seek a hood of hood , so peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way the CD@@ U , employees and officials tries to pay better than the collective bar@@ gain for public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money there is only when you change to a higher level which is oriented in professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle has grown more and more in recent years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up , in which the rules of the new pro@@ stitute Data Protection Act has to take care of . &quot;
&quot; not least , due to the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel . &quot;
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the tone to NGO @-@ migrants @-@ lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , war@@ ned that they may not continue to continue when they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; &quot; said Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ ese Daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities put a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; conf@@ isc@@ ated because their team had worked together with human hands in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the aid organization , which is only since one year in operation , it turned down to express themselves detailed explanations of the Italian Public Prosec@@ wal@@ ts Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we may collect all alleg@@ ations that are currently collected , only after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities took the boat of &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its crew took infl@@ atable boat on board , which can be delivered directly by human hands , and that sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting , only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast took place , according to the case of the pro@@ secution , whose contents of Italian media has been published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspic@@ i@@ dered , over the authority of the Italian coastal guard , super@@ vis@@ ing the b@@ ail@@ ments in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs . &quot;
under the Code of Con@@ duct you must have boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta above all a Italian police officer who monitored their activities .
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations , have so far agreed to hold on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS of Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be unnecessary but acceptable , as they wouldn &apos;t have any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization doctors without borders ( M@@ SF ) .
&quot; Minn@@ i said , meanwhile , that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the b@@ ail@@ out measures taken in Italy , which lead to the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal guard and carried out cooperation with the local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives , and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that can leave these countries in hope for Europe . &quot;
jet@@ ties and tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin &apos;s out@@ post &quot; &quot; and two guest riders met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of tri@@ bal and sights . &quot;
there were three be@@ friend@@ ed guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour carried out during hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; the viewing points followed , some of which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the covered levels . &quot;
&quot; in between there , there were always longer periods of asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ bal . &quot;
on the second day it was transferred to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the people &apos;s Festival .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga ge@@ ars for E @-@ Sport
&quot; will the sports stars in future are sitting ahead of computer consoles , instead of getting sho@@ cking at wind and weather over the stadium ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ Sport is long since a serious branch , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high passages . &quot;
these have also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly being involved in this field .
&quot; the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , the mid July an e @-@ sport department founded and two professionals for the Computer@@ play FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to ama@@ ze new young audi@@ ences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says executive committee of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is certain that on these train still get several associations .
&quot; at the next weekend , the football World Association organiz@@ es FIFA in London the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t looks great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen are now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football must deal in particular with the 14 to 30 year @-@ old , that the young people continue to go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the associations trying to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian countries . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men , among the contract , you could have a far more maneu@@ ver on these markets than once a year to the Federal Convention to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; in E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or just the soccer simulation FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in the normal sport , also , Li@@ ke established , in which the professionals can compete against each other . &quot;
and at the Asian @-@ 2022 E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the performance is safe to be used . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has long been dealing with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because he &apos;s com@@ peti@@ tive and find many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classic sports - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress@@ ful changes . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it will need cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction capacity . &quot;
professional Gam@@ er should not only be interested in the console but also to train their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the f@@ ted player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; F@@ rob@@ ous looks also problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more an issue . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult for online play , and in the scene failed the structures of classic sports . &quot;
the scientists therefore raise the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; the players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural shirts . &quot;
a study conducted by the Del@@ o@@ itte ( B@@ U ) and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Enter@@ t@@ ein@@ ment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and great tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales will be at 130 million . &quot;
against the barely 2.7 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga was too little .
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant . &quot;
international are many countries already .
major markets are Asia and the USA where Ex basketball ho@@ wer Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sport competition Uni@@ cr@@ n .
also in Europe is doing some things too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport was introduced as class@@ rooms , says F@@ rob@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the Bundes@@ liga associations according to Dut@@ ch@@ ism are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany are lag@@ ging behind &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board of R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old days to be clari@@ fied , no longer is enough today . &quot;
&quot; it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but the company is at the same time al@@ ign the contemporary market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; you cannot hold on it that only when football , everything remains as it was always . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics to push the Con@@ rad Roy for su@@ ic@@ ide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encourages her boyfriend through texts and calls to su@@ ic@@ ide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were exposed to preservation . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned in June for the casual killing of Con@@ rad Roy , which took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is non @-@ eastern .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appeal .
she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psych@@ ic disease .
&quot; dressed in red p@@ ants and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ender , Carter da with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ down eyes , when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; the pro@@ secution said to the court . &quot;
they ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no rep@@ ent@@ ance .
&quot; but Car@@ mine attorney said , it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they are totally de@@ plor@@ able . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day that I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want to be proud of me and as I am with everything I try . I try , despite all my sor@@ eness , which we are carrying for eternity with us , for his sisters , it means to be there . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they will never be part of the realization that they will never take part in the wedding of their brother , or would be a t@@ ante for his children . &quot;
&quot; no more to have this single person I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep in my life for the rest of my life . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ence , as there is no law in Massachusetts , making it a crime to commit to another , su@@ ic@@ ide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead in a vehicle in 2014 by a carbon @-@ oxid@@ ation det@@ ox@@ i@@ fication in a vehicle .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after car@@ ving text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; da@@ g you on , spr@@ ite from a building , educate yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , she said in several messages that she was sent in the two weeks before his death while he was with his family on vacation . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his su@@ ic@@ ide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing what you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy , and ord@@ ained that she would benefit through any press from the case . &quot;
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few , the Carter Defense , belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , condemned the 2007 because of Mor@@ des in her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua was allowed to run for me at the Audi Cup as captain , there is no coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner will take a big season - Extra motivation doesn &apos;t take .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , which looked Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and also not a Manuel Neu@@ er , he made himself a shared bond with his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the objection could have been better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
&quot; but the sign of Coach could also suggest you , too . &quot;
&quot; not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was in the youth playful , Deb@@ ate and just chosen from the holiday professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a gam@@ er chosen , but he . &quot;
sugar distri@@ butes well at the de@@ ar@@ est thing to those who want to hold a lot in mood .
&quot; who thus chosen , the heritage of Lah@@ m was born , can only use a small extra @-@ motivation . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : to assume responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
&quot; on the right back , this is now its position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did their rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ me in this start @-@ formation , as the one who can take the rod even at the best . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to channel the un@@ recorded tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the look for the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; Vid@@ al thus , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ te barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus to get to devil come out to the services of Asia travel ( fol@@ te also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le therefore , not negative in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
this all folded very well .
&quot; aside from Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y went beside Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y before the wehr , both ag@@ ated sou@@ ver@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ called Nap@@ oli @-@ storm is often difficult , in addition , addi@@ c@@ ely tried in the game building a few times . &quot;
his colleague Rud@@ y gave us that the result was not so as we expected this .
but even he showed a decent performance at the point .
&quot; shift , tempor@@ al change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bayern @-@ Welt is still looking for new@@ sletters , in connection with the game . &quot;
&quot; Rud@@ y for example was not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me passed on a few kn@@ itted statements on the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; there he heard of South Africa an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; which goes here , I have already been ham@@ mo@@ ated . &quot;
at Bavaria you just have to gain any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , it does not have to teach the new . &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz minister : economy lo@@ ath Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it has often been irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able to establish the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , the Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
&quot; it shows itself after more than one year , in which the new economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V demand from a change in economic policy - and impeccable at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ er companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the desires of the economy to the Lem@@ ke office . &quot;
the largest K@@ ehr@@ enbach sees Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now on top of the country &apos;s primary list .
&quot; once this year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning process , until 2021 the building is supposed to stand . &quot;
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Tri@@ er that stands in the urgent need for the federal road .
&quot; the goal is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says the Minister Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees in it a sign for regional , but internationally competing enterprises . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er asp@@ ires , as by Wis@@ sing , the wine is a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate label to raise the sales in supermarkets and halt the trend of the German win@@ eg@@ exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to create a own company , praise the Chamber of Chamber . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Tri@@ er sees in the new Master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; planned is a premium of 1000 euros for the best Championships and 2500 euros , if gradu@@ ates within ten years after the master@@ training . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; at the planned road construction , be quick facts to create , at the same time fl@@ aw the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Head of the Chamber of Chamber of Chamber of Commerce Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; from 56 new engineers to set the Wis@@ sing in the local market , so far only 29 places are occupied . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ ac@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to calculations of the invoice , the country investment in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less proposed in the preservation of country roads . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the skilled workers in the region .
harv@@ esting is also the previous broad@@ band @-@ building in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had only evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the Note 3,4 . &quot;

Audi is intended to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter@@ reaction
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would be offering to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chair said : the company was the opinion that &quot; &quot; there are intelligent options as a limited restrictions , &quot; and then moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to offer or limit . &quot;
Daim@@ ler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce his diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automobile manufacturers , plants to install neutr@@ alization of the prop@@ elled out of diesel vehicles , take also too , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be charged to ignore the powerful drive companies and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen to avoid the use of so @-@ above devices , the emissions control , if a car has been tested , but when a car has been tested . &quot;
&quot; in the United States several were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and therefore is not protected from delivery , and could be put in court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities launched Audi to have a system installed in order to deal with emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been extended . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be a Volkswagen heavy loads : the luxury car manufacturer carries more proportionate to winning Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ases and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the most published Car@@ to@@ on @-@ Dra@@ ner , the Kn@@ oll@@ ards of his figures are its trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian still works and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he proposed among other things as a sign for happiness cards - what was frustr@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded at the end of the 60s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in the &quot; Paris match &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
and again we inspire the artists of cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo figures c@@ avor@@ ting in drawings with the sh@@ ale tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he is still sitting according to the sign that today is almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; via calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush animals and watches are still finding a lot of spread worldwide . &quot;
for six years he also works at a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures .
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gir@@ affe - Mor@@ dil@@ los At@@ test@@ es animal in his drawings - that has a thousand feet as a counter . &quot;
&quot; first time his figures in the 3D @-@ film , who is to come to the cinema wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;

&quot; therefore he puts more on the TV series , which , as its original records , which is not power@@ less produced . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; lav@@ ender is stimul@@ ated because of dro@@ ught to dro@@ ught conditions and because of the diseases of transfer@@ able insects , the scientists and farmers who try to find solutions that great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian Institute , CRI@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effective at risk because the plant in recent years has exposed the effects of climate change , which in the spring has brought much less rain , and in the autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the life span of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small goat , a micro bacter@@ ium , the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil lo@@ wers not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers - it is also very qu@@ eri@@ ed for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having very long crop watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ ENT@@ W@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered to be considered , include better water distribution and slo@@ wing of the dark from the ground , but also the beast of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist empha@@ sizes the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the Weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet up to check their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a , by organised crime , corrupt officials and c@@ eas@@ eless drugs . &quot;
&quot; but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
&quot; it has been told to them , that it is important to change its routines . &quot;
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feel safer : they should take their children with the office , who were the target of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : ad@@ vers@@ al , Neutr@@ al , Verb@@ und . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ por@@ ters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , perc@@ eptions , and belly . &quot;
&quot; there are drug regul@@ ators , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists who are di@@ gest@@ ed to stand on the secret list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no relaxing break from violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses , are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 began his office . 5@@ 89 are facing at least seven deaths in seven States this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her editor and her inspir@@ er is by Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence will be felt deep , although his presence everywhere exists - a large picture of Val@@ dez , which shows his mid@@ finger with the word &quot; &quot; Justice &quot; , &quot; hang on the fa@@ ç@@ ade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce @-@ building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the three @-@ time , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , which have his ridicul@@ ous face with glasses or its typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss about its shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 a Son@@ der @-@ Federal Office was established in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , which are linked every year with drug trading and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists will rarely be put to justice . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are un@@ ob@@ tr@@ un@@ eastern and even though the terrain is now sl@@ anted . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting has little value for discussing the security , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very du@@ mm to w@@ asting my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we mi@@ stru@@ ate all . &quot;
in the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the City of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; he managed just to go a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla has been hal@@ ted by two men . he was forced out of his car , presum@@ ably due to the name of the newspaper - the &quot; &quot; twelve @-@ known river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cap was away by car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
ru@@ m@@ ors tend to be free from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an @-@ free .
but to the subject of Val@@ dez it is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ ens of the country , since ri@@ val@@ ing groups fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not make that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people can be shot across the street , or that the cemetery is full of mixed , two @-@ story mouse @-@ c@@ een drugs , which are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; tranquility &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings contributed to the murder .
&quot; first in February the release of a interviews with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ating cart@@ on in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gear members bought each specimen of the issue as soon as they were delivered to tim@@ ber@@ ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second error was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which had released the same story to leave the country into its own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he has survived so long that his friends and colleagues were ann@@ ex@@ ed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ por@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce with five colleagues and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without having to come to the pre@@ d@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; in time , the newspaper earned a reputation because of cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took place . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ters loved to publish tough studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else could handle . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the formation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot &quot; &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , where ever she has led . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily to that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to live on , &quot; he said to the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; Dru@@ gs in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you must assume the task which falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of so many dead ... why did you not told what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missing Val@@ dez , the spa@@ wn @-@ bird , which was like a port worker , the friend , who knew generous with h@@ ugs and advice attacks , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted with his routine .
he would always carry out his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go and sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; well , ask them : was his love for routine his inheritance ? &quot;
&quot; his death also has forced them to ask her own assu@@ mptions in question , how they can best do their work and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
to trust his own inst@@ in@@ ers .
&quot; if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell is a sense that can be mist@@ aken ... and then the thing with J@@ avier happens . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as not as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas , VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt governance . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , suddenly there were no phones allowed . days previously was known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively by governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were protecting the heat from 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
&quot; they were commissioned by the State Government , the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; half in the Scher@@ z , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers , who signed the governor itself as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ por@@ ters had gone into the mountain landscape , where the drugs are de facto under control . &quot;
for the edition of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has broken down on three main stories .
there was ass@@ ass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had a Ex@@ pos@@ é to the state , concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; and there was one group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ por@@ ter from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy player , the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) heard that almost all the political planes ruled by the whole century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of highly @-@ employed cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ por@@ ter to write about pre@@ dominant inci@@ dents in this eat@@ ery , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went a military attack . &quot;
only a few months ago the readers had seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , dedicated to the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employee had become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
the Repor@@ ting Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez sho@@ ok a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared and three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is his . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become more lou@@ der by being written in organized Prot@@ ests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on the wal@@ k@@ way and construction . &quot;
&quot; on this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez weg in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a in the day after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez sei@@ zed the authorities , journalists and let them move , because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since been asked that she is once again divided from the government , because she is concerned that her anger has in@@ ju@@ red their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , are involved in government officials and an equal society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; he wrote that the re@@ por@@ ter are not only killed by drugs , but also on the command of politicians and security organs , with organised crime against a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the media &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; launched more than half of the attacks against journalists of the police and officials in the past year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico stir@@ red you , because they want you dis@@ proportion the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border @-@ state Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas six years ago .
&quot; your body was found together with a note that supposedly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; I am here because of my reports . &quot;
a computer prob@@ es and headphones were located next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
&quot; others continue , as it did El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo to the ass@@ ass@@ ination of their director in 2004 . &quot;
2010 was the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez openly to the drug card details on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile and watch them still the streets and look for dangers .
&quot; and sometimes they are h@@ unted how it was apparently mur@@ dered by the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , the 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ City three months after the flight from VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; for those who want to stay back and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ corro@@ sive decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives to that the drug trading brought him fright@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became re@@ por@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on the side@@ walk from the office and drank beer , when all their teleph@@ ones began to sum up once all their teleph@@ ones began . &quot;
a series of shooting with Band@@ en@@ ri@@ v@@ alen and security shops close to the bath@@ or@@ tes Maz@@ at@@ lan had confirmed 19 lo@@ aves .
the war continues to escal@@ ate how it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the on @-@ board complex they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ els close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez thre@@ w a look at the police officers who stopped guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid of all , they showed it not . &quot;
&quot; under the vast portrait of the fallen Grün@@ ders of the newspaper , the mid@@ finger was visible for quite s@@ alo@@ a , followed by the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce its marks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when on the same day , the internship was mur@@ dered , she asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used to turn his enemies .
at first sight it looks like a statue if a fright@@ ening .
&quot; now , researchers have found that the first insights of the unbelievable Rhin@@ oplast@@ y of a Canadian Berg@@ worker has been received so well that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received , that they could even notice that his singing skin was of red@@ ly Braun - and they said , they had something from an &quot; &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology , &quot; signed it as &quot; the bes@@ ter@@ ated din@@ osau@@ rs that ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period before between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; its unbeliev@@ ably well preserved state has researchers who describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ fres@@ ser is the best preserved F@@ ossi@@ l of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was born on 21 March 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine in the vicinity of Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something , which seemed to be done from the surrounding rocks at the place , and decided to look more accurately . &quot;
the fossil fuel discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animals within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy mineral pump . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just had a bit with the eyes blin@@ z@@ eln , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist im Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the science of knowledge as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that this crop @-@ e@@ aters , although he is covered with an arm@@ or and a changing tank , probably threatened by flesh and send din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly frequ@@ ented din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide themselves from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shi@@ el@@ ding technology that is also used as a counter @-@ coating , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to do@@ ve its enemies , saying experts , which indicates that it was threatened by greater din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old Kre@@ atur from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs has made head@@ lines in May for the first time and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ edly named Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully . &quot;
the astonishing conservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists who document patterns and the form of sc@@ ales and ar@@ mo@@ urs through his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ady , a common defensive method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature dar@@ ker was as its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ady usually is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it pointed out that the din@@ osau@@ rs has been h@@ unted by enough pressure through meat @-@ v@@ ore din@@ osau@@ rs , the evolution that fav@@ oring the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals , which put the counter sh@@ ady - do you think of deer , z@@ eb@@ ras or G@@ ür@@ k - are much smaller and vulnerable as pre@@ y , which was sign@@ alized that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ y @-@ behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the cra@@ yon time , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sc@@ ales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red @-@ brown .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on references to his life , including its con@@ serving Dar@@ min@@ ate to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs died , when he died , into a river and turned out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta was as warm as the south fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with preser@@ v@@ ated skin skin , but also in three dimensions , and the original form of the beast , said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early circle .
&quot; you do not need much fantasy to re@@ construct it to re@@ construct it . if you just have a bit with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
&quot; the cra@@ yon time was a time , when giant ther@@ opo@@ da , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ ess barrier that arose on two legs the earth had gone through . &quot;
&quot; though the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ unted by some of his terrible ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists who appear to their latest findings in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta in@@ ju@@ red after death in the sea and in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was born on 21 March 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine in the vicinity of Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the owned din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to the hips . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long peaks , that rag@@ ed by his shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ant crop @-@ fres@@ ser was blo@@ wn by the Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater perception of the din@@ osau@@ rs kept his arm@@ our in an exquisite detail .
&quot; the rem@@ n@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well preserved , that the hood become still hol@@ pri@@ ge tank @-@ plates along the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geo@@ graphic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I get it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied res@@ te of the skin still cover the hol@@ pri@@ mor@@ ed tank @-@ plates , which carry the sk@@ ull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right @-@ down front is at his side , his five fingers are dis@@ rupted upwards . &quot;
I can count the sc@@ ales to his sole .
in the storm : Mass@@ enk@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many Ver@@ last
&quot; fier@@ ce accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass am@@ ass@@ ass@@ age . &quot;
&quot; there are numerous wo@@ unded , kilomet@@ re long St@@ aus and G@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
&quot; on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , late Thursday morning , some 20 people have been in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; after the first indications of the police at 17.00 hours between the connection between Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis , A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ storm of almost 30 cars , including those who are likely to smoke . &quot;
about the exact number of closures at first there were no information .
&quot; it is a light to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a great advent of b@@ ail@@ plane was at the in@@ genu@@ ity .
the A@@ 8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
in chassis of Munich there was some ten kilometers long to return .
&quot; as a AZ re@@ por@@ ter reports , it also came to massive disability through numerous G@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
&quot; fire bri@@ g@@ ade not@@ ated the marks of the vehicles , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive str@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 pm , the second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between a car racing and a truck .
a rescue helic@@ opter was on the way to in@@ genu@@ ity .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody experienced once : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and awak@@ ened a brutal or irrit@@ ates the m@@ ast in the middle of the work@@ flow .
check@@ box control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the German Rail currently tests the self @-@ free ticket control .
one simply confirms the mobile phone that you have taken its place and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; if the offer comes up , we extend it out . &quot;
&quot; it will be available to many further correspondence in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; said a subway . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is the rail &quot; stand@@ ings without Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; to use this , however , you need to meet some conditions : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; you should also have purchased it via the app , the DB Navigator , which is the convenient way of a ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : one climb@@ s to the train , calls his ticket to &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
with the test customers then a button appears on the electronic de@@ valuation .
the pull @-@ guides get a message on their mobile devices that the g@@ ast X has on the train and the booked seat Y .
comes the draw companion in the box control to position Y knows that there is a passenger with already dischar@@ ged online ticket .
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; those who want to relax without a ticket control by our aim to travel , it @-@ tastes in the DB Navigator simply itself . &quot;
&quot; this will allow the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael K@@ son , Marketing @-@ Management Board of DB . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives , know that besides delays and pas@@ sions the box controls are to be the biggest res@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; for many times you have , in any case , but one of the fellow travellers not all documents that you need to de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the personal ID is missing , or otherwise a document that you must pre @-@ wise . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between the companion and bicycles , which leads to bad mood in the exhaust or large space and delays in the control of your own tickets and at the end time takes the time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other draw numbers on the same track are not yet activated .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core .
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , sat in St. Louis Par@@ inn@@ ate on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it still lies on the road , called it there . &quot;
&quot; confused as no one else was posted on their fe@@ ed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed on their Tim@@ eline .
&quot; the Rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live . &quot;
he posted a picture of bro@@ wning body that was stretched on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell at himself . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their fel@@ lowship .
she placed her cell phone in order to return later in the evening to twe@@ et about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people , the cri@@ ed , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live @-@ feel that a polic@@ eman was in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a rebel@@ li@@ ant dog .
&quot; in another video , she said that another polic@@ eman his ri@@ f@@ le and crying : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , remember her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to and which we can name typical .
at that moment I felt sh@@ akes .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a return trip and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing around 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father , and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ant , love and loss of resistance , strength and resistance , which is from the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to request answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , which was a fl@@ oral dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two got a conversation that she had countless times in front of this morning , about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you , when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she reminded me of what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what is happening today is a climax of what happened in the past .
it has to know and to be seen and raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience an ec@@ at@@ ant racism , it is not different from the next black women . &quot;
&quot; I feel it , I would prove her a bad service to keep them far away . &quot;
&quot; the first stop when she arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp site , when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local partner . &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began to accept a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has been totally changed after 9 August , she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis president of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urses Association and focused on eating justice and health benefits in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in the organization .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell arrived during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the Co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question was Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism has been nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often of wh@@ ites in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and res@@ ili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an explained recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices were not centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , which is known for its activ@@ ism by death @-@ tract in@@ mates . &quot;
his involvement brought the project closer together with six other natives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after the shooting of shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; it was the main thing for me how these people are presented , for so I will be shown . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells experience - to show that it is in the movement &quot; not to a m@@ essi@@ as leaders , but about a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ er &apos;s life as she loves himself and her wife mar@@ ries .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work , and in the understanding of black people . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells history is the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of movement , which were marked after the killing of black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as sul@@ try . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , pregnant women need to carry the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an atmospheric to remark , that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not a affirm@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who burned this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the forefront , because when living on these crosses as a black , pregnant woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long gone , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to pers@@ ist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on gran@@ ting for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ age of a highway in a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless they cl@@ ashed against a singing , and she feels committed to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the street three years ago . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; from &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery &quot;
&quot; the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern divi@@ dend of the pedestrian prec@@ inct since the first presentation of 2009 the population in supporters and opponents .
&quot; cold , the subject can hardly be one . &quot;
on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic is discussed .
&quot; as the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Becker ) or &quot; &quot; that would be real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a human &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ aking ) or quite simple : &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build on it that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which also the other businesses benefit , fear the opponents of the pedestrian prec@@ ede . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery will be built exactly on the property , on which the market hall is being market , in the 13 direct market @-@ market products . &quot;
the construction work will be concluded with the start of the construction .
&quot; the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall into new building - in addition to the Bed@@ a @-@ place with opportunity , to the outside seats . &quot;
Simone rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost every week in the hall market for many years .
&quot; mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land rejo@@ icing always very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
&quot; we would like to make sure that during and especially after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also .
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt , is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; whether direct market @-@ market in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
but this is likely not likely to be low at the new project .
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what advantages in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ m@@ wear or supermarkets : I find it super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
you see how many shop@@ stores here are empty - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that we will at least get the mark@@ eth@@ all . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is also very inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , stores are requested in a shopping center only by bigger companies because the dor@@ f@@ uses are often not portable for a ret@@ ailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special , there are almost no more and what is left of it , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a market hall fits for me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farm@@ hall building during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even when the bit Gallery is actually coming .
or is it possible to sell all the shops of Bit@@ burg in advance ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is simply not working .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , there is no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a far@@ mark@@ er hall it thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ sin@@ ess many - as I find - sensu@@ ous construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no place anymore .
&quot; if the peasant market hall is made , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ different - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tup@@ far and Haar@@ lem who have been sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison fort Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analytics analy@@ st had made a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence , after they made a secret diplomatic reports on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition that was opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ embl@@ ance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed into its professional competence in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and pioneering disco@@ urses , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithms of DNA , which was extrac@@ ted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , a sharp , if something intellectual comment could not only be interpreted in the form of DNA data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ated determin@@ ants of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already been spoken for their pu@@ ber@@ ty above the identification as a woman , was sentenced in 2013 because of 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations against the es@@ pion@@ age network , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; by the prison her picture was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only a single photo - a gran@@ ny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in the Mann@@ ing inten@@ tionally is sitting on a driver seat and has a plat@@ inum Persian has been associated with which it was also associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the great success of her 2012 @-@ project &quot; stran@@ ger Vis@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist portraits produced by stran@@ gers from for@@ ensi@@ c art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigarette m@@ ute and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by producing a picture of how these people might look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a time @-@ mail .
&quot; they carried an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany any kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press show of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so she took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA @-@ portrait . &quot;
the artist and their incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use have become un@@ equal pen@@ pal that has been exchanged for several letters in the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ fied Com@@ ic &quot; Stock@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; which would be fores@@ een a future in which the president would shake the verdi@@ ct and she would be able to personally see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release returned to seven brutal years in a military coup in K@@ ansas , was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is even now at the opening of the exhibition a bit deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against inform@@ ants from the government of government and against trans@@ gender @-@ troops to find new , twe@@ eter ways to fix the rigi@@ d divisions that he should actually remedy . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange timing of all of these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; on a wall of the gallery of written artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with its super@@ big signature including ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their family name is equipped with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frac@@ turing , the basis of sex , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written by C@@ s and GS and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cl@@ e@@ ot@@ ids according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological sense , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring with it is that our gen@@ ome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories can also be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room is one page from the above Com@@ ic Nov@@ els mentioned above . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing how they emerg@@ es with a free phone in hand from the rec@@ kl@@ ace of the United States as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they put your speech , then they have won , &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted in Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ aring , when I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it should be looked forward in the com@@ ic book - but when they should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , which unite like hor@@ des of the prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted , as everything is written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , which were written with a pencil on their genetic h@@ ap@@ lo@@ groups . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd @-@ set , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels with Chelsea , like the movement , which also hidden behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a cler@@ k of the University of Oxford because of killing
&quot; a nation@@ wide human hunt is under way for a professor at North@@ western University and one employee of the University of Oxford , who were looking for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
on Monday we were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ t because of its inn@@ ed involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acts of the court of Cook County .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several styles died . &quot;
one of the police authority of Chicago published non@@ public war@@ nings that the cor@@ pse was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the place of action for dead , and det@@ ective investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seeks after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them has been an extraordinary Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , vice @-@ president for university relationships , said in an e @-@ mail statement , that La@@ them had now been indic@@ ative and ruled out by the Campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is investigated by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co @-@ operates in this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a speaker at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement , that &quot; we are in touch with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want , that he set himself . &quot;
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said , he urge the susp@@ ects to address the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip given that in apartment 10@@ 08 had happened .
police described the scene as a very cruel one .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security sk@@ am@@ eras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim , including a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible home event . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada Road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ recipes Mut@@ ko
the Russian vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with Ukrain ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada road plan was updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; declared Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for the re@@ conditioning of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause Russia to concern . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list stipul@@ ates , however , that Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities must publicly accept the findings of the W@@ ada lawyer by Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren , to publicly accepted D@@ op@@ ings in Russian Sports . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter of Mut@@ ko : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ D@@ oping system has placed an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales point R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has before , to accept this report uncondi@@ tionally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ USA@@ DA was ruled out in November 2015 in the wake of the dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ als from W@@ ada by implementing D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the principal leader of the organization in Moscow in July W@@ ada @-@ General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ USA@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di has not sold any Eg@@ gs anymore
these shared the corporate groups .
&quot; it may be a pure precau@@ tionary measure , it could not be assumed by any health impair@@ ment , it was in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs are being delivered to Al@@ di , which have been tested negative on fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il@@ hal@@ ic anti @-@ l@@ ex@@ hr@@ ine . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to establish clarity and transparency for its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next u@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys are not working .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - worse - fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke anonym@@ ity , some workers did not judge the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she has called people from outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the w@@ ax@@ ing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software to address the specific purpose of the measurement of employees , it allows companies to address surveys , speci@@ ality groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ n allow the C @-@ Suite executives to turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they have now tools such as Str@@ ava and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment . &quot;
&quot; save , she said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys by certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low additives , so that you can pick up . &quot;
&quot; in addition , companies arrive at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ ale , since then a former employee told a blog post that have been talking about the environment that have spoken , pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business approach .
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and realize , saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
El@@ ber has recently been registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent companies can send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , confidential responses in real time and view the warmth of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employee can report a real behavior .
&quot; and if the main business is involved , complaints go directly to the Super@@ visory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion recorded regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that its employees are poorly treated or beh@@ ol@@ ically , it can be precious consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and charges , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Conver@@ cent has been deployed for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was seriously taken . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said , there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints from our employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company Conver@@ cent supports , can problem , the previously identified by managers who have been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ lau@@ der internship , quickly identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who manages the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , ethics , values and employees in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the ethics , men used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ cent provide your software as a service , and strain the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors which have supported the start @-@ ups .
&quot; Conver@@ cent has received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sap@@ ph@@ ire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which has been raised to the capital of $ 47 million . &quot;
Gl@@ itz@@ ers attended $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought up his entire financing to $ 60 million .
&quot; this investment will hardly come surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s staff members expect more than before . &quot;
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only assignments .
staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you can give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be in a company that their voices are doing , and that the work you are doing , then they feel more strongly obliged to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In which both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve return when their portfolio companies are running well . companies are running well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools offered by third parties , dedication and commitment to the employees , it is no wonder that you can find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement after the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company cannot take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the shift does not come quickly enough , or not at all , these dis@@ appointments can be frustr@@ ated and asked . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , the company who have left themselves very much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow employees , &quot; &quot; did you really hear me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
and who do not worry about why should I ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed which has now performed monthly staff surveys , was able to initi@@ ate action on the same day when a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ruby Tuesday , the company always gets new insights on the employees and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a branch that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it is at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA @-@ Foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercise of the team on the campus .
some have moved their Tri@@ kot@@ bal parts and show the back of swe@@ at from the first day of the training manager .
for a good part of the team these unt@@ old minutes are a lunch break .
&quot; players who are written down to the summer courses , are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30@@ pm to the water@@ man football center . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
therefore the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already packed time sched@@ ules of the player .
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than one day , at which the brood is postpon@@ ed nearly a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six game times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
you should keep in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of the formal player preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; MOR@@ A said that he support the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add a further point of the players to the players . &quot;
&quot; we put these tremendous strain three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they have just down , they plac@@ id up , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices , as soon as the camp is finished , what is faced with the clear views of its fields from an adjacent parking and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which is already covered with a door@@ way , which is a protective network behind a door@@ way , which is not an easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spatial that there might be an issue as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real issue , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there and then set an exercise there . &quot;
if you have the video from an exercise it is a pretty good deal .
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too much worried about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook aims to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ feit news
&quot; Facebook will send more potential articles with fal@@ seh@@ oods of third parties and show their results under the original record , then , said the world &apos;s largest online @-@ social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website , that it is to begin with the use of updated machine methods , to detect possible mis@@ ses and to send them to fac@@ ten@@ ders , which may display results from the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main points of points for so @-@ called f@@ ake news , many of whom believe that they also have influenced the U.S. presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a big political issue in Europe , whereas the French voters were floo@@ ded in advance of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany shall support a plan , according to social media networks , if it does not succeed , h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation of German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be launched a test of the new facts . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the realization that stories of fact @-@ drawn parties are challenged , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product Archive for Facebook @-@ News in a Blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; in connection item &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his messages @-@ feed to reduce false messages . &quot;
creation of a Com@@ ic system : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a sk@@ ul@@ cher for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has spent 700 years turbul@@ ent history of his cozy seat at the Ma@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent , and now is now for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manus@@ cript from someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; he says sore . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England , sp@@ ans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families that illustrated in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ bs on the side of a letter that has been written by a double @-@ day in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
&quot; and letters always cra@@ wl up to smoke , because at that time there is a fire because of light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , smell has an effect as if he himself would be . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have my welcome gru@@ dge a little exagger@@ ated &quot; ) it seems to be all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to examine the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ oph@@ istic@@ ated hybrid heads in the walls and the bottles , the centuries spent in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he hi@@ ked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with Land@@ scape , gardening , and sometimes with the artists who worked in the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only received the full access in 2006 as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; as Rhodes , a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive that he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; letters , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what poss@@ essed : &quot; you might think that land fl@@ ees would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ar to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go about it ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to un@@ wa@@ its base in the English history , including &apos;@@ The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos;s , which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il , of 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; K@@ night@@ ly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
the farmers started in this area and I thought a u@@ prising was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected with each other ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who told the history of the Jes@@ u@@ it , who hid the family Dar@@ rell for seven years . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell is shown in the 18th century , who filled its own bur@@ ial mo@@ an ( a discovery which was only years later , when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite busy gig , and again debt and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men prov@@ oked their debt crises , expres@@ sing rich old women - I imagine it as a he@@ ap well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise Er@@ bin@@ nen . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his efforts at the castle , Rhodes is in search of other unique scre@@ ams experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ ki behind him , the terrain of a san@@ at@@ orio dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been returned from nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ en@@ dorf
&quot; with the extension of the 301 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ en@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; to Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan at home . &quot;
at the end of August there should be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? &quot; ask the creators of action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ en@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; write them out of their yesterday release . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
&quot; and to make it clear , that some is better than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in the action you go to more than &quot; &quot; only &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is on the way . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all @-@ called promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able all @-@ time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a mid @-@ five dig@@ it amount will be the city of Bad Honnef its new umbrella and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
each year in the beginning of August advis@@ es on Ankara the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on oscill@@ ations and carriage in the officer cor@@ ps .
this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; the discussions took part in the presidency of the state now also the five Vice @-@ recipes , as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , justice and foreign affairs . &quot;
&quot; there@@ with , the civilians were in Y@@ as in the number . &quot;
the government moves the bree@@ ders in the military .
&quot; the General Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , aviation and nav@@ y were set off . &quot;
&quot; since the failed Cou@@ p , President Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 Gener@@ als and admir@@ als were fired . &quot;
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to the inn@@ um@@ erable connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wire @-@ moving of the coup .
&quot; against 486 people , which should immediately be involved in the coup , will be involved in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup Erdo@@ gan had described the overthrow of Erdo@@ gan as a &quot; divine gift , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to clean@@ se the Arm@@ ed Forces &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan the army really under control ?
&quot; by the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ riyet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; discomfort in the military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the general law there may be concerns for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which is manifest@@ ed among other things in the lifting of the head@@ tu@@ ch@@ ban for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the big re@@ w@@ ness in the army and the security sk@@ irts are at any rate further .
&quot; in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan by decre@@ e more 73@@ 95 cou@@ tries , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 54@@ 6 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it appeared , as did Erdo@@ gan run the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als are formerly the real masters of the country .
three times they heard them under appeal to their role as guar@@ dian of the world order .
&quot; after his election victory , Erdo@@ gan &apos;s power arose step by step , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan stri@@ ps targeted by the armed forces of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; V@@ oc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; named a particular officer officer , who sought after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
&quot; to do this , such development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is no doubt in the alliance according to the inf@@ ants of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules of the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he looks forward to lower the legal immigrants on 50,000 a year , str@@ ingent regulations for reducing visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is supposed to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and increase billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way the US will change the way the citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the funds to assist themselves and show knowledge that our economy will come to good , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to get circuit for racing
&quot; over the past few months , over the past few months over the future of the race sl@@ utt@@ les , it was now going to go quickly . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , at the mar@@ sh route , on which the tourist car drives , will be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing series in the long term , according to the provisions of the Ministry of Transport , this year will begin to start working on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to continue to order and re@@ construct the track Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country leads to this especially important for tourism , &quot; stated traffic mandate Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of restoring the track he rose to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , I am currently being coordinated , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Railway as an operator was already agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; this is the timetable which tr@@ aded vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus it was to be ordered the race @-@ Sty@@ g Shuttle in December 2017 .
the racing cycle @-@ shuttle is one of the most popular railway connection between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; over the past few months , a pilot project was tested in the course of a pilot project , whether the circuit is used by sufficient many people to order them again in the future . &quot;
the track is also strong in parts strong .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should take care of
&quot; just as you thought , that it would not be even more crazy , a new report comes about technological developments in the area of sex robots . &quot;
yes indeed .
sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ zed professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny about it , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said at the release of his new report . &quot;
&quot; modern Sex@@ es have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a sili@@ cone , which feels warm , with deliberately human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can adapt its robots even according to its beliefs , and select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot about the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but there is still more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities , &quot; that would be a Step@@ ford woman progressive . &quot;
modern Sex@@ es have developed to robots with a sili@@ cone .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics which they are appealing , such as students . &quot;
&quot; and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programmed figures such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conv@@ eys the impression of students and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; she likes what you like , and she may not like what you do not like , etc . &quot;
she also has her m@@ oods in the course of the day - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ ed female characteristics , the bac@@ kl@@ ash on rape if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( said here : conf@@ lic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah goes , be@@ un@@ quiet a most . &quot;
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibration but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibration , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; it is on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex @-@ robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing refinement indicate something dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal equality of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course have no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted its increasing popularity , they still remain temporary at the edge of the consumption culture . &quot;
&quot; but what happened from the boundary , can be in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not wei@@ rd or offensive , until they are the free market to do so . &quot;
&quot; there is however a certain rem@@ c@@ ision , that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a while in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which the White House gives a president who has he@@ ed to have women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most aw@@ ful aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the sle@@ eves body and the stolen eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these Sex robots is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with porno@@ graphic proportions ) .
&quot; their builder wants to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are no real women . &quot;
you can not separate or walk from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no placement or a background history , nothing that could distur@@ b on independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
other words : they are f@@ aint slaves .
or to express it in the phrases of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the in@@ comprehen@@ sion of a healthy man
&quot; it has become a bin@@ der of the Tru@@ mp era , that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the U.S. elect@@ or@@ ships even families in small @-@ format . &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest there was in the US newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp Com@@ ing relatives .
we all str@@ aps ourselves to let our filter slot .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s to bring families together .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousine , a left @-@ directed poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been visiting with the republi@@ cans in our family , who has visited this week in New York . &quot;
they reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , had fought by the Republi@@ can , suddenly and quite nicely on the same side . &quot;
&quot; in order to the dining table , this certainly is a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this will also have significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the resulting effect of his presidency has the force to shift us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ acious opportunity to let us no longer be ab@@ duc@@ ted by one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a sh@@ red@@ ly long @-@ time scenario , in the Tru@@ mp Republi@@ cans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; which suddenly appear once compared to its standards suddenly as in@@ comprehen@@ sion of denial . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s com@@ ic version of the hiding place - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ah , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - which may indeed occur as a very mild crime . &quot;
if Tru@@ mp is going to be the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement .
&quot; when my C@@ ousine was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the New York &apos;s park department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you do not need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are huge , the fiber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all cl@@ owns are cris@@ y and the animals are revol@@ ve to look out full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate change gives this in a notable way . &quot;
&quot; so many stere@@ otypes of a city is disappointing : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines will become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; five years later , and I still didn &apos;t get across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the topic pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a great roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the central park @-@ carousel however is still a strange experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have rate the carousel , I would have given him full score , but fortunately nobody asked him after that . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before using my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to finish the rating with a 15 % drinking money - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slo@@ w@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved with breast aches from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for the second time .
&quot; last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of bar@@ racks , which he suffered the pris@@ ons according to a fall in his cell . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us has been sentenced to the Public Prosec@@ ut@@ ors for murder , due to an appeal of the prosec@@ utor of the Prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by having them several times through a door of the toil@@ ett@@ enk@@ ab@@ ine in his house in Pret@@ oria on her .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us said that he kept his girlfriend for a night @-@ night in@@ tru@@ der , who hidden himself in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year @-@ old sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , by which they say she is too sight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Court of Justice said that they will raise the objection to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence increased to 15 years , when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold is a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Flower schools , the quarters of the flower schools were released from F@@ oters and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen to the holidays and the leading schools . &quot;
three of the charges are in the future to the gram@@ mar school , four to the real school . &quot;
&quot; Schul@@ er Angel@@ ica Sit@@ te , welcomed the parents and representative of the public in the civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen . &quot;
&quot; as a symbol of the school leaving the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schum@@ acher and Reg@@ ine Meder a young eag@@ le , who grows in the chicken , but it is released into the freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ unter@@ e Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the Ch@@ ech@@ erhof . &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold was a strange egg , and sent it out of his h@@ ens . &quot;
instead of a chicken breasts a small eag@@ le came out .
&quot; but the hope to make out of him a chicken , sm@@ ashed , the eag@@ le spreads up his wings on a high mountain and escap@@ ed her wings . &quot;
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken .
&quot; they danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylin@@ ders to take the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stand for integration , said Schul@@ er Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; young is indeed different from the other young animals ( chic@@ ks ) , but they belong to this . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wished in every quarter that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; this followed thanks to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who is always jumping into teaching and the parent &apos;s representatives . &quot;
the chic@@ ks was now over , the teacher trained Sophia Schum@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; she lay down her students after two years of lessons , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was able to rely on the neighborhoods scattered . &quot;
&quot; finally , all the students entered a song from summer time and holiday season . &quot;
this was great pleasure in the children .
for the new school year eight first @-@ press units have already registered .

Daim@@ ler has communicated to anyone affected .
&quot; if any inspection is required , this will be done in its frame . &quot;
how long thir@@ sts for the uph@@ e@@ word ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
it depends on the involvement of the manufacturers and political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntary turn the car manufacturers on the topic of environment so far does not . &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the change@@ over itself could last in the workshop only three to four hours .
consuming can be it to get an appointment .
&quot; what do mot@@ orists not drive a car from BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE has to be waiting for the wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would consider , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
does a massive price fall from Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE feared that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where dri@@ ver@@ ings . &quot;
in rural areas there has so far no added value for older diesel .
the ACE bor@@ es with a sale still to be seen .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center @-@ Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the Gl@@ am@@ orous Events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets a first rap@@ per by one of the cov@@ eted prizes of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the Kultur@@ facility on Thursday announced , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , as well as the chore@@ o@@ grapher Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman LE@@ AR ( 95 ) . &quot;
the awards will be handed over in early December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; the awar@@ ding of the progressive TV series , announced by the lau@@ re@@ ate LE@@ AR announced that for the participation in the g@@ ala . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New York Times &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to completely neglected to the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them the means - and that is deb@@ ited from me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an empha@@ sized , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to restore her view . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy @-@ Center , according to the former president John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; the former price @-@ makers count Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues in pensions in the coming year . &quot;
the passage is already written - suitable applicants are r@@ ary .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been born .
and the work still makes him great fun as he conv@@ eys in the pres@@ seg@@ es@@ prä@@ ch .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also challenging tasks which are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it wondered that so far no application does not have your application requirements . &quot;
the city is currently looking for an architect or building engineer at the next time .
that is to be said - under the consideration of the regular cancellation policy - yet enough time to work .
&quot; since Has@@ l@@ ach stands for the administrative community as a sub@@ e @-@ rights agency , the applicant has to identify appropriate degrees . &quot;
for this function the city wants to keep in any case .
&quot; would they no longer be able to complete this , they would have to return the citizen to couns@@ el up to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but citizen @-@ harvest is the city and it itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good company atmosphere , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; for more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated over the st@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city alive , &quot; he is confident about the building office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ stages Park . &quot;
the Kin@@ zig@@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed even the stadium is still subject matter .
&quot; the latter alone will hit with around 1.5 million euros at be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; if we &apos;re making it right &quot; , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; due to a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , there is a large room . &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own belly yard and gar@@ dener can be quite flexible to react .
&quot; one can move much , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green zones will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what pur@@ ging , &quot; if new buildings are approved , stresses the divi@@ dend Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is Bau@@ mer , &quot; in the end everything goes here over my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years to Manfred Schön@@ er ( woo@@ fer ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , wishes W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good company , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , after information of the city of Has@@ l@@ ach , should have a completed study as a diploma and Bachelor &apos;s degree of expertise in the fields of construction and building planning . &quot;
&quot; the office building stands up of high @-@ cutting and woo@@ fer , construction planning , tur@@ key areas , management of urban loung@@ es , urban unit , and sub @-@ rights agency , including monuments . &quot;
riding bike on lines : south @-@ trail locked
&quot; according to the police , the blue @-@ known offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the rail network in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so heavily damaged that the descending freight traffic had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators pass away from two male perpet@@ rators and have been searching for the evening hours after them .
near the Tat@@ ort had been observed a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike @-@ driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itzer st@@ reich , &quot; said O@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the APA . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators brought himself in a great danger and also threat@@ ens the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the complex as well as the delay &quot; &quot; and the delay &quot; &quot; and the cost of rail transport could also come to the perpet@@ r@@ ator to the perpet@@ r@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; in total be of a &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south track could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost 10 persons , on Friday afternoon , there were two of them fr@@ aud@@ ited the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; goods were not sufficient , but they had a delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged at about 200 metres of head@@ lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammation of the intestinal diseases ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could rel@@ ieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 30@@ 0,000 causes mag@@ en@@ struggles and bl@@ eeding , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; during those affected , meat and dairy products are being used to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washing@@ toner University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contribute to developing human cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leit@@ ner researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to ensure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes that are hiding in the food not into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is too far toward inflammation , it can result in a inflammatory disease . &quot;
&quot; in experim@@ entation has been noted that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cells in mice occurs , which carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intr@@ usion . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium does need Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial @-@ art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had them of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition , toler@@ ant , less anti @-@ inflammatory intestinal diseases , if the same system also acquire at people . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ do@@ kt@@ or@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of study re@@ ws had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was divided separately , that did not . &quot;
&quot; you susp@@ ect that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the stomach @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ine of the mice were found DNA sequ@@ el and it were found six bacterial species that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them with the mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a ster@@ il@@ en environment so that they l@@ acked a bo@@ wel @-@ micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ th@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; to understand how the bacteria grow to the immune system , the researchers made L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then over@@ led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component has been cleaned out of fluid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers have double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of mice , the number of such cells has increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ tes@@ ters were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ adren@@ al products from L. reu@@ ther , the cells in people develop as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory intestinal diseases . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , because these cells control inflammation towards the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ dic@@ ation in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population .
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot; &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria had . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Cup on Tuesday began , and impressive in the holder &apos;s role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after popularity . &quot;
&quot; however , MAT@@ IC was excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia @-@ tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League @-@ season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
&quot; we will help him , sooner than later ready to be . &quot;
&quot; besides M@@ atic start@@ led also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent enth@@ used this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three other new li@@ abilities , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of his four top priority . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , thank you for the club , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great difficulty . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US @-@ plane @-@ car Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington , but drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the rad@@ ar La@@ und@@ men the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole thing was a gri@@ pper for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising earlier .
thus the number of &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ Logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new low@@ ance for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; however , as the wind is about : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still SPD boss , the Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister before elections were always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; just no Imm@@ fire from the Party Central , just no head@@ wind from the covenant - so lou@@ der the most important wish of the elect@@ oral fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the Party has fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff of the Willy Brandt @-@ Willy Brandt observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , the wind was not described in the approach . &quot;
there were ra@@ inf@@ all .
and one after another .
the federal CD@@ U look after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be sure , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
the surprising frac@@ turing of a green MPs has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a heavy crisis .
&quot; five months before the day of the day election , his red @-@ green coalition lost their three @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens @-@ Federal Minister Michael Kell@@ ner has promp@@ ted the Ab@@ sen@@ ess Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Jordan @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ ug@@ gen to return to their mandate .
the crossing to CD@@ U means a clear re@@ pu@@ zz@@ ling of the constitu@@ encies .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ acks must immediately return to her mandate , &quot; said the German business leader and election leaders of the Gre@@ ens Network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true yet , &quot; &quot; S@@ aving a SPD @-@ elect@@ oral comb@@ at@@ ant , as on Friday morning the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ ard@@ ship is reached the Party Central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green MEP El@@ ke T@@ ug@@ ging to the CD@@ U without its own ruling majority . &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD country associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly significant defeat at the Saarland &apos;s election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med the comrades . &quot;
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia would be different .
this was then - and even though it was significantly worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the pig@@ let , the Du@@ essel@@ dorf , the party smooth . &quot;
&quot; lab@@ orious , the comrades settled in the weeks after that . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just got new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next precip@@ itation .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD country , lost his Nim@@ bus , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he did in crisis communication , then quite everything wrong , what one can do wrong . &quot;
since then Schol@@ z is fighting his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW greenhouse gas and its role in the Super@@ visory Board , the Dutch prime minister stood for a long time in criticism . &quot;
mi@@ ese con@@ fr@@ ame@@ works were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps just that , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l tried to put up more and more strongly in the Bund . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former citizen of Hannover to develop his power in Berlin , he also remained hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant him because they spoke of the party to stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could enter .
&quot; in this case , Wei@@ l is at the im@@ partial internal constraints in the Gre@@ ens , basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz already did not .
&quot; therefore , the comrades try to keep his own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; your wrath is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here especially to the sec@@ ular parliament@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic and democratic , as wife T@@ wins their own career eating over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Party @-@ left in the SPD Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary campaign , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; MS T@@ wins is not yet chosen because of its person as a direct can@@ did@@ atin , but on the country &apos;s provincial list has been elected as the Lower Saxony . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD @-@ Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary campaign , acc@@ ents a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the constitu@@ encies of four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l for Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the decline of defe@@ ats as a leader in the Bundestag , the R@@ N@@ D . &quot;
&quot; now fal@@ si@@ fy the personal career of a future CD@@ U @-@ members the W@@ ah@@ ler Day , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he asked to clear the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there is further commitments to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
conveyor belts for the center III
those who want to have come to house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative of the city development on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave once a glimp@@ se of the past so far .
since 1991 there has been in delicate renovation areas .
&quot; back then , in the refurb@@ ishment of I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg also took over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still under 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous San@@ ings are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior design , and not only new buildings . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , one can get the information from the Prime Minister Karlsruhe to Karlsruhe that there will be a refurb@@ ishment III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount of 833 Euro , of which affects 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the municipality . &quot;
how does a renov@@ ations arise ?
&quot; you will continue to investigate so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also play a role , whether in the planned area should not be interested in any interest . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territory could also be reg@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; the pier on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; the cellar presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; in which frame the s@@ ages would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of interior cities , improving living and working conditions and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would object @-@ related , that is called per plot . &quot;
the san@@ itation area would finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the funding period for the funding period has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; even until September this year , however , the survey will once again be carried out , in the frame of those involved in the refurb@@ ishment , a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional period should be made possible , so that coming year with the s@@ ages will be started in the coming year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every Comm@@ une did carry out the said advance @-@ investigations in advance .
&quot; it is about to evaluate the urban planning , and decide when re@@ acts and to what extent . &quot;
for the respective property the property will also be registered in the basic textbook .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come once again , and get a picture of the situation , she spoke . &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of those involved . &quot;
&quot; therefore , questionn@@ aires will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and property bow &quot; &quot; where it is among other things about the building status and the renovation views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; can be made information on size , distribution and residents of a residential area . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; is only to fill if in the building business spaces are operated .
&quot; however , in mind , Got@@ zel pointed out that a solid questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new measures will not be eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler pointed out that the distribution of funding for the &quot; &quot; wind @-@ principle &quot; &quot; function - who comes first , mah@@ lt first . &quot;
you can reserve no funding for later &quot; reserve . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Locations II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tish invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand@@ ing movement in house and car
&quot; a bri@@ tish invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he opens his door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car with a hand@@ ing movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and foref@@ inger , and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify his life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ es@@ thesi@@ sts in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedure is performed after medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and only takes 30 seconds .
&quot; North@@ am also wants to change Cast@@ les to houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and for his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the promotional costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , to fly a marine helic@@ opter to the South La@@ wn for an event that cost the American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the specifications of the military which have been left to the T@@ IME magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the heart of the event was on 17 July in the White House with American construction programmes . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ opter was issued apart from a yacht of Maine , a fire@@ man made of Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft truck in Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helic@@ opter or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter at the South La@@ wn S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted that you are aware of this because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the vice @-@ offering for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helic@@ opter arrived on 17 July at 7 am on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long before , until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in this evening . &quot;
&quot; note adds that if the departure from the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to the restriction of the service lessons would require a second team for the return flight . &quot;
the original flight experience was during the event with the helic@@ opter while the security of the unit remained on the ground on the plane .
&quot; from the records made available from the T@@ IME , it was not clear if ultimately a second plane was required . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ atch Act provides national , public property for political purposes . &quot;
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event can hurt the determination .
&quot; one question we asked if it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; rep@@ lied the dep@@ uty command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts for cont@@ ain@@ ment of the government rules . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
Presidents are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
&quot; but their use only for a photo @-@ OP are demanding , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February as the presidential plane in the background of his first campaign ann@@ u@@ al@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ emented by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states shows that manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty pres@@ enter of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead training courses in the area around Washington and in South La@@ wn , to enforce the U.S. President in the White House with precise cen@@ timeters . &quot;
&quot; as Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led me at the White House 58 practicing land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event mat@@ tered during the training requirements for the month , said an official . &quot;
&quot; helic@@ opter units flew in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps , presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; an speaker of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved with the helic@@ op@@ ters in the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget design@@ ations for the presidential race , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D refund system amounts to the V@@ H @-@ 3D however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
records of the unit record the flight time of the flight than 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of the operation of the helic@@ opter lie far under this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for refund rates , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from the year 2015 , the refund rates for DO@@ D do not contain the costs , but take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former press pre@@ aching of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the Bundes@@ state Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I will assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp is inter@@ acting with the helic@@ opter when he entered his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man . &quot;
in the White House Tru@@ mp has talked to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

this is a compact team that plays always quite similar formation .

for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV provide above all the imports from the high north .
&quot; their plans and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup .

&quot; this is how always hard for us .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tru@@ mp did not , when he on Wednesday evening his signature put under the law of tight@@ ening the sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his har@@ ast , the law to en@@ acted , the Congress have put a few &quot; &quot; constitutional rules &quot; , &quot; he died . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ elled against the US crash . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft is to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; according to worrying , since then , investors have been funded by domestic O@@ MV that have been co @-@ financed with other European companies in the construction of Russian Ost@@ se@@ el@@ eitung Nord Stream 2 . &quot;
the dr@@ au@@ kul@@ isse is abundant .
&quot; however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil group . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp has had to bring sanctions into life by an executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are at their disposal .
&quot; the press &quot; has seen that the Group could rec@@ ti@@ fy , and which could really do him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed at the center of the Hit@@ ti@@ x in the center of Net@@ fli@@ x .
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bas@@ k@@ ill@@ ers is un@@ vei@@ led , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by stre@@ aming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the newest Bö@@ se@@ wich@@ es of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organization of drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ fathers , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une @-@ 500 company &quot; only with more state bri@@ bery and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; G@@ IL@@ BER@@ TO Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Alc@@ az@@ ar ) is its head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Francisco Den@@ is ) , the Mexican compound , and Ch@@ epe Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;

the role of back@@ wards : the city is 46 Kü@@ ch@@ enh@@ ances
&quot; the city is organized the K@@ ita lunch table , again . &quot;
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban child care centres the clock will be re@@ filmed .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld is taking over the eating area in the urban child care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again in its own reg@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy director in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; we all enjoyed very much . &quot;
cooked in addition to house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh @-@ cooled off .
&quot; the city operates in the region of 46 children &apos;s area , in 44 the kids get a warm meal for lunch time . &quot;
&quot; last kit@@ a@@ Year , 28@@ 00 Children at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; by now , not only children who are in charge of 45 weekend hours in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care , if children until 14 pm remain . &quot;
&quot; 46 Parti@@ al forces have from 1 September cooking service : they warm@@ ed the angel@@ ed foods , they complement the salad , raw materials and fruits , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food out , clean , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group @-@ group institutions - decides on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the chef are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the perpet@@ ual , ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy diet and cook@@ ery lessons .
&quot; the children should help , prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen is because useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the inf@@ ac@@ ement of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - will in the future be carried out by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also enjoyed the quality improvement of the kitchen , also the charm that it turned out in the cost of ownership and stran@@ gers to the city as the economical way it is known from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 sub @-@ contractors will be re @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall around 750 people in the guar@@ di@@ cal area not so strongly in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
&quot; a trade union would like to help with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ vend@@ or Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their factory in Glasgow , &quot;
G@@ MB Scotland said to weigh about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory in addition to other products of Hob@@ bs and Rich Tea Kek@@ se .
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the branch of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to tell , &quot; concerns &quot; that the financing of the modernisation of production lines will not be driven . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Senior Organiz@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , a key pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the increasing life of life and of the chronic production of the Glasgow , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently calls for a fl@@ ori@@ ental production of Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ ppo at T@@ oll@@ Cross has first received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to that since we estimate the continuous commitment with employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; we had two months ago a regular meeting with staff and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
we deb@@ ated with the staff that we operate as all companies engaged in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive .
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production place . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their trade unions will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ned three years ago N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga likes to regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti Area .
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not letting up in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after spending an offer of £ 189 million , in order to trigger his freedom of rede@@ mption , but have given them war@@ ned in Barcelona three years prior to the world case ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has raised the transfer window in summer , for the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds of Manchester United returned . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and to the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way , as N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside , although a source in the vicinity of the Catal@@ ans of Catalonia is that the club has always given its best to take care of it since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but the football world was war@@ ned of the PS@@ G president three years ago ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association who sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have passed this line , whereby the Spanish society expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti in the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of their prizes for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report un@@ load @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the abuse of claims resulting from Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report for mis@@ use with the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues to debate discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; concluded by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Kar@@ d@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse . &quot;
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep sub@@ om@@ is@@ sions about their own sub@@ om@@ is@@ sions or their then false evaluation of the processes .
&quot; the Vatican &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; however cri@@ tici@@ zed that in the reporting of violence in the cathedral @-@ cats with &quot; two &quot; measurement &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one knows that it is a sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; handle that would be pun@@ ished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ p@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; says the author of medi@@ etta Scar@@ af@@ fia , historians and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committees . &quot;
&quot; the habit that design@@ ate the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of the day @-@ day experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that is for normal , &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ af@@ fia . &quot;
also prin@@ cess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and that is a time of fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; moreover , they pointed out that in their youth &quot; &quot; saw a very normal educational means &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one , finished . &quot;
&quot; they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades , as the world have changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports about the abuse of abuse , the pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was often applied . &quot;
&quot; absolutely wrong , the author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann , who composed by R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protecting , &quot; says H@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he adds the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the educ@@ ator lawyer Ulrich Weber ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were found between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high degree of consistency , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ uses . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it is to say that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high Emoti@@ onal , the punishment of the students could also fall fier@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other alleg@@ edly , there were many sacrific@@ es the general humanity of R. sham@@ anic and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even connect positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report for mis@@ use sc@@ andal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explains his opinion . &quot;
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; Pre@@ face of violence of violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a conf@@ lic@@ ting image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; on the one hand , many students stand forth his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for another he also appears as a chol@@ cian and perf@@ ection@@ ist , that was more tangible when a domain was musi@@ cally no top @-@ performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his bio@@ grapher this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when you read the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one must ask yourself to ask why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger may be found at all . &quot;
&quot; he has just been dedicated to eight sides , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted by every suspic@@ ion of the mid@@ - or co @-@ kno@@ cking in the terrible cases sexual abuse . &quot;
also the non @-@ violence in the pre @-@ school occurred outside his activity .
&quot; it is possible to throw him at the same time , too late , or have not taken the initial indications taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ th@@ ence , on which he worked , was viewed by practically all respon@@ dents said - so literally &quot; &quot; rede@@ mption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus , the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; Kek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons , and always lag@@ ged from grapes from children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about his perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high emotional ality , which also has led to hum@@ ili@@ t . &quot;
&quot; that he was not only dump@@ ed with chairs and cast the s@@ nat@@ ch , but also ear @-@ fe@@ eds , and too fre@@ che boys in the hair or ears , he has already been given to years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and exc@@ used for it . &quot;
&quot; however , to its honour , however , must be said that such educ@@ ator methods in the fragile time , the 1960s and se@@ ven@@ ties were widespread , in parents like with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think of each one of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a world @-@ wide school , a state gymn@@ asium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it actually goes in this report , namely , the ign@@ ite sexual abuse and non@@ violence at the pre @-@ school , are the fre@@ est@@ y bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; you ask yourself if it does not seem to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ V@@ I. , that many media has just got on him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood him , still eager . &quot;
the truth but is : the report un@@ load Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , the report was reported much about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the Final Report also led to any contrac@@ tion or co @-@ kno@@ cking in terms of sexual abuse at the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual gri@@ ps claims to have become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; I have never dr@@ unk with my father or mother to talk about it , &quot; said a subject for the others &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the real problem in clarification of sexual abuse was and yet is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they do not even familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how to evaluate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a respon@@ dent lear@@ ns him so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which it would have had been written ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely findings and could have stopped the respective offen@@ ders .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd , embrace that ... Bub@@ ble inv@@ aders or more explicit or more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory , Trust , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to a very clear result : &quot; that concerned with the students affected , and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; what sexual abuse affects , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is to be released from every fellow @-@ knowing . &quot;
&quot; thus it cannot be thrown out , nor could it be prevented or taken to the display . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to connect his good name with these contradic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media was a lot of &quot; &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; &quot; to read the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown in the report &quot; away . &quot;
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big issue that in the process of reporting everything mixed and mixed to a huge mel@@ ange out of sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of dr@@ ine , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is precisely the abuse of the report .
&quot; namely , there will be clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gram@@ mar school of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covered waste from the time since 1945 , thus also out of four decades , where Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the chor@@ us of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful exam@@ inations , the cases , in which cor@@ es of s@@ adi@@ sti@@ ff teachers were fairly chi@@ pped and mal@@ ign@@ ed , un@@ event@@ ed off at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to have . &quot;
&quot; but with whom dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger did nothing to do , for he got the boys only to face when they were already on the cathedral @-@ level school . &quot;
&quot; in it was like most witnesses emphas@@ ise the theme &quot; &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; one was only happy to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states . &quot;
what was different in the domain of judgment ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but not a s@@ adi@@ sti@@ cal violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims are committed to the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even connect positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; so , at the most other still the accus@@ ation remains to have been washed away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was responsible for a school at which he didn &apos;t want to listen and responsible ( such a witness ) , and then again in 1993 . &quot;
wear Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ arten , the report is even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in this he pointed out that , &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school , he continues to be practiced in the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative media , he received urgent consent . &quot;
&quot; that was of course at a time when I was legal clarity , in Bavaria too long ago . &quot;
&quot; before , it occurred in a legal gray area , like everyone of us probably know . &quot;
there was difficult to estimate where those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the per@@ missible limit was exceeded .
&quot; but one can not say , he would have always washed away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the test was officially abol@@ ished in schools in Bavaria .
&quot; prin@@ cess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standard to the dam@@ aging time . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians talk there from the &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger to evaluate the present @-@ day moral standards . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has already right .
&quot; of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was vile and not for what was broken during the pre @-@ school and violence against inno@@ cent children &apos;s school , which is already far beyond the evil . &quot;
&quot; this is all very aw@@ ful , and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I must take the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. ear@@ marks and in the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment then it was forbidden , he also has strictly ab@@ ide by it . &quot;
what image of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger Time has changed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in discussions with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ?
did the theme exam@@ ines also to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , says from his perspective , there the cathedral @-@ cats played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not at all that he led a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said : without these perfection , without which in@@ demand un@@ conditioned discipline , it would probably hardly possible to form an institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g , true cultural amb@@ assador Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not make a big singer and every success , just in which area , yet always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger when talking to their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I already met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep unbeliev@@ ing and sincere people , from which one could not imagine anything to do something . &quot;
&quot; I regularly receive how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is still today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ zing , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat it as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t forgive him until today , so he was very strict with them , so are clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; most of the cathedral @-@ cats are grateful to him today , that he enriched her life and has delivered them to the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ous teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ectable person , to which they still have a look and to worship them straight . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clear : everything you conc@@ e@@ eing him , the educ@@ ator methods that were at that time on the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just one man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sinn@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; there is the bad intention that stands behind it , just too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , un@@ load him . &quot;
&quot; now the attack would lie , a 93 @-@ year old man who acquired great mer@@ its and would probably not be familiar with the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
