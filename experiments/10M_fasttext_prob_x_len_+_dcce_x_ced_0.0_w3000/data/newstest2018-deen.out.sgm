<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards to change the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren Anstalt where young people can meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a Gruftkapelle, where now is used for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the blasts of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not currently up.</seg>
<seg id="7">"this knows everyone who had to rain from time, because the car-Navi instead of a hystary street showed a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the government, are far from the current one - but that is why very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the towns and communities in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flickwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large overview map for cities and communities were dealt with more detailed cards, so-called Urpositional leaves."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were made according to the declaration of the state administration between 1810 and 1864 and skip the first Vermessung Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader in Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished to get an overview of the occupied country and gave an topographical reception of Bayerns into order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops moved to the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: there were today's neighbours who created the idea of an extensive Bavaria-map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drive forward the project, founded the" topographic Bureau "" and thus the Bayerische surveying administration. "</seg>
<seg id="19">The first positional sheet for Munich is from the year 1856 and is like the other one on the website of the Bayerischer National Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the comparison of fruits / Today, the capital of the state capital is the most impressive."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has extended itself in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was established 21 years after the creation of the map, so 1877, as a coin."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, subsendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses underneath focus around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße which was named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: in the first glance: in writing, a small disadvantaged card will appear with dozens of lines and figures: handwritten numbered Flurpieces from the so-called" "plot of" "from which the property tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no farmers more - but small gardeners of the complex "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterized by the north of underendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 Schauplatz of the October Court, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete form in the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of the present District Au-Haidhausen, one does not only read the road name" on Gasteig "or from the" "height" "- but also in big letters" Irren Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, there are once more people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was 1858 / 59 the Münchner Circle-Irrenanstalt" "On the Auer Lüften."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Gudden the institution - that Psychiatrist, which was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended for example the acquisition of the so called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he is forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has dedicated himself to an exhibition of the Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients had first been place, later on 500 seats were expanded."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chalsirrenanstalt in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"there since 2006, the Isar-Amper Blaikum Munich-East, is one of Germany's biggest psychiatrists in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the field of the former Auer Anstalt, young people will encounter young people in Münchner Salesianum."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order was built in the Assembly of 1920, and turned him into a youth-heim with training."</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football field of the TSV München East, east residence houses from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015 you set up the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "- an arquitecture to the origin of the Irreneged, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in Bombenattack."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was around 1856 as a" main square "," the purchase road was called "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Bombs of the Allies in December 1944 many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a sevening chapel standing from the Middle Ages was once at the Marienhof, where these days were the pre-work and place on the 5th April 2017 of the spatenstich for the second S-Bahn course."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the sliders, the old Munich card can be compared to the aerial photograph of today - and the hole in the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group released out of travel for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of coloured has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling on the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state after Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state Missouri, which should enter into force until 28 August 2017, as a number of fragworthy, racial-based deposits in recent times occur in the whole state and can be noted here," says it in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes it more difficult to win Discrimination, as well as the criminal authorities of the state, the disproportionate effect on minorities, prompted the group to come out the tour, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that people happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are raised because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear discomfort in such an incidence, which we have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning which has issued the organisation for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents like racist merging against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"unlike fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having had no gasoline during the journey through the state, and was taken in custody by the police of Missouri, without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also indicates a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Office of Missouri, in which it is shown that black motorists in the state will be more common than pasture."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be willing to bring it to fear or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate speech in 2015 after the latest figures from the Hassan breeder-reporting programme of the FBI which sets the state with regard to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"the itinerary is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACES) took place in Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigration laws passed, the local criminal law enforcement authorities aimed to suspend people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to the ACES to further rattle."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel orders are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but in recent times we have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Weighaunching project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Weighacher Weighaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Peter White and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the Ristle of the Schwendemann family representative of the Fisherter CDU-local association with Major Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann paid first insights into his farm, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and also houses many young animals, and also houses in five apartments resort guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">The "black milk" is for him the alternate marketer marker for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests occurs exclusively regionality.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he signed the Weighaunching project as" elementary. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not be profitable on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the founding area for a lot of work, much mts can be edited with the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the terms and conditions and with the topography," stressed Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the elastic operation and managed without any chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not lead a bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the Weimar project, and is pleased with the leader of the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers must be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the reforestation of the areas could be moved still quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thinking about how they continue their operation," "said the Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers stand often in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, more than 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the open surface area amounts to 40 hectares, which are not allowed until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total of €71, half over Leader was promoted, a quarter carried out the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, they love the farmers 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of Weights."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," declared Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and landrows it does not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter white stood firm," "here are the best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscaling Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg makes the state support of white fence.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisites is the presence of one of the superfics signed by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"moreover, the constricting surface may not be conclusive (Hanging over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"by 2018, Weighaunching project 2018 is currently running on the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres from Zaun."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open surface corresponds to 35 hectares, the kalculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">"now, the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transfer is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the careless fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad, in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic quarantine with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals by the President to the drastic restriction of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself. "</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of Boatowners and Liberty Imitators had gotten him paralysed if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he took their significance, and in particular the importance that you have been written, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta, I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that the world illuminated."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem which you refer to, which was later added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly properly properly, but as he formulating it, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the inflamed words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest people, your arms, / your beverted masses, which are looking for, free to breathe / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time, in which the" elous waste "was better to see on our screens."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict in the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who put themselves to place their words after their death at the base - did very good that they have accomplished a high political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicans by pointing the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she is himself a very different name: mother of Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people wanted to withdraw from the right wing this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big messenger as Rush Limbaugh, a sort of Johannes the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty doesn't redeem no one but rather an early neoconservatives that bring American flamme into the rebound world:" Lady Liberty is moving. "</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to carry the torches of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not supposed to shine the way into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is limbaugh here on somewhat engraved.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus insisted in it to see them as they were seen from the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travel to the Decks of ships was seen."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is about the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people, looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is of course not the perspective, Miller and Trump ever wish to recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"your torch is not supposed to illuminate the way, but the hate, who is their only source of power, ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black loges Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two villi belonged to the team of Britain.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-heads-old confederation is to make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" in Scotland "" something special "" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it. "</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand and we will continue until we find it," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athlete think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athlete are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will compete against Sir Mo Farah during the 5.000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is pretty modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"your captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the genuine feel, the Eiliie brought quite naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth-Silver Medal, who will compete in their fifth world championship with the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 villi are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which was achieved in 1983 and 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-stream Muir leads on this road and has five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metres rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another shot, which one was included in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">"Doyle is reminded of her first World Championships, as the only other Schotte in Team Lee McConnell."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the teams of capitalists says that they are" "proud" "of the fact that many of their land-members are not only part of the team, but in some cases also in the medals and at the Finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special about team captain's team is in it that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour, but knowing that my team-mate voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we got.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it, that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from critics about Facebook: beating you not a public office if you cannot wear the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our land knew something of poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the American loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers brought him because of everything from the inner policy up to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shocked in criticism, safely."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumm, and mute we shall take the sheep to the battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"it brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defendant him from the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Stab of the Governor did the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a return trip with" "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is astounding.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the highest ranking of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary head-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his constituents and to debate his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore the blockage of individuals come to the site of the Governors - which is a public forum that is considered officially and by collaborators, which are paid as officially, and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the blockage of the comments is nothing more than a moderator.</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the picture of trolling or spammers or hwater-filled people, which swinging the Peitsche."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a entrepreneur and a pastor, no troll."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor zipped the Bible in his post and appeal to Hogans catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserted, but she asked for hate."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hassany and other latest news," she wrote in the commentary box of the message "" The Post. ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people takes position on the same subject, then they are misused by some more than such a collective collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected people."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the governors are called" "concentrated Spam attack," others would probably call "" intercting "." "</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook-era makes it simple, cut a message by blocking a critic or a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in a past time, if one had done the same that staff were kidnapped to collect newspapers with critical ladders and to burn or burning demonstrators, and to bring silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials that he criticized Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accents by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter's Feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County is the first Amendment of the Loudoun County, according to the U.S. District fier James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they were entitled to a voter of their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky received Governor Matt Priin (R) also a visit of the ACES because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so heavy.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the moment of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar impact on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter to his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, the pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "," wrote all letters of newspapers, the Washington's decisions. "</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions to criticise its position on the contract of Amity, trade and navigation with Great Britain criticised his ministry, according to the historic documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put it to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, differences and discourses belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means to accept this.</seg>

<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Stef of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of news media - in the hope to hold the boss on a equitable course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Stef of the White House, he met his first working day with leading staff, he presented a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: bad information that enter into the hands of the president."</seg>

<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to watch Trump by monitoring its media technology."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship with television ranges back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television application is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if Candidate Trump was upset because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince," said the former election adviser Sam Nunberg in February towards the Politico. "</seg>

<seg id="1402">Perhaps these warts know something we do not know - that Trumps Tweets without their intervention would have even more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the Tweets which has not sent the Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff had already made it a few times, to maintain away from him, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"but no one has to prevent it consistently, that Trump controls calls forth."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a white house composed of competing parties, always trying to advance their own agenda by promoting Trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - primarily deals with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants, the President of strategic reasons, beyond doubt."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-Beams say that Trump can react to negative press releases, especially those with damaged leaks and that he discusses how these come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this happened at the end of February, when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateurs Charles C.

<seg id="1411">"although Johnson were banned from Twitter due to Shikanen permanently or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he is voiced in the past and revoke it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask staff about Walsh.</seg>

<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly attempts three months later to do the same.</seg>

<seg id="1809">Assassination of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet up to check their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">"it has been told to them, that it is important to change its routines."</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feel safer: they should take their children with the office, who were the target of an attack with granulates, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: adversal, Neutral, Verbund."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions, and belly."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug regulators, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are digested to stand on the secret list of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no relaxing break from violence, and throughout the country the corpses, are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 began his office. 589 are facing at least seven deaths in seven States this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her editor and her inspirer is by Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist, wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence will be felt deep, although his presence everywhere exists - a large picture of Valdez, which shows his midfinger with the word" "Justice", "hang on the façade of the Riodoce-building. two reporters in the three-time, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, which have his ridiculous face with glasses or its typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss about its shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 a Sonder-Federal Office was established in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of Morden, which are linked every year with drug trading and organised crime, the murderers of journalists will rarely be put to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on to treat the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are unobtruneastern and even though the terrain is now slanted."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little value for discussing the security, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very dumm to wasting my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we mistruate all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the City of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed just to go a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla has been halted by two men. he was forced out of his car, presumably due to the name of the newspaper - the" "twelve-known river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap was away by car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to be free from Culiacan-free.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But to the subject of Valdez it is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the delivery in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battens of the country, since rivaling groups fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not make that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people can be shot across the street, or that the cemetery is full of mixed, two-story mouse-ceen drugs, which are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" "tranquility" "if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first in February the release of a interviews with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalating carton in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gear members bought each specimen of the issue as soon as they were delivered to timberkiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second error was to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper which had released the same story to leave the country into its own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He has survived so long that his friends and colleagues were annexed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined the founding of Riodoce with five colleagues and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without having to come to the predry problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"in time, the newspaper earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took place."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to publish tough studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else could handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the formation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "Maria-Moors-Cabot" "for their coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, where ever she has led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to live on," he said to the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"Drugs in Sinaloa" "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV. "</seg>
<seg id="1854">You must assume the task which falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what did you do in view of so many dead... why did you not told what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missing Valdez, the spawn-bird, which was like a port worker, the friend, who knew generous with hugs and advice attacks, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted with his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry out his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, go and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"well, ask them: was his love for routine his inheritance?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also has forced them to ask her own assumptions in question, how they can best do their work and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret start and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-ensorship and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">To trust his own instiners.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" smell is a sense that can be mistaken... and then the thing with Javier happens. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are in Sinaloa no more - just as not as in Tamaulipas, VERACRUZ, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt governance."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly there were no phones allowed. days previously was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively by governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were protecting the heat from 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">"they were commissioned by the State Government, the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class district of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers, who signed the governor itself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters had gone into the mountain landscape, where the drugs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce has broken down on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of the brother of the former famous boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had a Exposé to the state, concentrated on the hometown of the Governors."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was one group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor's office."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy player, the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (Pri) heard that almost all the political planes ruled by the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several Pri governors were accused of highly-employed cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about predominant incidents in this eatery, including one where a son of" El Chapo "Guzman went a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months ago the readers had seen the Kolumne of Valdez as the most informed source about the abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "" El FLACO "because of its slender body."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was dedicated to storage space for signs and stickers, dedicated to the Morde of journalists, because the employee had become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">The Reporting Miriam Ramirez shook a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared and three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is his."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become more louder by being written in organized Protests" SOS Press "on the walkway and construction."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, director Bojorquez weg in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa in the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez seized the authorities, journalists and let them move, because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since been asked that she is once again divided from the government, because she is concerned that her anger has injured their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime, are involved in government officials and an equal society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco-Journalism" "he wrote that the reporter are not only killed by drugs, but also on the command of politicians and security organs, with organised crime against a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"the media" "Articulo 19" "launched more than half of the attacks against journalists of the police and officials in the past year."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico stirred you, because they want you disproportion the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the Morde have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border-state Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1904">2010 was the Diario de Ciudad Juarez openly to the drug card details on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>

<seg id="1907">It's hard to find work in exile and watch them still the streets and look for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted how it was apparently murdered by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, the 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico-City three months after the flight from VERACRUZ."</seg>

<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce on the sidewalk from the office and drank beer, when all their telephones began to sum up once all their telephones began."</seg>

<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-fresser is the best preserved Fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine in the vicinity of Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something, which seemed to be done from the surrounding rocks at the place, and decided to look more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil fuel discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animals within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy mineral pump."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just had a bit with the eyes blinzeln, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist im Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the science of knowledge as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs specimens - the mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this crop-eaters, although he is covered with an armor and a changing tank, probably threatened by flesh and send dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly frequented dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from predators, and used a shielding technology that is also used as a counter-coating, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to dove its enemies, saying experts, which indicates that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old Kreatur from the family of Nodosaurs has made headlines in May for the first time and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it Borealopelta markedly named Borealopelta Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing conservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists who document patterns and the form of scales and armours through his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shady, a common defensive method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature darker was as its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shady usually is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it pointed out that the dinosaurs has been hunted by enough pressure through meat-vore dinosaurs, the evolution that favoring the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals, which put the counter shady - do you think of deer, zebras or Gürk - are much smaller and vulnerable as prey, which was signalized that this nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong prey-behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the crayon time," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was red-brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on references to his life, including its conserving Darminate to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs died, when he died, into a river and turned out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as the south florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with preservated skin skin, but also in three dimensions, and the original form of the beast, said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early circle.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much fantasy to reconstruct it to reconstruct it. if you just have a bit with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is at sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the crayon time was a time, when giant theropoda, carnivorous diness barrier that arose on two legs the earth had gone through."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"though the king of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrible ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists who appear to their latest findings in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta injured after death in the sea and in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine in the vicinity of Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the owned dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armaments, and is completely from muzzle to the hips."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"contained two 20-inch-long peaks, that raged by his shoulders."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armorant crop-fresser was blown by the Western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater perception of the dinosaurs kept his armour in an exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved, that the hood become still holprige tank-plates along the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the Lotto."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after having arrived in New York City, sat in St. Louis Parinnate on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it still lies on the road, called it there."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as no one else was posted on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly prayed on their Timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., killed live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of browning body that was stretched on the road and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," thought Ferrell at himself. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their fellowship.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone in order to return later in the evening to tweet about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people, the cried, and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription:" Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They observed a live-feel that a policeman was in front of a group of demonstrators with a rebelliant dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said that another policeman his rifle and crying:" I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual, remember her statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to and which we can name typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shakes.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return trip and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing around 23 o'clock she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father, and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "" in the cinemas from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and Protestant, love and loss of resistance, strength and resistance, which is from the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to request answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, which was a floral dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two got a conversation that she had countless times in front of this morning, about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she reminded me of what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It has to know and to be seen and raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience an ecatant racism, it is not different from the next black women."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel it, I would prove her a bad service to keep them far away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when she arrived at Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp site, when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local partner."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new kind of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has been totally changed after 9 August, she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health benefits in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in the organization.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell arrived during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the Co-director of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question was Ferrell in the sense:" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism has been nourished by countless cases of men, often of whites in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan explained recently in an interview:" "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices were not centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already worked together with the then Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field, which is known for its activism by death-tract inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought the project closer together with six other natives followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after the shooting of shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"it was the main thing for me how these people are presented, for so I will be shown."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that it is in the movement" not to a messias leaders, but about a community that comes together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrer's life as she loves himself and her wife marries.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I have understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work, and in the understanding of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells history is the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of movement, which were marked after the killing of black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012 the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as sultry."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, pregnant women need to carry the main load of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan atmospheric to remark, that" the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not a affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who burned this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront, because when living on these crosses as a black, pregnant woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson has long gone, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to persist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on granting for 2 ½ years due to the blockage of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a mess."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless they clashed against a singing, and she feels committed to this memory, since she went into Ferguson the street three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">"from" "dream" "to" "size wahn" ": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery"</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves the people, although it is not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern dividend of the pedestrian precinct since the first presentation of 2009 the population in supporters and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject can hardly be one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"as the one to the bit gallery say:" "this would be a dream" "(Nicole Becker) or" "that would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "does not need a human" (Siggi Baking) or quite simple: "" size wahn! "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents build on it that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which also the other businesses benefit, fear the opponents of the pedestrian precede."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery will be built exactly on the property, on which the market hall is being market, in the 13 direct market-market products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will be concluded with the start of the construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Galerie-Macher want to integrate a market hall into new building - in addition to the Beda-place with opportunity, to the outside seats."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "we have been buying almost every week in the hall market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the land rejoicing always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to make sure that during and especially after the construction of the gallery, there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt, is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether direct market-market in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">But this is likely not likely to be low at the new project.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what advantages in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothes, shoes, drumwear or supermarkets: I find it superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shopstores here are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that we will at least get the markethall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is also very inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, stores are requested in a shopping center only by bigger companies because the dorfuses are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special, there are almost no more and what is left of it, will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a market hall fits for me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the farmhall building during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even when the bit Gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or is it possible to sell all the shops of Bitburg in advance?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this is simply not working.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, there is no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmarker hall it thanks to the wahnsiness many - as I find - sensuous construction projects in Bitburg is no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"if the peasant market hall is made, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost indifferent - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfar and Haarlem who have been sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison fort Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analytics analyst had made a 35-year-old prison sentence, after they made a secret diplomatic reports on the website WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition that was opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was transformed into its professional competence in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and pioneering discourses, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithms of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, a sharp, if something intellectual comment could not only be interpreted in the form of DNA data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the indurated determinants of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already been spoken for their puberty above the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 because of 20 accusations, including six violations against the espionage network, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"by the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a granny, black-white Selfie, in the Manning intentionally is sitting on a driver seat and has a platinum Persian has been associated with which it was also associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012-project "stranger Visons."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist portraits produced by strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette mute and chewing gum by producing a picture of how these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a time-mail.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they carried an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany any kind of portrait to accompany this article," declared Dewey-Hagborg at a press show of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA-portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their incarcerated Muse have become unequal penpal that has been exchanged for several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo Illustrified Comic" Stockressed Images, "which would be foreseen a future in which the president would shake the verdict and she would be able to personally see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released, Manning release returned to seven brutal years in a military coup in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is even now at the opening of the exhibition a bit deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government of government and against transgender-troops to find new, tweeter ways to fix the rigid divisions that he should actually remedy."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as Dewey-Hagborg after the strange timing of all of these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"on a wall of the gallery of written artistic statement called Manning with its superbig signature including (the" "i" "in their family name is equipped with a heart) an end to the" automatic fracturing, the basis of sex, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written by Cs and GS and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotids according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological sense, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring with it is that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories can also be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room is one page from the above Comic Novels mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how they emerges with a free phone in hand from the recklace of the United States as King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech, then they have won,"</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote me," "said the artist who greeted in Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get gearing, when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it should be looked forward in the comic book - but when they should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, which unite like hordes of the protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted, as everything is written in the exhibition until the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), which were written with a pencil on their genetic haplogroups. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd-set," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels with Chelsea, like the movement, which also hidden behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumbs on the side of a letter that has been written by a double-day in the 1700's years, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2304">"he hiked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with Landscape, gardening, and sometimes with the artists who worked in the illustrations of his book."</seg>

<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was only received the full access in 2006 as the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are connected with each other? "</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought, that it would not be even more crazy, a new report comes about technological developments in the area of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritized professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernagel."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny about it, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">"modern Sexes have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone, which feels warm, with deliberately human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence."</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can adapt its robots even according to its beliefs, and select everything from the eye-color of the robot about the shape of the nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but there is still more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities, "that would be a Stepford woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexes have developed to robots with a silicone.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics which they are appealing, such as students."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with pre-programmed figures such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of students and" Wild Wendy "with a" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the site of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"she likes what you like, and she may not like what you do not like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">She also has her moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "in mood!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submised female characteristics, the backlash on rape if one goes a step on Frigid (said here: conflicting) Farrah goes, beunquiet a most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibration but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibration, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "it is on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex-robots are not just a fetish or just another sex."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing refinement indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal equality of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course have no sex robots, and while the FRR noted its increasing popularity, they still remain temporary at the edge of the consumption culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what happened from the boundary, can be in relation to the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not weird or offensive, until they are the free market to do so."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is however a certain remcision, that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a while in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which the White House gives a president who has heed to have women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most awful aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the sleeves body and the stolen eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these Sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornographic proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their builder wants to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can not separate or walk from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no placement or a background history, nothing that could disturb on independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">Other words: they are faint slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrases of 2017: maid</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammation of the intestinal diseases)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000 causes magenstruggles and bleeding, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"during those affected, meat and dairy products are being used to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contribute to developing human cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leitner researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that damaging microbes that are hiding in the food not into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far toward inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experimentation has been noted that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cells in mice occurs, which carry a specific bacterium in their intrusion."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium does need Tryptophan - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial-art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had them of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of Tryptophan rich nutrition, tolerant, less anti-inflammatory intestinal diseases, if the same system also acquire at people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of study rews had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was divided separately, that did not."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"you suspect that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the stomach-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestine of the mice were found DNA sequel and it were found six bacterial species that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them with the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterilen environment so that they lacked a bowel-microbiome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells and they received the L. reuthi and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria grow to the immune system, the researchers made L. reuteri in a fluid and then overled small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component has been cleaned out of fluid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-metabolism that is known as an Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers have double the amount of tryptophan in the forage of mice, the number of such cells has increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptoptesters were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach-intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-adrenal products from L. reuther, the cells in people develop as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory intestinal diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, because these cells control inflammation towards the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophandication in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report unload-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the abuse of claims resulting from Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for misuse with the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to debate discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement" We are Church, "concluded by the former Regensburger Bishop and today Kardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the Benedict XVI, an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep subomissions about their own subomissions or their then false evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" Osservatore Romano "however criticized that in the reporting of violence in the cathedral-cats with" two "measurement". ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the grips in Regensburg, no one knows that it is a shameful and shameful deeds" handle that would be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of medial manipulation", "says the author of medietta Scaraffia, historians and member of the national Italian Bioethics committees."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit that designate the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of the day-day experience and prepares the public opinion that is for normal," "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we are happy to go to the church and that is a time of frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"moreover, they pointed out that in their youth" "saw a very normal educational means" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one, finished."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they are unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, as the world have changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports about the abuse of abuse, the pope-brother Georg Ratzinger was often applied."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"absolutely wrong, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who composed by Ratzinger the reminder" My brother of Pope "(translated in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protecting," says Hemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he adds the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is in the 440-page report, which was presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the educator lawyer Ulrich Weber?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were found between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high degree of consistency, 67 Domspatzen sexually abuses."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, it is to say that from Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high Emotional, the punishment of the students could also fall fierce."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other allegedly, there were many sacrifices the general humanity of R. shamanic and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even connect positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann, why the final report for misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger explains his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the "Preface of violence of violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a conflicting image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students stand forth his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"for another he also appears as a cholcian and perfectionist, that was more tangible when a domain was musically no top-performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when you read the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one must ask yourself to ask why the name Georg Ratzinger may be found at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"he has just been dedicated to eight sides, and he is clearly acquitted by every suspicion of the mid- or co-knocking in the terrible cases sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the non-violence in the pre-school occurred outside his activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to throw him at the same time, too late, or have not taken the initial indications taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengthence, on which he worked, was viewed by practically all respondents said - so literally" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus, the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger describes a very excellent testimony," "sincere", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "Keksen and Bonbons, and always lagged from grapes from children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high emotional ality, which also has led to humilit."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he was not only dumped with chairs and cast the snatch, but also ear-feeds, and too freche boys in the hair or ears, he has already been given to years ago, deeply regrets and excused for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to its honour, however, must be said that such educator methods in the fragile time, the 1960s and seventies were widespread, in parents like with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think of each one of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a world-wide school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it actually goes in this report, namely, the ignite sexual abuse and nonviolence at the pre-school, are the freesty bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you ask yourself if it does not seem to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI., that many media has just got on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, still eager."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth but is: the report unload Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report was reported much about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the Final Report also led to any contraction or co-knocking in terms of sexual abuse at the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual grips claims to have become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never drunk with my father or mother to talk about it," said a subject for the others "" It was all very embarrassing. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in clarification of sexual abuse was and yet is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they do not even familiar with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How to evaluate the Domspatzen-students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a respondent learns him so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which it would have had been written (Georg Ratzinger) timely findings and could have stopped the respective offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd, embrace that... Bubble invaders or more explicit or more open than to their parents, dormitory, Trust, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to a very clear result:" that concerned with the students affected, and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"what sexual abuse affects, Georg Ratzinger is to be released from every fellow-knowing."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus it cannot be thrown out, nor could it be prevented or taken to the display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to connect his good name with these contradicting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media was a lot of" "non-violence" "to read the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown in the report "away."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big issue that in the process of reporting everything mixed and mixed to a huge melange out of sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle of drine, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there will be clean separated: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and non-violence, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covered waste from the time since 1945, thus also out of four decades, where Georg Ratzinger was not the chorus of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful examinations, the cases, in which cores of sadistiff teachers were fairly chipped and maligned, unevented off at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to have."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger did nothing to do, for he got the boys only to face when they were already on the cathedral-level school."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"in it was like most witnesses emphasise the theme" "Vorschule" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"one was only happy to escape, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" paradise "states."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the domain of judgment?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but not a sadistical violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims are committed to the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even connect positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at the most other still the accusation remains to have been washed away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was responsible for a school at which he didn't want to listen and responsible (such a witness), and then again in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Wear Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of Domspatzengarten, the report is even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he pointed out that," "that in the pre-school, he continues to be practiced in the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative media, he received urgent consent."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was of course at a time when I was legal clarity, in Bavaria too long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before, it occurred in a legal gray area, like everyone of us probably know."</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was difficult to estimate where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one can not say, he would have always washed away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standard to the damaging time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians talk there from the" "pitfalls of Anachronism", "thus the danger to evaluate the present-day moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was vile and not for what was broken during the pre-school and violence against innocent children's school, which is already far beyond the evil."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all very awful, and I am glad that it will finally be reworked."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take the Georg Ratzinger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplining and punishment, i.e. earmarks and in the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment then it was forbidden, he also has strictly abide by it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image of his Regensburger Time has changed Georg Ratzinger because in discussions with you for the book "My brother of Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the theme examines also to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, says from his perspective, there the cathedral-cats played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not at all that he led a stricter regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said: without these perfection, without which indemand unconditioned discipline, it would probably hardly possible to form an institution of Weltrang, true cultural ambassador Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone, one does not make a big singer and every success, just in which area, yet always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced for Georg Ratzinger when talking to their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I already met Georg Ratzinger really well and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep unbelieving and sincere people, from which one could not imagine anything to do something."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly receive how many former Domspatzen is still today, 23 years after his Emerizing, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat it as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who don't forgive him until today, so he was very strict with them, so are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"most of the cathedral-cats are grateful to him today, that he enriched her life and has delivered them to the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, väterous teacher - a stringent father, certainly that may be - but also a lovely respectable person, to which they still have a look and to worship them straight."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clear: everything you conceeing him, the educator methods that were at that time on the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust one man, just because he is prominently and has an even prominent brother to make the medial sinners."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the bad intention that stands behind it, just too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, unload him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the attack would lie, a 93-year old man who acquired great merits and would probably not be familiar with the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
