gol@@ fers Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyram@@ ide
his experiences on the horse are persu@@ aded .
at the end of a golf player in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sear@@ ched with some colleagues a bit of variety with a horseback ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyram@@ ide &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses reminded of their holiday , they h@@ unted in the fast Gal@@ op@@ p home to the feed . &quot;
&quot; a few kilometers at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the Reit@@ k@@ arri@@ ere ended then again .
on Saturday Germany was best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament si@@ ege - back in the vicinity of horses .
he allowed himself to run with his family on the facility of the AL@@ RV on a horse he didn &apos;t want to comment on a horse .
&quot; for a long time , the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports help sur@@ passed the man from An@@ hausen as part of a little g@@ ala on the Gol@@ dene Sport@@ pyram@@ ide .
an award lack it to the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; Bundes@@ minist@@ ries , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already car@@ ded him .
the 18th Prize winner of the Sport@@ pyram@@ ide .
&quot; at Aachen , he met the first prize winners of Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means me much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for spor@@ ty successes but also for social engagement . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger encourages the offspring .
&quot; and thus , he also gave the prize money from 25,000 Euro to the same . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men the two @-@ fold sports@@ men was taken on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; among the excellent , Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the Spring@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the Spring@@ way Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part the illustr@@ ating society went into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the great animals .
cl@@ int@@ ons and Tru@@ mp@@ s Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure and to prevent the TT@@ P trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two US presidential elections are however in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental survey . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
that is about the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ned that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; Clinton concluded the economy to death and regul@@ ating death , he says . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , he himself would be quite different from the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely return to regul@@ ators , and he makes himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax movements - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton says : the state has given certain duties to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich increases , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the rivers , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost wor@@ ris@@ ed . &quot;
the democratic evaluation announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure is classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ of the republi@@ cans of Republi@@ cans .
&quot; so on Tru@@ mp , there might be even partial internal discussions . &quot;
differences in energy and climate policies are evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power plants and resume its carbon reduction in the United States .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; Clinton will explicitly aim to strengthen the renewable energies with their investment program : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies , and millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ ying @-@ fish trade agreement , they do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US does not want to isol@@ ate the international trade - but not just American jobs . &quot;
the should then also be better paid for about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a cause of hunger .
he wants to raise them up to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp does not want to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must r@@ enter , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on one side is Tru@@ mp who wants to boost the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
&quot; his critics keep him before , so the household deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to say at least from the rich , that they will pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
&quot; escape : &quot; &quot; every woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who fl@@ ee alone , almost to everyday life . &quot;
&quot; if they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed . &quot;
a house offers refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has placed her little son in the arms .
he flo@@ cked with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother st@@ amped on the tabl@@ etop plate .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles just and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene appears normal .
until you speak to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is an area of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a support for social aid services in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are spot@@ ted .
they live in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment along with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Frau@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; long ago , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guar@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : any woman who arrives here , has done on their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men fl@@ ee because of wars because they are politically prosec@@ uted , because they are torture or death , or because their families send them as Hoff@@ ors to Europe , &quot; &quot; tells her . &quot;
&quot; for women over@@ cast other reasons for the flight , &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced , honesty , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end as soon as they are in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , women in refugees would often be considered inf@@ eri@@ or and worst in refugees . &quot;
&quot; this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the Munich &apos;s accommodation in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner north , it appreci@@ ates her . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women were so unusual that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; since they often do not help to help you need more accommodation just for them , asks B@@ ahr . &quot;
in Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; on the question whether she is going from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is such a thing in accommodations of governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Schw@@ aben are not separated alone , women were not separated alone , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the Government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are in some common areas of floors or own homes only for the women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study that was released for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; if privacy or men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it may come to - continuous - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the washing rooms should be separated and accessible for women to be easily accessible in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women felt in need of this protection , one can read in the urge to get it to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around for around us , we have a long queue , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
Assi@@ stance : demands for new labour measures
&quot; Deputy Chairman of the Assi@@ stance have called their union , new labour measures for their disputes with their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded his entire council , starting at the beginning of September more labour measures . &quot;
&quot; J@@ DC said that the ministers had refused to address the concerns regarding the contract .
&quot; assistance in July about the rejection of a contract , who agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to members who was published on Twitter on Thursday , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government would have remained calm &quot; &quot; problems which resulted in the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board also voted to reject the proposed new contract completely reject and official re @-@ negotiations about all your needs . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today asked a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to escal@@ ate a continuous programme of escal@@ ating work measures that begin early September . &quot;
&quot; the dispute led to that Assi@@ stance , this year Six@@ sm@@ al disputes , the first overall inci@@ dents in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A Assi@@ stance Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana stood after the election to reject the agreed agreement conditions , which were recommended by BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which were still held before the vote by 54.@@ 000 Assi@@ stance and medical servants , with that the contract should be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Minister of Health was Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the Treaty of doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of aliens &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands and an official end to the eight months long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ party in the Golden Hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in receiving , I cannot deny me that Ankara won &apos;t want that reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles sm@@ alli@@ ed , and he had little heat from himself , even for his return conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , in contrast , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard so , as if never had anything better . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite to indicate .
&quot; but one of Putin des@@ perate , sustainable cooling showed that the State of Russia had forgotten anything . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introductory article : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was wast@@ ed .
Putin shared and accused Ankara , Russia fell into the back . &quot;
&quot; the going was even bigger , since it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vet@@ r@@ ust will build up again becomes difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; months later the state controlled media led a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would carry for everything to blame .
&quot; serious alleg@@ edly were the alleg@@ ations of leading officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which have been controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has disp@@ uted this veh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received Erdo@@ gan &apos;s excuse for Putin who wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a c@@ eas@@ ef@@ ire is clear on the hand .
&quot; Erdo@@ gan requires first and foremost all friends , which he can get after the last month at a failed state of nearly his ministry . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have taken Turkey hard - especially the pro@@ hibition of charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is reduced by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are added again . &quot;
you count on a bel@@ itt@@ al An@@ storm in the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week projected the state @-@ of @-@ watching fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agri@@ business are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report to Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulate it : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West since it considers its reaction to the tried to look out a weak response .
&quot; in addition , the persistent p@@ ll come about the Sn@@ ail of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ping to pull the cool mood and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; the Russian state of state gained a bonus in Ankara with certainty that he called for the tried @-@ rich support for the elected state organs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ known for Moscow , a self @-@ comprehen@@ sibility that itself has a deep @-@ sitting fear of regime . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace made clear by the sea for Russia and Turkey , one as a analy@@ st once described as an an@@ al@@ ysts , &quot; &quot; alliance of aliens &quot; &quot; : two lands that come from the West and feel poorly treated and now hi@@ des . &quot;
&quot; however , in spite of public reconciliation , between the two still great differences . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently been playing the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey were opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after nearly three hours of initial discussions , both Presidents spoke at the press conference , that they had not even shed the subject . &quot;
&quot; the president of Turkey announces it to answer a question about its differences , while Putin decided to stress them . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of an open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potenti@@ als for a perfect dis@@ aster , when NATO member was held by Turkey on Russian fighter jet , it is certainly better that the two heads of state will be at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the R@@ BS , the R@@ BS brand is said to be reduced to an Back@@ office . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since then off@@ ish itself as she had almost collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; in this period we have used brand@@ y &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; to protect other end @-@ user brands . &quot;
&quot; they supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ bl@@ edon winner Andy Murray . &quot;
but now she has decided to move more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the IP@@ O will change to Nat@@ al West . &quot;
Ul@@ ster Bank &apos;s brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller brands for private customer business , which are more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a visit of visits to customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors as well as the brand , among which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now , that we do not pursue global targets , but local targets . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities for something completely , and our employees will work with the customers among these brands . &quot;
&quot; R@@ BS has already said that the Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing will no longer continue , and that it will increase the perc@@ ep@@ ability of different brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop the brand of the brands , for how do we focus within ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Pre @-@ St@@ ef . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very Cypri@@ ot three years ago , when we had said we would have been a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can back these marks again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieved to pre@@ dil@@ ection its 3.@@ 000@@ ten profit in New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spr@@ inkl@@ es champagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ ten prize . &quot;

&quot; he set on pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ lar , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Itali@@ ans is the sixth point of Jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ wick@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ fourth winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who before she won on G@@ hay@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; I am very happy about that it has happened to New@@ market , because I am here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a bank@@ rupt Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ er on , when he reaches victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection . &quot;
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the barriers - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ painting winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4.@@ 300 wins in a rec@@ ord@@ breaking career .
&quot; n@@ ester Pig@@ wick@@ t , the nin@@ et@@ een Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ eers &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of the modern and there is no surprise that he reached this milestone that only a few minutes before him have achieved .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that is different from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for race , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma loved fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie in front of a few weeks in Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 profits , if he would not only be a weekend and Grand Masters ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has donated almost 30 years of winner in the UK which is great .
&quot; he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a brilliant race , but in addition he is an incredible adventure . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ mo@@ unts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British fl@@ ags for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole range of major tournaments , including its famous &quot; Gl@@ ory Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had difficulties , when he returned from his h@@ ub@@ on@@ ati@@ gen lock , but he showed an impressive size to beat its branches and to return to his order form . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori previously said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia Putin feu@@ ds St@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian president Vladimir Putin has dismis@@ sed his Stab@@ ur@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the narro@@ wing of trust by Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin without giving reasons &quot; &quot; dismis@@ sal Ivan@@ ov@@ s arranged by his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential government . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was signed with Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tallinn , he made his mark at the renowned State of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was a log and representative manager of the government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of law , and to support checks on the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV broad@@ c@@ aster on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked about to leave his post and v@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the ridicul@@ ous faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysti@@ cism .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as a St@@ ef he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; during a meeting with President Putin , that was broadcast on television , both men said that the St@@ ef resign@@ s on his own desire . &quot;
&quot; but despite the paraly@@ sis for the cameras , here are only few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is the result of a sort of power struggles ?
I currently knows no one .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion , that a man who once was referred to as a potential president , who once again lead to the Russian environmental policy - came into great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks by Putin , c@@ ited on the website of the Krem@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - they could almost say - compl@@ ain@@ able post four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been Chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Minister and Defense Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service of K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , as Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who was appointed the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his representative . &quot;
&quot; as Putin , he called to the power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he most familiar . &quot;
&quot; once was believed that Ivan@@ ov could become the second term president of Russia , since a third term of the rule of Putin would encounter the constitution . &quot;

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ a@@ du@@ kt - which means the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four con@@ cluding the &quot; cover boxes &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge @-@ section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 bul@@ ls . &quot;
the £ 1,35 billion project should be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; economic Minister Keit@@ h Brown has made a visit today , and was one of the first that went from the land to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &apos; this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of a engineers , of a truly ep@@ tic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton concrete and steel , which alone was used alone for that part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the tear between the Vi@@ a@@ duct and the Br@@ ück@@ ende@@ ck is a pag@@ an activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the whole Br@@ ück@@ ende@@ ck at its place and the last section of Dec@@ ks now gets a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be taken on the bridge to its place . &quot;
Michael Martin , Project Officer of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first lock is a significant milestone in each brid@@ ged project . &quot;
this fantastic project provides the forward @-@ setting forward @-@ looking forward @-@ cutting and woo@@ fers .
&quot; after installing the last street cut and its connection to the expansion of the north deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north side or the country side . &quot;
this was achieved by drag@@ ging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , since the vi@@ a@@ duct is 222 metres long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be drag@@ ged from about 3 % to the top . &quot;
&quot; hot , since the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , tiny , - on each side they rested only a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness still alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown by her fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI ambulance station proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in security while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat was close to himself and set us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the b@@ ail@@ out station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds used the boat out of its range until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was spent at the age of 60 and was found in a bo@@ wel without b@@ ail@@ out . &quot;
they came all on board the coastal path and were brought back to the b@@ ail@@ station .
&quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot @-@ engine had a stop@@ over , however , that trig@@ gers down the boat from the person , which controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has awak@@ ened over these men today .
difficult hurt - man sti@@ cking on his ex @-@ girlfriend .
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; as the police yesterday afternoon , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the crus@@ ades of the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when they came into the apartment , he came twice to them twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was in@@ ju@@ red at hand and at the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old , the clothes of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ armed then his sister .
&quot; together with their lives , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that &apos;s why she went out of the house with her life .
on the road they met the ex @-@ lifestyle of the male .
&quot; when the two women ro@@ ught the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old is his sister to the side and took hold of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building Br@@ uns@@ ure favourable apartments ?
&quot; in future , the SPD and green my : investors should be put into duty more closely in the future . &quot;
how do you respond to bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 affordable housing in the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing to the next R@@ ats@@ meeting , a &quot; &quot; concept &quot; . &quot; &quot;
however dispute is programmed .
primarily it is about the question : who is supposed to actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is already lacking .
&quot; SPD @-@ Fr@@ ac@@ Chairman Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , in future 20 percent of all apartments are intended as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be made in stock . &quot;
&quot; the big dispute settlement in the town hall is however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you want investors to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of apartments build as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban residential construction program , which will cost millions costs and has to be financed , is to provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U intends to make investors as much as possible .
the left wants to get tough@@ er runs for investors .
&quot; regardless of , as Brat@@ mann , b@@ ane is a tight@@ ening of the situation on the market market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff will be needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
&quot; however , the program is not entirely : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; how do you compare the loss of further approximately 1300 apartments , whose support will be run over the next few years ? &quot;
500 apartments alone will be up to 2020 alone .
&quot; to prevent this , the plan@@ ing policy of Nicole Palm , should now be purchased on ongoing bonds from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , we would have to be thought to pick back home back into the price . &quot;
this is possible in the western town .
at one stroke the problem solve the problem .
&quot; for in the western town , for the year @-@ to @-@ end time period . &quot;
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments . &quot;
&quot; only : we want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; after all , the number of social housing in the western town is dramatically increased , from the goal of so @-@ called inter@@ ming@@ ling . &quot;
a concentration of social dis@@ advant@@ aged in only a few neighbour@@ hoods shall no longer be able to give it .
the Gre@@ ens therefore count that there will be a movement in the discussion .
&quot; Group Leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must get into the boat . &quot;
I concentrated on more construction sites for family houses .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; that teenagers and child can no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens , was star@@ red in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Po@@ k@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and get more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and finally limited to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters , which were first created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later , resulting from a drawing series , game cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop@@ kultur sank in the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
&quot; within a few days , Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphone out and look for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons who are followed with a GPS and once they were found &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( via a screens@@ hot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was even younger , joined the w@@ ahn and sp@@ rang up for the look of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that stimul@@ ated the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ og@@ ram , an app for Apple Watch , prosec@@ uted the 35.@@ 000 users , the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days of market launch of the game , the number of following people followed by 45 percent to 53 per cent . &quot;
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data to improve performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to bring about 30 minutes to take &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; every day to be active &quot; , &quot; because lots of public messages to health are boring and coming from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the significance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drive sport , reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; however , the wonder@@ full of Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that people can do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people even join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as always there is also m@@ ür@@ ur@@ ian play@@ sp@@ ans who must always complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
it has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps could follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sport as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and will leave the use with time .
&quot; however , because of Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons , there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and helping many people on hunting , more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

on the entire line brilliant .
and now finally Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ erin .
the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ ner in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ level title and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ lamp of the Olympic Games .
&quot; your overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly stated in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ er@@ kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ esth@@ ood Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es are located on the Swedish p@@ sich@@ ord during the single multi @-@ level of women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; it is the fourth heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Americans who wins a multi @-@ campaign title , and in total the fifth , while it strengthens its reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; it broke out in tears , as their final result was shown , and her long journey at that moment found an end . &quot;
&quot; this success puts them in the same League as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has won over the last three years her sport , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ lady from 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on of her said that she is &quot; the best Tur@@ ning in which I ever saw . &quot;
&quot; it was expecting her last test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden @-@ dimensional expectations . &quot;
&quot; not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas will return as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace their gold and silver in the single multi @-@ level of women at the Olympic Summer Olymp@@ ics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , won . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ ly took the first medal on Tuesday , while they were served on the far@@ ewell party who served in the Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as excer@@ pts . &quot;
&quot; although it insi@@ sted on it , during their long crossing to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their ground exercise - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music to match the home on the street outside the Olympi@@ ad arena in Rio .
it is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was adopted by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gymn@@ asium , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man , became the power . &quot;
&quot; it has been no longer @-@ battle competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning series which will hold for as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina led by two screen@@ ings , dec@@ ayed the picture . &quot;
Swedish bal@@ ms and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which it holds the World title - lau@@ ded .
she got up again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the float again - and sat down with an 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground yet .
&quot; R@@ ais@@ man h@@ ug@@ ged them gently when they were expecting her end @-@ out - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow to Bil@@ es sh@@ iny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision which they were used once in their collecting @-@ book , to reality . &quot;
&quot; the power R@@ ais@@ man was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze statue in a Ti@@ eb@@ r@@ ake went to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team has been called &quot; &quot; gran@@ ny &quot; , &quot; which is called by the Americans &quot; &quot; gran@@ ny &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their ground exercise , she cast them to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ es , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which was sometimes dubi@@ ous . &quot;

police : 3 victims in serial case to music in the car
&quot; according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first series of first series of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela La Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a crossing , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators dam@@ med eight shots from a hand @-@ fire @-@ weapon while it stood on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another car , is in the report to read . &quot;
&quot; the police told that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder not seem to be the result of a boot@@ leg , since the att@@ acker doesn &apos;t have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the barriers to the investig@@ ator has abandoned , a closer look at whether they are linked with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , mostly in h@@ is@@ panic dor@@ sal were killed in nine attacks seven people and two others hurt . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; distributed Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ ll@@ ac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators devi@@ ded themselves , the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , became hosp@@ it@@ alized because of their injury and died later . &quot;
&quot; Lin@@ er , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness shared the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities published also a police report on the shooting , which turned on an empty pick@@ up truck with half an hour before the triple murder and turned out by that it was the work of the serial mur@@ ders . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ ae and in@@ sured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball frag@@ ments from the engine space .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it is better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his age has Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto did not know . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought , I managed not . &quot;
I did not create this .
I did not let myself let myself .
&quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left it on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her has been told that Ed@@ mund can never realize it under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they sw@@ allow him to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; my first response to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund was neither sitting nor cr@@ un@@ ces up to his third year and he can still not speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and ride bikes .
he likes to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something ahead of it . &quot;
&quot; we bring him character in , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical drawing language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as mask or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how the life of those with the c@@ avi@@ rus inv@@ ests will be influenced .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of a un@@ certain future .
I wondered what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she is still not white .
&quot; I have no longer asked for the progn@@ osis for a long time , because I am not expecting to tell me someone really . &quot;
&quot; but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful couns@@ elling for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects , which were caused by the c@@ avi@@ rus . &quot;
it is better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; also , three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
&quot; the boy was built on the front of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical condition , has been fin@@ ed to the transm@@ itter . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police are determined whether under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators .

it seems that they are clearly re@@ acted to a continued struggle .

&quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters here , who were very active involved , shared police skin p@@ man Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di police in Philadelphia . &quot;

&quot; it was no fixed , and the police have been reviewed yet , according to the monitoring video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year girl had arrived at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she recovered and the police are looking for a suspic@@ ion .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine among the Frauen@@ oly@@ mp@@ i@@ am@@ ian in Tur@@ n and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I &apos;ve joined the Olymp@@ ics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three tur@@ ers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , inspired for many young girls of other skin @-@ color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ kin , off @-@ round , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has paved the black and h@@ is@@ pan female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female Tur@@ ner@@ ers was a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising sign of the Olympi@@ ad and the Americas .
&quot; now the world was able to be a witness of the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ inen . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone is the fourth , heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Americans who won an individual multi @-@ campaign for women &apos;s gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the tip of this sport , but we do not see the classes in the whole country . &quot;
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all sm@@ ote the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it to the Olympic Team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; last Five &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will have only four turbines in the crew . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that exercising is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner in the first place in private trainers who are maintained by parents , for training , furniture - clothing , clothing , and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their Tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be done in any number . &quot;
the majority of these trainers lie in af@@ flu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these verses the Tur@@ ner will receive your overall training and that is for families an expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we need to be inspired by the communities of au@@ n countless , young girls , which are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a high @-@ borne and easier access @-@ training exercises . &quot;
I have founded my turn@@ able foundation of 20 years .
&quot; with my events , we have offered free and affordable tur@@ f in Harlem for more than 15,000 ton young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ian ) , and trained national and international winners . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics to learn and benefit from this great oly@@ mp@@ ic sport .
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and primary and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , the thousands of young girls to make it interesting for the gymn@@ as@@ tics , and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team and thanks , F@@ ass you motiv@@ ate so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;

&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , called for assistance to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working conditions do not achieve anything of the only little , strain but already excessive teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nursing and their families only concerns , need and break . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we talked to the Committee of Assi@@ stance and responded positively to the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries , positively to concerns about the tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as discharge , flexibility in training , training holidays , and the gender equality in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;

culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness leaves election in Muslim regions
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on dismis@@ sal of a government report due to corruption from the office .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to this broad@@ ened election was kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es does not attack the police , elect@@ oral experiments , and Rath@@ th@@ es to have ignored evidence of elect@@ oral abuse on the basis of &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; to eth@@ ni@@ cs and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and Communist government , which is now a cor@@ rup@@ tional struggle , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be allowed to set out in@@ consisten@@ cies outside of elect@@ ors . &quot;
he recommends that voters should have a withdrawal with themselves to prove their identity by elections .
&quot; currently , a vot@@ er must simply call its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not remot@@ able Tin@@ te on the finger of a person when they give up their constitu@@ ency , to prevent someone cho@@ oses . &quot;
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to the simil@@ arities and decisions of not official comp@@ lies or working groups .
&quot; this is not only for election amo@@ unted , but also the municipal government in front of the broader cor@@ rup@@ t@@ - and financial bet@@ aine culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets El@@ ectives than in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special optional court decided that the acting mayor Lut@@ on was to be cor@@ rupted after a L@@ itan@@ ei and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ished the religious feelings of his Muslim Community , and he had per@@ ished his critics with R@@ acial and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the relative duty of Muslims to choose him .
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dubi@@ ous or the result of a im@@ itation , by which a person cho@@ oses as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud across the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed particularly alar@@ ming for fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent brief@@ ing - when the older members of the Muslim Community have made pressure on people to choose a Candi@@ date of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to don@@ ate the elect@@ oral system , including the guide of evidence to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; as proof was attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was ex@@ erted , especially women and young people to choose according to the Will of El@@ ders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ical or ban@@ qu@@ ake background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions such a behavior due to &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ sensitivity to the eth@@ ni@@ cs and religion should have ignored .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to don@@ ate the system , including the pro@@ hibition , that political activ@@ ist letters process in order to stop &quot; &quot; constitu@@ encies &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration tests to prevent that the elect@@ oral directory is used for immigration and social fraud . &quot;
&quot; draw options into consideration , voters prior to election according to your credit card . &quot;
&quot; not remot@@ able ink on the finger of a person use , once she has released her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses . &quot;

ban that political activ@@ ates complete let@@ sel@@ ections and transitions from brief@@ sel@@ ections .
the police have the authority to set de@@ duc@@ tions around election stations .
&quot; a legislative change , which facilit@@ ates an indic@@ t@@ ment for inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the repression of the People Act 1983 ( representatives of the 1983 ) . &quot;
photographer offered in elect@@ or@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; requirement that only English in the voting stations must be used ( with exception of Wales ) . &quot;
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the staff will rule out that voters do alone in the elect@@ oral . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls about the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower of Ham@@ lets , there is no criminal off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; the elect@@ oral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for due to a L@@ itan@@ ei and illegal practices as unt@@ ested , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a series of reasons for out@@ lining , according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - guilty . &quot;
he also cri@@ tici@@ zed the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ insp@@ ections &quot; of the Con@@ duc@@ tions of the Town Hall .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part of Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears as the mother of the parli@@ aments , a proud heritage , but the worrying spread of elect@@ oral and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are over this week about the French bi@@ sport@@ sman Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except Rand and Band who has turned out to be an impressive bla@@ det in the Duke of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one to gam@@ ble gold fights , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if you can give the social media faith . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ our@@ ing the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ pped at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ ans who have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holl@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the hunters and the Wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Double @-@ on the Rad@@ r@@ enn@@ bahn , there are many people on the Internet to look like some arch@@ ers of the Twin @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison has an An@@ storm on Twitter , after pictures , on which he looks similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact the ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media , and gave to that he has already heard since his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , shared Br@@ ady of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I think that is the ac@@ compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly become the focus of the simil@@ arity between the British fores@@ jum@@ pers Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should go through as a double @-@ predecessor for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the southern African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .

&quot; another an@@ alogue comparison was made between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ lich , who pointed out to the same severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before the weapon
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to walk with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are looking forward from the front or rear , this video will show you how to rot@@ ate for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when you turn back from the back then you should turn out to be a pen , so that you can see your att@@ acker and embar@@ k on the line , &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then suggest him so@@ ak with the knee in the cor@@ p@@ ses and rot@@ ate , while the ag@@ gres@@ sor is smo@@ ked , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the running into the face and move back back@@ wards , while she will judge the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; att@@ ackers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the line , take the gun and turn it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , you shift the weight to the gun and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then rot@@ ate the weapon from its handle , before they move back and set the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is mi@@ ra@@ chi pre @-@ power .
&quot; but remember that it is on the safest , your money is too rich - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;

&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to physicians and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left , what he hid , more than a poor after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of its intest@@ ines by the world traveled and peculi@@ ar as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public funds to train stations up to dish@@ wash@@ ers of rest@@ rooms , the task presented its immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; he told me : &quot; &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ worried what my health concerns and I put all kinds of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and sk@@ amm@@ ew@@ age . &quot;
in the film he was looking for his reputation .
&quot; the only thing he distr@@ acted , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
his pro@@ l@@ ab@@ ed showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ isation of over 4000 units .
in comparison to that the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ isation is fresh in less than 60 .
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to dismis@@ sed after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ isation over 4000 units was , while fresh@@ ly washed hands of less than 60 &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish maker of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel movie &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the bacterial transitions at different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; this comes the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot;
there is no more dirt than that !
&quot; I will not miss here , because it is here inside . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company features Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Fre@@ il@@ us , which includes both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D , to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ kov@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we carried crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by that we ended up that we called &quot; L@@ ass us Ian call . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide the consumer more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who introduced the director of the film , added : &quot; let me say it - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he could have reli@@ ed some of things , just like the ek@@ el@@ ective Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to them , they anz@@ ul@@ ecken and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies to film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 per cent of all surv@@ ey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria are especially associated with the well @-@ being of gast@@ ric and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally use products that include lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;

the family were settled and it is believed to live in a private accommodation now .
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they feared that the apartment is no longer to repair . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was for people here an absolute night@@ mare and I believe that people do not have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered not so beautiful part Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had been put the family , in@@ timi@@ d with bas@@ ins , in@@ timi@@ zation , drug abuse , and excessive scre@@ ams , streets and flu@@ ence . &quot;

the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication were che@@ ered by light@@ ened neighbours who said their lives to Hell .
one said : &quot; they took no one to anyone . &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are amazing . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it had odi@@ zed the family with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police were called in regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the municipal area , tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that there is the ten@@ ants to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family , since a delic@@ acy is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing is taking into consideration . &quot;
that was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extremely difficult and had to be able to see their actions for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have gr@@ asp@@ ed to us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
I hope that the development of some neighbors will give con@@ sol@@ ation and the message is given that anti@@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .

many guest rooms of the house were lubric@@ ated with gr@@ aff@@ iti .

&quot; Angela C@@ row is shared by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , that the dolph@@ ins may be a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that don &apos;t hold on to the house order . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can accept without self @-@ pre@@ matur@@ ches , as well as those who have been forced by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;

&quot; a rare moment , in which usually large sp@@ ur@@ ly and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ bear is something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; after spending 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , the doubts expressed in its success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have vast problems in Utah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ ical Christians that he asked for support in major federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; to blame the false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Republi@@ can High @-@ bur@@ ns
Utah is normally a safe bank for the republi@@ cans .

&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by far the distance that are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia are also applicable .
&quot; in an interview of the Senate CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp rep@@ lied with Tru@@ mp on the question how he wants to stop the R@@ ise Cl@@ int@@ ons : &quot; just as I have done it before . &quot;
&quot; and whether &quot; &quot; &quot; : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; he does not make anything else , as &quot; the truth to tell . &quot;
&quot; if it &apos;s not rich for him at the end for the reason of political correctness , be this in order , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
then I returned to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to Press@@ views , the Party of Tru@@ mp refers to the support of his election campaign , it should not be able to present no better re@@ frac@@ tional values . &quot;

&quot; in the Orch@@ est@@ ly , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ts Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have am@@ ber &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging was Bart@@ oli an older mess@@ ted Maria .
she reminds with melanchol@@ y to her lovers with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there was Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is clever , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character that I have as Roman in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously @-@ to @-@ day person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ d is for him a necessity .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his gl@@ ances , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip WM . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; : &quot; in this piece , it is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have taken the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ories came to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same themes , and they are just as expres@@ sing as at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after the family of her family shortly after she had rep@@ ented the war of war and to return to England .
&quot; you can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that are the risks associated with it , to go into a war area - people ever stop this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school ma@@ ids came from the east of London in a plane in direction of Turkey and subsequently into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;

Turkey : Kur@@ dish community counts with mass refu@@ ge
&quot; those who don &apos;t miss and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed caffeine , &quot; says the presidency of the freight @-@ related foundation dialogue and the world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
the Kur@@ dish Community Germany is counting on short notice with ten thousand people seeking Germany from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the middle @-@ term , it could even be &quot; some hundreds of thousands &quot; , &quot; believes in the association , Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard approach of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup , the Kur@@ dish Community expects a mass refu@@ ge to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in short @-@ term , I reck@@ oned with tens of thousands of thousands of thousands of people from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says Chief Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government already passed through Kur@@ dish strongh@@ olds with criminal transactions , were 500,000 Kurds in Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the put@@ sch put@@ sch still s@@ oc@@ ular and op@@ positions ethnic Turks .
many are going to re @-@ start in Europe if they are further suppres@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that has itself to refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the association de@@ pressed the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
so Erdo@@ gan wants to increase Erdo@@ gan pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradi@@ cated or driven in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the association called for the German government to be as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan , and its followers . &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; Hex@@ en@@ hunting &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
&quot; more Turks will look for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the brand@@ ed as a wagon @-@ p@@ endant of teachers and other academ@@ ics are the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed caffeine , inci@@ dentally , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , leader of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported on appeal on figures of the Federal Ministry of minist@@ ries , the Turks presented itself before the coup the greatest group of the consequence of political persecution recognised in Germany . &quot;
&quot; for the time of June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all the als are entitled to be eligible as asylum ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , not be found before war , poverty or less@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; asylum authorized according to the Basic Law is only political , thus by state @-@ of @-@ hand side , individually re@@ followed . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; to then , where it does &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia must not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the day election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for that as far as far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and counter @-@ ri@@ cious battle - this is reflected . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the elect@@ oral struggle , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not native , so should not choose the land day . &quot;
&quot; these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers that rel@@ ies on posters , ballo@@ ons , flyer , and en@@ umer@@ ated at the end of the voices , only aw@@ k@@ oll . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the elect@@ oral and last F@@ eri@@ or Day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again leave a campaign for just close to the people of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot stage , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it also goes to something : Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 The strongest party , is now in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting is how strong new@@ com@@ er Af@@ D dis@@ cuts and what remains at the end of Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ st@@ aug@@ ust .
&quot; cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous elect@@ oral campaign . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , spread ros@@ es and chat a little with the people , as it did already his legendary kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
otherwise seaf@@ ering has gotten cold feet and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the blame on the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of sp@@ sp@@ op@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful position . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its peak data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz Caf@@ fier , has already experienced how it is when you make at the wrong time at the right place . &quot;
she has invited two ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to his grand@@ children ; Merkel &apos;s German Chancellor lies in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group was not , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as a Meckl@@ en@@ burger and Mecklenburg . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other states , called Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it is too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ the@@ ast CD@@ U largely disp@@ ens@@ ed on the usual election conditions on market positions and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and air balloon . &quot;
&quot; that , so does co@@ ert , play only one &quot; sub@@ ordinate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also the Union has ham@@ mo@@ cked that in the country , the base has pushed away , that it has to be very strict , to find a wire back to the people . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the times of the country barely exist . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U pl@@ ung@@ ers co@@ iled to his fellow @-@ co@@ il , however , is also self @-@ evident : &quot; &quot; they must go to where it does , namely , where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene weddings , every Birth@@ day party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is standing on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called for a particularly dedicated elect@@ oral campaign . &quot;
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still made clear with 35,@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small parties with seven percent in the surveys , should be able to create the leap into the land day . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtue of the vacation in need of modern virtu@@ es , and put it on the internet for their election . &quot;
&quot; online elect@@ oral campaign , &quot; says the state CEO Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the green elect@@ oral campaigns set off for local stimulation than among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top @-@ can@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hom@@ boat through the Moravian lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; Leg@@ ality in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ renov@@ ations : restaurants suffer from blocking
&quot; speed , with which the B 27 is sandy , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the buil@@ ders working at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and only at 8 pm , there is all enth@@ al@@ ises praise . &quot;
&quot; they did all pretty cl@@ ack@@ ly , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff by the Jet @-@ Gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no hiding place .
&quot; the job@@ site could be scheduled at the weekend of the weekend as scheduled after the south , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; blessed shall also be the discharge of those responsible for the building , for example , when it comes to setting up containers . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the South , the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted , and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is back , the traffic situation inside the place relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 to both sides .
the traffic traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; says the General Assistant General Manager of Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ land@@ rain had been struggling with more traffic noise , because a lot of swe@@ eping paths sought and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to that maneu@@ ver trucks in residential areas are fran@@ king .
&quot; as well as the speed b@@ umps are not respected , the community demanded the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable over@@ exc@@ eeding , &quot; says King who himself made himself the situation on the situation . &quot;
already two to three per minute have been scored .
the fastest was on the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; for the construction site , it is more quiet . &quot;
&quot; for busin@@ ess@@ men on the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg . &quot;
busin@@ ess@@ men have not like to look into the maps .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ hau@@ l has led to sales to sales , everyone who asked to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; , &quot; thus for other companies , for which the refurb@@ ishment has little consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight decline , &quot; but also that of course is missing &quot; the pro@@ vocation is missing . &quot;
the most exploited are the bars along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the teachers made it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was missing the clients from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Wood@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we have to be happy about each Euro turnover .
the revenue bu@@ cks rose to &quot; far over 50 percent . &quot;
the road marking have thrown its operation &quot; by two years back .
half of his employees have to be released .
&quot; if I have had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , the policy would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , ruling president Jörg Schmidt has on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there might be a financial balance , with the note , the guest house benef@@ ited from the advantages of the location at the B 27 Now , it also involves the dis@@ advantages that result in its refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other country circles , where so much vi@@ als has been managed . &quot;
&quot; with all the charges , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that its hospitality will continue to pass . &quot;
&quot; after all , family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now have to look at less frequently because of the complicated transport show less frequently , it can understand . &quot;
&quot; if one cannot walk , it is also quite different . &quot;
&quot; that his stem cli@@ ent@@ el comes back after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , then G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 building on its customers for the greatest crisis which has experienced its hospitality in their long @-@ term history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction , this is already brutal . &quot;
permanently on behalf of the terrorist fighting against laws is bol@@ ted .
after the recent attacks the Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has now been a thick@@ ened security package .
but what has a d@@ ull status to do with terror ?
and what does the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ aries say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the c@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; political , &quot; said , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
you do not demand anyone .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
even for this short notice I was doing .
&quot; but as an inner minister , however , was placed in the results and at a &quot; &quot; fin@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère reported a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach before he presents his conclusions for the safety of the Republic .
but the fall are all the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known , announced , announced that there is a new security authority to take care of the b@@ aking coded communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany must implement several EU specifications on air passengers and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for safety authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; partly , de Ma@@ int@@ ère starts a second title for proposals which have not been able to do with the SPD up to date : he wants to impose a sympath@@ iz@@ er for terror groups among punishment and jiha@@ dists with dou@@ bling of the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; spatial the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still consider it to be reasonable , and I also ask anything that I don &apos;t have any chances in the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ aries . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they are partly in themselves : he plans to shift kno@@ cks for deportation and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people from deport@@ ations .
&quot; refugees , which are targeted towards the country , should let their smartphone check @-@ in and open social media account for a safety deposit . &quot;
&quot; for exp@@ ul@@ ties for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or their pap@@ er@@ ers to wear their identity . &quot;
some of them is politically and legal .
&quot; also , even un@@ balanced , and leaves questions openly . &quot;
and in some points - when un@@ equal treatment of puzzles for example - raises the question : what does this have to do with certainty and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
yet it can &apos;t be asser@@ ted that the attacks were of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees .
many people in view of the high refugees are worried about safety .
&quot; and things that the people were deeply busi@@ er , but were not cl@@ oned in a choice of election times . &quot;
internal security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attack in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the insurance is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elect@@ oral struggles . &quot;
Union and SPD is therefore becoming increasingly on position in the issue of internal security .
over the past few days there went up between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ sty contro@@ versy over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons of the Federal Minister , in which the R@@ ess@@ or@@ ages will also call a bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able tones .
from a return from the one @-@ pass it is nothing .
we have edited the discussion in Germany .
&quot; emerging , it is not useful . &quot;
and in a bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ ent in all corners , and if it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ aries , must show itself first . &quot;
there is a lot of things that could make a row .
&quot; however , the SPD is still trying to gain internal security during the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled first time to be careful and says , &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to security . &quot;
still Volkswagen glimp@@ ses by .
&quot; despite diesel sk@@ and@@ als , the supplies are rising worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs around .
in the back @-@ back campaign there are vor@@ tex in order to get a term .
Volkswagen starts into the second half @-@ time with the supplies .
Europe &apos;s biggest high@@ ways can continue in the previous year despite the diesel @-@ aff@@ ection@@ ary due to its many brands and some well @-@ moving markets further a plus .
&quot; but in July , the core brand VW mainly weak@@ ened in Western Europe and it is once again able to sell the total sale as the companies involved in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the brand VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than at the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ her the supplies for almost a six@@ teenth .
&quot; brand tri@@ eb@@ sch@@ ef Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ est figures from July , especially on two sales stage less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it has given rise to a number of core markets with &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around Putin &apos;s coup in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um refused to be deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , where the car@@ bure@@ tors initially escal@@ ated , stands also further a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; overall , the mainly affected area of defe@@ atism of the Lower Saxony is any further glimp@@ sed by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , there is only a supplier of 0,@@ 9 per cent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
consolidated F@@ ef Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a selling spl@@ itting from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , around $ 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software qu@@ ests .
&quot; in Germany , VW about 2.5 million cars calls for change in the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the conversion , VW , that the re@@ building of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the retro@@ fit of the vehicles , there are no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power . &quot;
&quot; the high@@ ways point the customer after the change@@ over a &quot; Guarant@@ ee &quot; certificate , but I am not talking about a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was on Friday in business travel . &quot;
reason are legal enemies .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; had reported , Volkswagen p@@ onder@@ s its German customers now but a guarantee for diesel @-@ scale diesel models . &quot;
this last Monday VW @-@ representatives in the Federal Ministry of Defence had been confirmed last Monday .
&quot; from the transport of transport was confirmed , that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has made the resolution of my research Commission and the KBA in full . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of it are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after the conversion , no deteri@@ or@@ ations will take place unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not how it was in business travel .
&quot; in the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; , Volkswagen provides the possibility that customers come for example a half year after the conversion into a workshop - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is any other damage regarding any other damage , which does not have anything to do with the ab@@ normal sc@@ andal as it was meant . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW the term &quot; guarantee &quot; does not use . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from wealthy austerity - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; Josef Paul said Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher banks speaks of an individual case , and does not see a signal : normal austerity &quot; , &quot; are not afraid to pay for their austerity cru@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; bearing banks money on the night in the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0,@@ 4 percent criminal . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ or and cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs EUR 400 euros per year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time , he has been lifted 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day on the other , and that he could not be able to util@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; those lie with me on the bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I cannot put for any million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost he will continue after the urs@@ ement principle .
&quot; the cash is easy to let in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four over@@ s , I don &apos;t get the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the bank@@ note . &quot;
most customers would have had an understanding and of any kind of system forms .
only few emig@@ rated to other banks .
the cooperative Association of Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB will be a significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to wear only , be &quot; &quot; economic permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
with secution for deposits of 3 million euros the Thur@@ ingi@@ an Pop@@ ular and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their sk@@ il@@ bank branches 2014 head@@ lines .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Head of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is a climate that is equipped with the property . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , if they are free money . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 was founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has subsidiary in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , famous actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are no other banks known for the co @-@ oper@@ atives Association of Bavaria , who will calculate a p@@ ending attachment for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Federal Association of German Democratic banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ waren ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives , is very , very high . &quot;
competition is hard and it dro@@ us the emig@@ ration of jet@@ ties to the competition .
the customers in Germany will not be fallen in the width .
destination plates : who bu@@ ys sound plates ?
lonely men middle ages love plates .
&quot; before you go to the comm@@ ent@@ rope to over@@ so@@ wing it under the pseud@@ onym of Non@@ Al@@ le@@ ak@@ sam@@ en@@ men , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the promised re@@ fr@@ aming of sound plates do not want to welcome a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects but on mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently purchased one record are all pre@@ view@@ ings after the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely cheese group . &quot;
it is also not a hormone for hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older plate of flat reserve their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoying it alone time to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results agree with You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on television , I would follow the camera , while in the midst of a busy street in Soho , a hum@@ ble attack carry and wild@@ ly soci@@ alize , before I res@@ ist , my hands hold and a bit of saying , &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ hos expands slowly to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller located - there is still a handful of fantastic turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the camera to turn the camera to the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from S@@ ister Ray ( fil@@ tered ) : eight men middle ages , a woman , presum@@ ably about 20 ) succ@@ ession , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; this sound plates , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by him ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such a significant number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he did not afford them , when they had appeared , when he was young and bank@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; many things that I buy , are from the late six@@ ties , early 70@@ s , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , in which I was probably a bit of young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time , and adds : &quot; I smo@@ other not and I drink not much . &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray also believes that many customers , which he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; but he also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have promp@@ ted themselves to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I managed , people usually have been kidn@@ apped in 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records in order to buy CDs , sell their CDs now to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to followers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to see that record , a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people offers . &quot;
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record @-@ fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to retreat to the stability of familiar mu@@ til@@ ation , of objects , the bl@@ iss@@ ful Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of the material@@ istic pos@@ sessions than a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is me as a collector that I think it is with many people .
it is a simple way to be spirit@@ ually .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ ax a staff of a record @-@ stack .
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people , the last month have bought a record , they have not heard yet . &quot;
&quot; the survey was also found out that 41 % have a record player , which they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record . &quot;
&quot; at this time of news report I would probably look very concerned , while I had bor@@ dered by a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works in Sounds of the Universe ( dating speed : three men middle ages ) has a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone first came here recently and said , &quot; I have no turn@@ table , but I would like to buy a radi@@ ator record , so I can put it into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a great percentage , but it happens definitely . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ las@@ hing , less musi@@ kl@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who are getting slow . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor , has an evil audience when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women aged middle ages . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts New syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ be@@ pack@@ aged pop instead of experimental Jazz dr@@ ush out of the l@@ oud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks sunny , but brand psychological trau@@ mas are difficult to determine if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around a few minutes in business and looks at the variation of the sheets available for sale . &quot;
it makes more of a man@@ or@@ tal @-@ tone than a grand@@ pa .
&quot; they do not deserve much , so the collecting of plates is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from one computer or another way but the beauty of plates is ... it drives off with a ver@@ ted sig@@ h .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , from which is said that a new generation of disk @-@ lovers is supposed to have inspired : urban out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; as I give the ticket to m@@ ust@@ ers the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teenagers who are group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter contem@@ plate a cro@@ sl@@ ey turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a stair@@ well , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Bu@@ ckl@@ ey , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; turn@@ out . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could give some customers to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most common to lux@@ uries like plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my inquiries made that the results of You@@ go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record shops in Soho , the large number of female collectors and turn@@ tables that exist in reality , turn@@ tables and in Onlin@@ e@@ for@@ en exist . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning certainly not with the bum@@ ble@@ be@@ es through record stores of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they rag@@ ing a aw@@ k@@ ward , 30 @-@ year wrong moder@@ ator , that rag@@ ing over the shoulders has nothing to rag@@ ing . &quot;

French Court borro@@ wed an offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French dish has rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , doz@@ ens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , living in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; during a trial proceedings , this week ar@@ ouses the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be fu@@ elled to sell 72 pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical stores in which persons within the bearing goods , of cigar@@ ettes up to En@@ erg@@ y@@ beverages , sell , hair@@ dressing services or buy tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be broken down , because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and that a fire@@ - and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals are offered by the state supported association and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also saw that the provisional business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical stores , but sp@@ te that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely people feed the &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers have to offer .
&quot; one of the places , which was threatened by the overthrow of departure , was the jungle book kids &apos; cafe of the camp that is a non @-@ profit group and 200 meals a day , English and French schools , as well as advice on asylum causes for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closing &apos; for these children of a catastrophe would be , of which the most recent eight years are old . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed layers : in various federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the temples which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the Vit@@ ronic company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for instance , for example , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on the highway construction or to build bridges , with temporary templates , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary Bl@@ itzen for compliance with speed b@@ umps . &quot;
a long @-@ lasting building can however be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its accumul@@ ator stops at un@@ interrupted measurement run five days , the case data is encrypted via a mo@@ dem . &quot;
laser measurement technology can also collect all vehicles across multiple tracks at the same time .
&quot; variable speed b@@ umps as well as passage from time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly @-@ driven state , one can move the p@@ endant of the manufacturer with any car with a to@@ cl@@ ut@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that he is not easy to use , he is lo@@ wered in the company , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the Bl@@ itzer from Vand@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; also foreign authorities res@@ ist with the new technique : the youngest of France has posted 100 pieces , after an order of 150 copies last year . &quot;
UK takes silver silver in 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gold gets
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain in 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening for an ab@@ rupt halt on the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ acons stage . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji told a masterpiece in handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , Post @-@ line , line @-@ run and ro@@ wer force to gain gold - her first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ ist of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was promised by the not too bad Tro@@ st@@ preis of the silver medal - Great Britain on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the boom , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could fall back to them in the finals . &quot;
but independently of that Fi@@ ji had be@@ aten a 15 @-@ man team in order .
it could be a sol@@ ace for GB - but it &apos;s probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow has to hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef@@ trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England of Wim@@ bl@@ edon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost in Ryan of each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this cap will be w@@ aking , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji was wonderful and left the attacks GB@@ s from fun abor@@ ation .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell , and Co . , as if you run in driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au left in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of play@@ time , Jerry Tu@@ wai still added another attack from the right corner that he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly added the ball .
a h@@ itting t@@ ackle clearance by Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal but it has kept Fi@@ ji only .
in the seventh minute l@@ ete J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch @-@ down and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the resum@@ ption and there was still a minute play time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by another weak tactics of the GB team and rus@@ hed to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while in GB still da@@ ve . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for relations of the first half season , till Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for long in favour of the south @-@ isl@@ anders , whose fans sh@@ ep@@ ed , fl@@ ags , and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the p@@ fi@@ ff pastry , the fi@@ j@@ is h@@ ug@@ ged and GB k@@ ick@@ ed crus@@ hed into the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier in the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated Fi@@ ji Japan in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 , and Great Britain grew in South Africa in a bright semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match of the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference . &quot;
K@@ yle Brown brought the boats in the first half to the front but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate among the post in the second half .
&quot; a brilliant tac@@ tic of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , cau@@ tioned the profit - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ ine gold than with these games and that wants what hot .
&quot; from the first line up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , entering into the story , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it was only the Bei@@ den , which were at the ruin , there were three votes in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they rested on the Second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the two without tax wife , the first women in the history of British sport that made such a standard . &quot;
&quot; your domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her older un@@ packed commitment , which is likewise exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , which are about the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflected the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
behind every gold in Ru@@ ins is a batt@@ ali@@ on who contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that would constitute the difference and there was no man @-@ man than the coach who would not survive this day at all than it was diagnosed with him cancer .
&quot; as he said , he was risky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , the op@@ eri@@ ed and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do this , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty sham@@ eful situation .
there is a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he was starting at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could begin what the break kept to a minimum , in case that in such circumstances the right term is . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back better again . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is a challenge , but it makes it an even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the infin@@ ity of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning with a little more than anything else and thus tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was named as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in an action in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional Wr@@ ong . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated just how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive Thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I could not have wished for a better person for dre@@ aming or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with them .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started un@@ lock , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not get out of it .
&quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not out of doing something t@@ oll@@ es . &quot;
&quot; today we wanted no fire@@ works , we simply wanted to achieve a good result and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future will meet .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she is just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took around six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olymp@@ ics . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so tr@@ acked .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years of exempl@@ ary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association , &quot; &quot; R@@ up@@ pert Gö@@ ller , &quot; is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ al exempl@@ ary . &quot; &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago it called in the original state in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken did not succeed . &quot;
the work of the V@@ eit@@ y group &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ al &quot; &quot; as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , the 31 years in the former employee who was 28 years of managing director . &quot;
he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 years .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , Municip@@ ality Breit@@ brunn , supports approximately 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the municipalities Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Baun@@ ah . &quot;
for other towns and municipalities there are water @-@ supply contracts .
&quot; the current President , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Ombud@@ sman in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller 1985 as a Wasser@@ wart , and has been appointed as Managing Director of the kenn@@ el . &quot;
&quot; its tasks have been very diverse and they extended to work on office and maintenance activities , the budget@@ ary planning creation , the household planning creation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency rates on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events they called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property management in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the bat@@ ches of water pipes . &quot;
I have not given a lac@@ tation and I have always recorded innovations because water is di@@ spar@@ ed and drinking water the most important food .
&quot; in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o she praised the Gö@@ ll@@ ers , reliable and correct service of over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used himself with a lot of heart @-@ purpose for his water @-@ purpose , and he has been quite right for the water @-@ purpose association , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he served as a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ y group to nit@@ rate at the Aqu@@ arius of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken . &quot;
for this he has received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller by the turn praised aqu@@ e@@ ons Al@@ f@@ ons g@@ rie@@ bel , who worked for 28 years with him . &quot;
he is the best water of water and he was a faithful servant .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlights from his point of view , he describes the fountain pen and the re @-@ structured of the kenn@@ el . &quot;
the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the pipe @-@ breaking down at Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on 3 January .
&quot; at minus 17 degrees all night will work through , so that the villages were supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; the supplies of Neu@@ brunn was also only maintained , because one filled the flood of P@@ ett@@ stadt . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer out of Lau@@ ter who enters the succ@@ ession of Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .

&quot; the man has inv@@ oked by us and stated his life companion , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; the offen@@ ders should be on the flight , after him I will be publi@@ ci@@ zed openly . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be traveling by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters large , mus@@ cular , brown , and has a Gl@@ at@@ ze . &quot;
by now the police have released a photo of him .
it is however a couple of years old .

the police talks about a &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators of 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the responsible police in Lübeck did not want to make no information on the t@@ ather@@ ings or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man was killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a red@@ dish deli@@ ver@@ ance . &quot;

steel - light idea for German steel industry
the US @-@ isen@@ das exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains of extra costs in million@@ aires .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which are dro@@ ught by the sector from the eastern cost of electricity , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it ab@@ ide by release of the renewable energy system in the components for so @-@ called Self @-@ consumption in the German steel industry , said Bundes@@ minist@@ ries Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Fri@@ o @-@ over@@ s ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we were able to finally reach the negotiations for two years .
&quot; the European Commission was therefore planned initially planned to use the steel manufacturer , the gases from the ho@@ oves to generate electricity generation for their own consumption , in order to request . &quot;
&quot; the steel industry was added additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year , according to the German industry trade industry . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , I now give a fundamental certificate of the EU Commission for talks with competition Com@@ miss@@ ary Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only if the generators are replaced in the steel cables , a case of 20 percent in case of an E@@ EG @-@ level . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission to electricity supply .
this makes the status quo of the current regulation largely determined .
special meaning have the successful effort of Gabriel for steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; steel is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the reform of the emissions behaviour , climate and employment targets are to be seen , &quot; explained IG Metall chef Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe suff@@ ers from the financial crisis in 2008 under over@@ capacity and a significant price print .
&quot; last year , the situation continued to increase as the world @-@ largest producer of China in view of the weak@@ est domestic demand mass in the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel turn@@ able value dump@@ ing .
in the course of this early years the situation has a little relaxed .
&quot; to the one show in@@ breeding @-@ tariff on im@@ portable impact , on the other hand the economic views of China have picked up in China . &quot;
unclear is how sustainable the discounts is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained careful on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices could have been stag@@ nat@@ ing again . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp wanted to not close also the lock@@ ings of individual works .
around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel manufacturer remain careful despite rising prices and mounting orders . &quot;
they produced about 3.4 million tons of up to six percent less rough @-@ year than in the pre @-@ year @-@ year as the economic re@@ union of steel on Friday .
&quot; after a short increase in May , the crowd went back to the second month of succ@@ ession . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the production is expected by two percent under the previous year . &quot;
the Association counting in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with a rising output .
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing seniors good &quot;
&quot; the S@@ ingen has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as young girl she was in the school choir , in the office study , she occupied the barrel of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a sample they feel balanced , cheerful and overall lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they do something good for their health and their mind . &quot;
&quot; for S@@ ingen is the same from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , he says Erhard h@@ ers by the German senior Bundes@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most seniors singing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes Hac@@ kler . &quot;
through regular interaction you can establish senior social contacts and cultiv@@ ate .
&quot; for frequently , social and family structures lie at age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize themselves to others , and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of awareness . &quot;
&quot; singing may be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , suppose Hac@@ kler . &quot;
for they are practicing seniors a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who asks his lungs regularly , but also in everyday life not as fast as the har@@ dest . &quot;
&quot; even when it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; for older people , S@@ ingen is often a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz said of the German @-@ work community of the senior organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , explains her . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently observed that the singing or hearing of songs with older people we@@ ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
through Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially melo@@ dies themselves deny yourself deny people to long returned events .
&quot; in singing , the head is also demanded for a special power , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
focusing on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; especially older people who live alone , practice so that not just concentrate on themselves . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through the singing in the chor@@ us means Hac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem is growing through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I get too long for something , I become better and watch@@ ful about me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with the S@@ ingen , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means , little talent to have , betra@@ ying L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you are singing not alone - with 50 singing men , who h@@ ears there when a sound goes aside ? &quot;
&quot; looking for a suitable offer , seniors have different options , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sing someone from acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , one can simply join it . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views on cho@@ irs in the area .
&quot; who would like to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir , can turn directly to the church or the F@@ athers . &quot;
many seniors is also found via the Internet .
&quot; who does not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours may ask for help with the internet computer . &quot;
&quot; who desire to sing , should be connecting to a choir , tra@@ der Hac@@ kler . &quot;
sing the soul well and has something fre@@ eing - this applies to any age .
cats are sensitive as a cat on scre@@ ams of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover which effect the effect of Katz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , the r@@ ust even let the males were not cold - however , they stopped in contrast to the females always equal . &quot;
female cats can recognize the excitement of Katz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the Mi@@ row of the Small .
&quot; they respond to ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of kittens , who have found themselves in big need as scientists from the veterinary University and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; cr@@ ater also react on the ru@@ ms of kittens , but always the same . &quot;
&quot; evi@@ dently the acou@@ sti@@ cal differences between mi@@ tig@@ ate are less and strongly arous@@ ed vir@@ ons for the males either not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H . &quot;
it is first authorized in the study that was published on this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and the top @-@ level of the kittens with the ur@@ gency of their assistance has been distinguished . &quot;
observed in a total of nine adult women and eight females from the Ti@@ tian &apos;s MH@@ H .
they were played for a herd of little ones who were taken for three minutes from the litter box and were separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams by more strongly arous@@ ed kittens who were additionally raised up . &quot;
the researchers keep their findings despite the low sampling of sc@@ ap@@ ness .
&quot; all the females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted upon the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the l@@ oud@@ speaker when this pack played the very hard kittens .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ed or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , researchers have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men on c@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; also , some studies showed that women were sensitive to inf@@ ant to inf@@ ant whether they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist reported in Marina Sche@@ dule . &quot;
Pod@@ ol@@ ski is drawing up with &quot; g@@ ala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
Turkey has been en@@ acted in Turkey against the one @-@ sided football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ vers a arrest warran@@ t .
him shall be accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup , a key football game takes place in Turkey . &quot;
before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ bishop between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Pod@@ ol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup of Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
&quot; already in the suspension of the det@@ ain@@ ment after the crash trial in July , the government , the everyday life of standardization should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup . &quot;
it is not just before football .
against the previous Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ vers put the prosec@@ utor to a arrest warran@@ t .
&quot; according to this , the addi@@ ct was accused of being a member of a terrorist group in America . &quot;
addi@@ c@@ r should be p@@ endant of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup d &apos;@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup d .
&quot; although this is true for 90 days of exp@@ elled susp@@ ends until October , in fact that in the life of the most Turks , however , has no effect on the life of most Turks . &quot;
the &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; of public places in the whole country has explained Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for termin@@ ated . &quot;
the sport is - as the whole country - split in followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as traditionally are not among the friends of the President .
&quot; but what the gross of the Turks , but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans are even united - regardless of whether their heart beats up for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; g@@ ala &quot; it will be especially coming to Luke Pod@@ ol@@ ski .
his sporting value presented the Cologne season in the past season : with 17 gates and nine deposits in all competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first playing time as an Top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 to seal .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; &quot; rejoice : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he has completed the season in an excellent way and secured the Cup team .
&quot; thanks &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; found the disappointing season for the record master a irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot;
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ I.@@ in the Champions League the &quot; lions &quot; also distinguished in the Europa League early .
in the sweet@@ per li@@ g it was only rank six .
the season was not good .
the Po@@ kal was the only way to win something .
&quot; we have managed and this is the most important , &quot; said Pod@@ ol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as the game was better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who , with 26 seasons , as an Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ri@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig , laid the base on the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that fans will continue to return to the return of 31 year @-@ old .
&quot; at the AC Florence under the treaty , he was not only the borro@@ wed Gom@@ ez under the treaty and announced at B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as only to return to the coup , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario still wants to come to us , he must only say &quot; zi@@ pped the journal &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ chef Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the storms would have to be ready to reno@@ unce around one third of his to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man asked clear : &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence can we not pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin has already been locked twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics sinn@@ ers can only laugh it - they fight in Rio to medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing determines how before the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian child @-@ law in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , which had turned off after a dop@@ ing lock its start right shortly before the games , was mer@@ ged in their start ( 100 metres of chest ) gn@@ ust@@ los and mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; there was a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scene : with a set @-@ up smile , she was still in the hall and had prov@@ oked with her appearance . &quot;
&quot; as a firm , that they will not pick up gold , the audience broke into a jubil@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other athletes , who go to the Olympic Games in Rio at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics . &quot;
he had been locked for two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered as the biggest issue of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ two Olymp@@ ics in 2010 had to sit in 2010 after taking the pain of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery I had severe pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 has been tested the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ er of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster@@ in from 2010 to 2016 positively on the wast@@ ed stimul@@ ant means meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ kovic swe@@ eps the kno@@ ck@@ le intake and was locked six months locked .
the four wid@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger and two @-@ picturesque World Champion over 400 m , 2010 was positively tested and 21 months been locked . &quot;
an instrument for penis enlargement may have been responsible for praying mer@@ ging .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world .
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly an ath@@ l@@ ete , so many medals were noted . &quot;
&quot; so , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having been established testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the meantime 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; which also recognized Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the Olympic Games in 2008 , he received due to a document of the International Sports Tribunal . &quot;
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is located on the rank two of the world list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : world premiere and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested only in May , but must nevertheless start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; during the 29 year old World Championship , references to the intake of a prescription supplement were found , the sper@@ re of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing @-@ agency W@@ ada fell mild and ran already on 13 July . &quot;
Bom@@ ben@@ thos in Thailand - Austri@@ ans in@@ ju@@ red - Multi@@ ere T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Finance , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ soon . &quot;
&quot; she suffered schn@@ apps suffered , and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left it again . &quot;
your visit@@ or@@ ship have planned it planned for early September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the tourists island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ ani Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on also have the Austrian citizen . &quot;
&quot; the State Department has been in constant contact with local authorities , so sn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at around 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hua H@@ in was initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a footh@@ ills of two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; the police have been killed a Tha@@ il@@ change in and about 20 people , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning again two jumps , so according to the authorities a further man was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bom@@ bs .
near the Det@@ on@@ ation near the popular beach Bad@@ estr@@ ands Pat@@ ong was in@@ ju@@ red to police statements and a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country , then a further bom@@ b which killed a city council . &quot;
the spr@@ inkl@@ ing was according to the authorities in a flower show before the Re@@ four of the coastal police force in the air .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations demanded det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the southeast coast several wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; one connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , was called it . &quot;
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ ch@@ att@@ ates carry the same manus@@ cript , &quot; said Ar@@ eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ early prior to journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
it is too early to express themselves to possible motiv@@ ations - probably it is however about the works of Muslim rebels .
&quot; Thai media also wanted a pattern on the attacks , which is typical for bom@@ bing that Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Thai police explained the attacks in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or by international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
it is much of the fact that the bom@@ bs were laid by opponents of the ruling military j@@ unt@@ a .
&quot; in the last days of intelligence , the authorities would have received secrecy in the south of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed of the exact time and the places . &quot;
still be unclear which group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police officers in the whole country to increase security around important government buildings and airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement parks . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ bing ra@@ inf@@ all , but they usually do not turn against tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hua H@@ in is a palace , which was used for years of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
&quot; after the hear@@ ings of bom@@ b explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry , recommends a consequence of his home page , the instructions of the Thai Security Auth@@ orities . &quot;
&quot; high safety risks ( security level 3 ) , for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security guards and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel into these provinces before . &quot;
higher security risks for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday made a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military j@@ unt@@ a Constitution .
this spatial value of the military influence even in the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the Bom@@ bs were an attempt to sti@@ ce chaos , while the land is moving towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military unt@@ a , who had taken power in 2014 after a period of bloody crimes , holds itself good to have the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the control over the years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
in the conflict there were already more than 6@@ 500 people killed .
almost a year ago in Bangkok the attack were killed in a popular Hin@@ du Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; has got into the spot@@ light of the Bundes@@ am@@ as for constitutional protection .
&quot; after several lands , the Constitutional Treaty also put the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; cl@@ ue for aspirations against the freedom @-@ democratic basic order , &quot; said A@@ wak@@ ening Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , the cry of other Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist manner . &quot;
that is why we are watching the movement well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Constitutional Treaty in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - watch the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely aligned with the landlord &apos;s decision . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &quot; identity movement &quot; try to pick their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Treaty . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking extre@@ mi@@ sts , addressing them with y@@ outh@@ ful language , often with p@@ opp@@ iger music . &quot;
these are Islam@@ ists as well as the law of extreme extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an adverti@@ ser advertising for your own cause .
the propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are especially sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , from several federal states had given reports of contacts of &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , I have no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this sort only be relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist , their target path is changing and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
decisive factors is whether such individuals have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the marked increase of right@@ ful crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and Refu@@ ge@@ es , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
yet we have noticed in recent years that there can be right@@ ed frag@@ ment structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fri@@ ction group .
&quot; it can be quite well that further legitimate group@@ ings or small groups formed , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
a nation@@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of rect@@ ster@@ s@@ ism is not recognizable .
the former groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; nevertheless , Ma@@ ate pointed out that many super@@ gri@@ ps went to the account of people that did not appear before in the right scene . &quot;
this is the worrying .
&quot; many of the crime against attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes committed before the extreme @-@ extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have chosen CD@@ U , SPD or left wing themselves , however , which have been radi@@ cal@@ ised by right wing extremis@@ m . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ oni@@ on or world head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center fluctu@@ ate the slightly overweight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia so slow , that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures . &quot;
it disappeared and easy - no matter how far the detail was selected .
in the social networks Hab@@ te was subsequently presented to the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a retri@@ eve of 48 seconds and ranked the 5@@ 9th place of 59 Star@@ tern . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still takes part in the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians has got a special start@@ led by the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ presented countries of known .
&quot; because in e@@ dic@@ s most sports@@ men run , it just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
fast the first sur@@ names were the round .
some media signed it as &quot; RO@@ BEL of the whale . &quot;
&quot; in evidence of a &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; the English bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ blatt &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; was fun with &quot; D@@ ad b@@ od &quot; about him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter of free style , it didn &apos;t play a role . &quot;
compare with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
in the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i had been paid for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool of Equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to compete more than 100 metres of free style .
Frank@@ ene@@ tically was fired at the time M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
at that time 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned first eight months before Olymp@@ ics and had never taken a long distance in front of competition .

G@@ FR@@ P leadership comes after dis@@ closing business
the conversation @-@ research company Gf@@ K de@@ du@@ es his head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the return cuts were suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K did not susp@@ ect that the chair of Vor@@ stand@@ sch@@ ef Matthias Hart@@ mann would be so safer , the longer the successes of the promised successes . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of Nuremberg &apos;s market research company Gf@@ K : after once again dis@@ continuing business pay and the resign@@ ation of the company &apos;s leadership is the worldwide number five in the industry ahead of a human cat@@ cher .

Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K peak since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of the restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business , each participant will become un@@ steady . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case in the case of BMW , this would also be the qu@@ and@@ ts . &quot;
the company had not able to stop its evac@@ uation by attacks in the preceding quarters in the second quarter of 2016 .
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales increased by 6.@@ 1 per cent below the level of the compar@@ ative pre @-@ year figure . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the first half @-@ year , sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros have been raised by 3.4 per cent . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter , above all , the value of the company was deb@@ ited above all in the light of its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; in the business division of Consumer Experience , the company &apos;s sales department is necessary to deliver € 139 million euros by the Group , which gives a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million . &quot;

accidents - Bus slides in Kru@@ mm@@ ation in Gr@@ aben : eight Ver@@ last
&quot; in an accident of a travel bus with 43 seniors as a driver for passengers , on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ ences ( district , Aur@@ i ) had been in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , shared the police with . &quot;
&quot; the 66 years old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to their specifications , according to an antagon@@ ist l@@ aster , the partly was on the cable car . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a speaker of the police Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; because of the situation of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire@@ bri@@ g@@ ade un@@ fre@@ ed the in@@ mates .
six life@@ jack@@ cars and a not@@ ches arrived at the in@@ genu@@ ity on the national road 2 .
the most recent travel@@ er were brought back by a regular bus bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ ences part of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load @-@ experienced and possible witnesses to sign up with the police .
&quot; the fees per Ku@@ bi@@ km@@ eter wast@@ ew@@ ater will be starting from 1 October 2016 for the area of wast@@ ew@@ ater We@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of up to 43 Euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the water fee will be at least once again increase if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a ris@@ er calculation , the water price in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4,@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; like Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the budget by the landsc@@ ap@@ ed Kul@@ mb@@ ach was noted that for these wast@@ ew@@ ater sub @-@ systems under@@ mines . &quot;
the Kas@@ endorf market is committed to its legal basis due to the legal basis of operating systems .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ es , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg must take deeper into the po@@ cket@@ book . &quot;
the increase increases between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed the body was a novel@@ ty of charges necessary for the wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment of the market . &quot;
&quot; during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , there are also over@@ - or under@@ cuts from the previous cal@@ cul@@ ation period . &quot;
&quot; the engra@@ ving mix@@ tures was founded through all three se@@ wage systems around relatively small facilities , with a very low wast@@ ew@@ ater , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the small distribution of distribution for example , they would have a expenses for the repairs of several thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ ew@@ ater in all three systems be easily declined . &quot;
&quot; in the return of all three systems , not least because of their age of age , they are not least because of their age , san@@ itation and repair expenditure in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the complex in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt rejected that in the water system Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to any damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ ain , the first twenty @-@ year old promot@@ ers had to be over@@ hau@@ led and used at the pond system Lop@@ p had to be installed after nearly 20 years of operation of the first cler@@ k , the Kl@@ är@@ schl@@ amm , and to be able to keep an additional ins@@ ing option to keep the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued super@@ vis@@ ing and maintenance costs have been taken into account according to the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 are still significantly below the present level .
&quot; stone houses made clear that at low break@@ water fall in the three systems the expenses for the operation and maintenance , &quot;
&quot; in this process , added Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment have stopped over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to be pre@@ ached in the duration of stone houses on the long run , since one cannot bro@@ aden the supply of the water @-@ purpose of Fries@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal for these plants , because it concerns the deficit . &quot;
Bulgaria over the first time in 8 months Inflation
&quot; national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria started in July 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) , and the first over zero since October last year , as a positive 0,@@ 2 % . &quot;
the annual average rate of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer fee in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1,0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was 0.3 % and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was 0.6 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods are observed in July 2016 : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1,@@ 7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 4.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices were falling in clothing and shoes ( 2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , appliances , and rout@@ in@@ ew@@ ings ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in the pre @-@ month at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education is unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian caric@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ me inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ elling towards breeds . &quot;
&quot; using its filter tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure out of a Roy Lich@@ tenstein Pain@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are ou@@ trag@@ eous , trans@@ duc@@ tive tools that generate more than 30 million improved selection per day . &quot;
all the mis@@ steps are to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past that they were accused of that the app will be black@@ face or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week proposed a filter a filter that gave them mud , false teeth and open che@@ eks , there were some critics a racial caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; beloved &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether this repeti@@ tive checks on a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the rebellion were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat that it had been disabled . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was meant as a hom@@ age to Ani@@ me characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , the r@@ attle experiences have experienced , in@@ sured the filter at vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ me comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art @-@ student , whose T@@ we@@ et has been widely used over the photos that the filter &apos; hur@@ ting and k@@ ill@@ ings were told unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very contradic@@ tory Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ lo@@ wed , but that the money was drawn into the off @-@ value extremis@@ m . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ b .
&quot; the American culture seems to be ent@@ angl@@ ed into an endless diver@@ gence and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are in the race of race as their older counter@@ players - could rather be expected to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tering a picture creates that such things happened is much more difficult , that such things was un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to work as a product management and engineer for medium to delete their Snap@@ chat account for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an attachment for medium and in a phone interview , she said that they believe that racial @-@ specific controls have a shortage of diversity in the settings activ@@ ating at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u cri@@ tici@@ zed the big part of white , only male leaders and ended up their attachment with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no other representation of people with other colored colors in their staff , so they can meet such decisions , &quot; said the chin@@ ese American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other colored colors that are working there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat is largely un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; the company does not publish any figures to the diversity of its workforce , and indicates its status as a private company . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat handed down to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently focused on a human responsible person who focuses on under@@ lined population groups and in internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said that she is closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder whether they need more users like us to say that this is not o.@@ k@@ . &quot;
&quot; military guidance , ISIS &apos; secret information , determines the committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; the members of the United States Central Command changed news , in order to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it had allowed the actual state &apos;s affairs committee in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provisional report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the dispute committee and the Wehr@@ budget kom@@ mit@@ es , reported of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Services , which reported how inci@@ dents changed its ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , briefly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; News information , which have been ma@@ iled by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ uren typically issued a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual states on site , and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what is to happen at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering , when poor analyses are presented our political leaders , &quot; s Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ cans member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the manag@@ erial error in Cent@@ Com are up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ pages report presents detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi Arm@@ ed Forces .
&quot; though there is no direct evidence that government tips given below Obama instructions given to change the reports , it shows how an@@ al@@ ysts saw the pressure of their superi@@ ors , an optimal image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS , or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half @-@ year 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , statements and statements about the Congress were significantly more positive than it presented to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com eth@@ os was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ m could already start in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can congresses from K@@ ansas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the peaks of the Central Command has changed the news reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Republi@@ can ri@@ ef@@ en the Task Force in Life , after them was played , the an@@ al@@ ysts were worried about the mani@@ p@@ ulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during investigations .
further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports are in progress by the General Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published on Thursday their own findings that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com has created a fully restricted process for the creation of news of IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , a member of the Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Ship , in an opinion known . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Ship , &quot; &quot; bog@@ ged the publication of news reports , &quot; &quot; ash@@ amed the mor@@ ality among an@@ al@@ ysts and &quot; &quot; provided little space for so@@ othing opinions . &quot;
&quot; however , Mr. Ship and Democr@@ at gave no evidence to have found evidence on an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st concerning a &quot; &quot; political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; .
&quot; in August last August , the New York Times reported by the General Secretary General of the Pentagon , which were recorded according to complaints from Cent@@ Com an@@ al@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on reports of Congress , while the investigation of the general contractor would still be underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ ting opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a contro@@ versy discussion of these important topics of national defence . &quot;
&quot; the investigations have no effect on the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion , which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have however raised the question to how President Obama can rely on Central Command for ehr@@ able ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the secret information on the Islamic State remind more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the dam@@ aging government knew only a small occupation force in Iraq and little time on it , about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in the u@@ prising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led to Mr. Hoo@@ ker after the statement of government agencies set out that contrary to the statements made by the Islamic State or not had any significant impact on the financial situation of the terr@@ ors , since this pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical sophistic@@ ation would have taken into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commands , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III was critic@@ ised by members of the leg@@ is@@ diction of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the U.S. winning fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field@@ ho@@ ckey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans have won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , they could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea , &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not among the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; but that knows them : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place that after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two within their group will take the first and second place within their group . &quot;
the first @-@ plat@@ ter will take a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising pul@@ ling of their success story , four years after they landed over the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years in the hands of the hockey club in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; it missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since they could not qualify for the K@@ ader . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went everything wrong .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ anders , coach of the National Team , and this began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a culture change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the working order in London that we now have .
we have completely pl@@ uck the ruin .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the p@@ inn@@ s in the first half of the game with a back@@ stroke from the se@@ am area .
&quot; India was gone without a victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed herself surprisingly strong and held the game board from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until the game took into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she carried out a spr@@ int with the flat ball on the left side , then moved to the middle and left the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 leadership . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the gam@@ eke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will hin@@ ge from the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the v@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are consistent and in@@ es@@ capable of , a dynamic stag@@ gering between competition and pursuit . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the oly@@ mp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning st@@ ab , who is for swimm@@ ers from the bracel@@ et to the swimm@@ ers to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you can not turn the TV to read a newspaper or listen to a conversation at the queue in the Coff@@ ee@@ hop , without over Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ co@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is here for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could quite well be sent among these known names , which were sent to Prime Time , built through sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he would be a swimm@@ ers , Tur@@ ner or even F@@ ail@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the oly@@ mp@@ ic tramp@@ oline to gold . &quot;
the oly@@ mp@@ ic flame does not illuminated any event immediately .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized : air spray guns , Arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always swim the chest and may not reign it for a long time .
&quot; but if I was hum@@ ble arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ox has already been an oly@@ mp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it was in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so pointed out that many that , I did not know that there is an Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent Ath@@ l@@ ished for competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ox , and had made an ath@@ l@@ ete until 2012 until the end of 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ox has a certain external body , partly because it was for the un@@ enlight@@ ened ear @-@ fit for a Clo@@ wn@@ s@@ schule as the ones for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a sublime enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous tre@@ m@@ bling of his never to end g@@ pr@@ one - but also the Grazie of the gymn@@ as@@ tics and num@@ b , the two sports that combines it essentially . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means as much means &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winner jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ ears and sal@@ cars ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olymp@@ ics according to execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ day athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other . &quot;
the common oly@@ mp@@ ic V@@ ektor is straight .
&quot; medalli@@ sts must go on in their quest for gold , faster , upward and above , sometimes to finish , sometimes down and back , upwards and down on the playground . &quot;
they do not chase the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the raw wall but in the television transmission also another ca@@ vities : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ad ords .
&quot; the target @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bles , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even sti@@ r a audience to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I am interested in looking at this games as something fatigue .
&quot; of course , the tramp@@ oline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a for@@ wards movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t , apparently weight@@ el@@ os like an astr@@ on@@ aut , continues upwards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; also here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the target , not a wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant removal of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games only .
&quot; the qualification and final ceremony of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in stre@@ aming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will shine in the end as part of an afternoon blo@@ c on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that will probably over@@ look in the general tumor . &quot;
&quot; if the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and the object of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his to air rin@@ ce , new fan . &quot;

violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators and the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance to the government .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esting during the cl@@ ashes with the police have been killed by the police force .
is Ethiopia just bringing together ?
&quot; over the last ten years , it was one of the most stabili@@ zed countries of Africa , a solid ban@@ ker of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
but in the last few months the protest against the government broke up the country and spread more and more areas .
last week thousands of people ple@@ aded on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen clim@@ bed on zig un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; in the course @-@ run videos about protests supported by the last or beginning of this year , such as security people show young people with poles , while these were forced to make a hand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN authority for Human Rights is now calling for an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country , and in future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians , to combat the terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa if at all , so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expands in a resp@@ ectable pace .
his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new p@@ enser in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have constantly led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby dis@@ pres@@ idents were effectively brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness . &quot;
but this could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options apart from prot@@ ested , it breaks off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in Central . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground @-@ use to the wor@@ sen@@ ing in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a broad critic@@ ised choice last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions along the border to Eritre@@ a ; a struggle for this delicate , controversial line requested in June hundreds of life . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts , such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less imposed in recent years , the turbul@@ ence have grown more or less . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of dro@@ pping rose under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media because cheap smartphones are becoming more frequent and improved the internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government susp@@ ends access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does in regular intervals , especially with Prot@@ ests , many people can still communicate via internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they spend . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave that they were gathered so to protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mainly to Christian emig@@ ration , in politics and the economy , while they are the Oro@@ mos @-@ exploited , of which many Muslims have been living and in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the main protests found in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which are about 6 percent of the population , and those in the military , are dominant in the intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebellion , was up to his death in a not publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about the corners . &quot;
&quot; an@@ al@@ ysts say that he was particularly se@@ ated to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special officers , to edit opponents and make them harmful . &quot;
&quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen by relatively in@@ scr@@ utable reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Finland , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood shed .
&quot; the last time , Ethiopia has experienced such a mo@@ il before 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , according to the statements of an@@ al@@ ysts , were seemingly fu@@ eled by the government and then stolen away . &quot;
&quot; during the following raid , many prot@@ otypes were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts pra@@ ising the leader for their vision@@ ary infrastructure , such as the new P@@ end@@ der Standard , as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty . &quot;
&quot; but obviously , this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ fortun@@ es of the Ethiop@@ ian government . &quot;
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; the last month of the protests in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ischen city , of Tig@@ ray @-@ guided shops and the hat@@ red towards the Tig@@ ray will always be exercis@@ able in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that protests in the US and other Western allies put into a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though they recently agreed that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want to collap@@ sed its association in an already vol@@ ati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim Obama ISIS be &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp attempted to disp@@ er@@ se on Friday the last contro@@ versy , which surrounds his campaign so that his several repeated asser@@ tive claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; &quot; founder &quot; &quot; of the terror State , not serious . &quot;
this clar@@ inet thre@@ w new questions about the communication skills of the presidential data of the Republi@@ cans if he is able to communicate clear and understandable with the American public .
&quot; it also brings its ro@@ bes , who strive to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protecting , to explain the actual position , which he could not meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having made the clear@@ ing at a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp were back on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intended to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early t@@ we@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tru@@ mp , he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was opposed to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator H@@ ugh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp , wanted to weak@@ en the statement that Mr Obama wants to destroy it , the Republi@@ can presidential guard did not want to know anything about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ selt to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he attempts to direct the focus of his campaign because of random re@@ vocation to the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject .
&quot; on Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought the sar@@ cas@@ m in its defence .
&quot; at the end of July he moved a strong criticism of himself , when he said the Russians were Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons of emails , but he said later &quot; &quot; Nat@@ al I said the s@@ ark@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then move back to your needs .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages from his fans will be taken , and then if necessary &quot; &quot; frame &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , which ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of depri@@ ved the tone of the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has accepted an even estimated sound , since its re@@ frac@@ tional values have gone back . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a guided tour with big advantage in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in head @-@ race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he accused his critics frequently asked his statements or to understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is increasingly focusing on attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ stre@@ ites into the un@@ comfortable situation regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative may also be his statements . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s celeb@@ rities , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked for the accuracy of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her amb@@ assador , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstre@@ am Republi@@ can attempt to argue that the government under Obama , served in Mrs. Clinton as an Foreign Minister , it adm@@ its to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them before him on each of his words and be taken toward him . &quot;
&quot; he betra@@ yed the &quot; poor , j@@ am@@ ic &quot; television professionals who try to understand him and said , &quot; You Can &apos;t know it ! &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats pointed out Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s exc@@ els than just another proof that he may be in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
once ur@@ ging the price of the market is Café in Green@@ point back
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a scru@@ oured café in Williamsburg , where you could only pay cash , that no Wi @-@ Fi had , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , due to the prices from his Bedford Avenue of the front . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , replaced the basket in summer 2014 , sold soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people ro@@ wn it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fication city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ians wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still do not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and now is a soap @-@ business now . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is , then it is also new finding . &quot;
a re @-@ loaded Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began to work with ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; as he offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ source , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot of things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ summer model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verse .
&quot; Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wich@@ es with bac@@ on and che@@ eses and there are Gar@@ ni@@ ers such as Cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there is natural departure bow@@ ls .
&quot; the café serves no beer more , there are fresh juices . &quot;
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pus@@ hes by awards from Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , dwelt in Williamsburg and visited the basket regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after it was moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path to himself . &quot;
&quot; after the exp@@ ir@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee cheese , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the ver@@ b , which fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they have ordered a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai tea , which is another new supplement . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long time standing by Tom Ros@@ enthal since the beginning of the year 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered inev@@ itably the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Foto Rodri@@ guez said , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he does not have a war@@ ll about it that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the col@@ d@@ ded coffee of coffee as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have accepted the café too . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated into the uphol@@ stery and Rodri@@ guez , that he has prepared to make them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has further advantages .
a local S@@ aft@@ ety I would like to fill the k@@ alt@@ ed coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the cafe is expan@@ sion@@ ed on a nearby building .
for many customers a new verse is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tri@@ bal and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; as the new café opened , Wh@@ ile said that the beg@@ ging of the local and the bri@@ ghten a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;

&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with silent people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ an .

&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when she met with a re@@ por@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em Im@@ bis@@ s in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ O crash in 1929 . &quot;

&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women bo@@ died for male field workers and it became fresh@@ ly baked pastry , for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; the Americans were the Americans , during the first World War food to star@@ ving Europeans . &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; marks the paths that the country went with it , no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ ming of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans a central , tense issue was &quot; , &quot; established co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense was the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ es : mysterious foods such as bread and cas@@ ser@@ ollen were re @-@ dying , the cas@@ ser@@ olle as &quot; wonderful type , eating remains re @-@ locking &quot; , &quot; mer@@ ged Zi@@ egel@@ man , because coo@@ ks un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients were hidden under a Cre@@ tan Sau@@ ce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap drying .
&quot; meat , which was for years at the heart of the American cuisine , has become a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculi@@ ar bl@@ ings have been tried , since a cal@@ orie and nour@@ ish satisfaction had to prevail over taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which includes also recipes , prepared Zi@@ egel@@ man a court from that epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ el butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;

&quot; while he has publicly proclaimed the simple Io@@ wa farm@@ houses in his kitchen , it &apos;s like the millions of millions of ordinary man of the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ urs continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room , and contributed a smo@@ king . &quot;
he was amaz@@ ingly realistic .
&quot; President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt perhaps have committed the same error if not his wife , Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the critics of a house@@ ke@@ eper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought forth the boring food in Washington but also one of the most obvious . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food , was rejected , once the land came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and nutrition , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science at food was applied . &quot;
the pair gave to the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded : &quot; &quot; she made people really sick . &quot;
there was the wind blo@@ wing .
&quot; after the T@@ eller were de@@ vac@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e a dessert that they had cooked at home : the Pfl@@ au@@ men@@ ue , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a m@@ outh@@ ful trick . &quot;
&quot; there was no conf@@ isc@@ ated cream , just p@@ eg@@ s , some fl@@ our , sugar , water and c@@ inn@@ amon . &quot;
&quot; everyone was de@@ plor@@ able a spo@@ on in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;

he set his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ed everything to save others life .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old itself has died on a fa@@ bom@@ bs attack by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , which was saved according to the picture @-@ newspaper almost 6@@ 0,000 people &apos;s life . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers are putting their own life on the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses , and to help in the area of war . &quot;
these are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civili@@ zations , that shows him with a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a inf@@ ants from the ruins of a house , went in 2014 to the world . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans to illumin@@ ate symbol@@ ism in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; however , as a hero he has never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I am dying , save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar himself had a attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b attack in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ opter have raised four fac@@ bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as . &quot;

Grön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest cycl@@ tier is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land usually arrive only in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation aboard the S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with well a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie will only get up with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; til@@ ted the Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it comes in an average of 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five meters long shot at s@@ atte 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is with this maximum speed half as fast as a ro@@ be . &quot;
&quot; this of long @-@ standing lifesty@@ les , however , seems to be a silver bul@@ let for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least Grön@@ land@@ hai , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ ecken from the Max @-@ Plan@@ ck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock these life @-@ span that means for ver@@ teb@@ rates a world record . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist had long been that Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie stein@@ alt will become old . &quot;
only missing the evidence .
&quot; Grön@@ land @-@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice @-@ caves in front of the sk@@ inny co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they dive at the surface mostly only in winter . &quot;
about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie researchers know researchers accordingly .
their tim@@ est@@ emp@@ o ma@@ ize it when they were up to S@@ val@@ bard six animals with a transm@@ itter .
&quot; loo@@ t make this shar@@ k anyway : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a ro@@ be , another had sw@@ allowed the p@@ ines of a young ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ s . &quot;
possibly hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rolling at the bottom of the ic@@ me@@ eres and look c@@ asses which are of higher water @-@ layers after bottom @-@ sw@@ ings .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as an example from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long , during the largest 5@@ 02 cen@@ timeters . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed it with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens of the shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ et is already created before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which included in it may no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks was striking a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 19@@ 50s , as an atomic weapon @-@ weapon larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon sti@@ ckers into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; with 220 cen@@ timeters in length , the left @-@ sized animal contained the lens with a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie had in its lens , on the other hand normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timet@@ res long Greenland at the age of 335 , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 cen@@ timeters even might be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
that Grön@@ land @-@ females only then got up if they are longer than four meters was known .
&quot; now , the researchers were able to assign the length of an old age . &quot;
&quot; as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ timeters probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years , Grön@@ land with the multip@@ lication is obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
also this might be the world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; even the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland Greenland , in whose bac@@ on at N@@ acken a 120 year old har@@ p tip , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures often the organism of the living animals live on as@@ ble , too . &quot;
so they are then later - and age slower .
&quot; to keep the cold water warm , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , through which the animal heating system . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram is therefore much larger than at one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should concentrate on having as many des@@ cen@@ dents as early as possible , &quot; &quot; explains the theory of evolution . &quot;
it was a very big animal in contrast its resources to invest more in a long life .

&quot; after the property , par@@ cel@@ esti@@ al and final questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for measurement could be questioned , the sale of plots in the residential areas of the road &quot; &quot; Road &quot; &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ strasse - Un@@ age section 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way . &quot;

&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , united the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision on the largest banks of the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities like the European insurance coverage of EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the database is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Luxembourg should maintain a great fund branch , s@@ ut@@ ures as well as Dublin even in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is clearly easier to reach from Frankfurt thanks to the large airport .
further points the city with easy available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Seine , the rental rate for first @-@ class wareh@@ ouses are 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is located on position seven , Luxembourg to place 19 , Dublin on position 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7. place . &quot;
&quot; if the quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could cause further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; ref@@ uses the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but London will remain in spite of Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , the most important financial centre in Europe , I mean the economic for@@ cements . &quot;
&quot; for this , the forces of power relations : in London worked according to numbers of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C Pat@@ ent@@ str@@ ated with Mer@@ ck
a US counter@@ party decided that Gilead Sciences Inc would be entitled to the refund of the legal costs which have emerged from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead , Gilead was fre@@ ed at the amount of $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were linked to the block@@ bu@@ ster medications S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ on@@ i of Gilead , including a US judge a pattern of mis@@ behavior of Mer@@ cks , including the opinion of injury and other un@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; upon arrival of the law@@ suit on Thursday , US Chancellor of Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , that Gilead means to be at the expense of the costs that have emerged during the defence of the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alize Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver illness . &quot;
&quot; the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead , and Mer@@ ck took each other def@@ endants and property to work on laboratory work that Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;

Cl@@ int@@ ons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % Bundes@@ control
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton published on Friday its tax return for 2015 , this y@@ iel@@ ded a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax exemp@@ tion from 34,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Cl@@ int@@ ons USD 1 million for charitable purposes mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton than@@ ked almost USD 5,@@ 3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aries ; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million by the publishing house Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for their book on their term in ministry . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ int@@ ons candidate for Vice President , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax statements made by the last ten years . &quot;
paid an effective Bundes@@ tax of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; gave Cl@@ int@@ ons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a cr@@ bound by contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hidden behind false expres@@ sions and instruc@@ tors in relation to his previous promises to publish its tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential data to publish their tax statements , even though they are not oblig@@ ated by law because of this . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New Yorker &apos;s busin@@ es@@ sman , and his lawyers have stated as a reason to denial a tax review by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Cl@@ int@@ ons elect@@ or@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in terms of publication of the presidential guard of Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special advisor , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax insp@@ ections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Cri@@ tics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential department of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already heard that his ref@@ us@@ al issues relating to assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business offices and various other connections , in particular with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton had already published on the subject and published on Friday a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ level Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp and call on its tax return . &quot;
on Thursday she spoke the topic even during a speech to the economy of Michigan .
&quot; he refused to do what any other presidential did@@ at has done in recent decades and to publish their tax statements . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has no or only very little taxes for two years , and an economic journalist of the New York Times zi@@ aded on Friday a series of tax @-@ attor@@ neys and tax consultants , the information that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal control has become an issue in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton support a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ et , which would make sure people pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama supports the proposal too .
&quot; during a election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ et , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ glomer@@ ate here has its headquarters to exchange Tru@@ mp at a meeting in order to exchange their tax statements . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ et said , he was also subjected to a tax review of IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp &quot; fear &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Cl@@ int@@ on campaign did not return tax return to 2007 .
&quot; the Cl@@ int@@ ons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40.@@ 5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the Cl@@ int@@ ons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of its income is referred to as wage , unlike most of the Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main financial investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Cl@@ int@@ ons divi@@ den@@ ds and y@@ ields of USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 con@@ fes@@ ted . &quot;

Jewish Director defe@@ ats Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after an &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media competition , after having betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pre @-@ election because the Arab guests had requested according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; led his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by providing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann Israel sought to find on the site list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel would be eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol provides a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
after an explanation the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; &quot; saw him &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel provided that the measure is a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason that behind it was extingu@@ ishing in the director , even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they have requested that the pre @-@ election was deleted , was the representative of Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli amb@@ assador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ trading sman called this a &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were ent@@ angl@@ ed and over@@ thrown by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
&quot; the fact that this in Germany has brought into exactly this hotel chain , is even an even greater shame . &quot;
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
&quot; the incident list a fairly large reson@@ ance in the internet , where people saw the whole a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; some under@@ stated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged to Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; ash@@ amed of you , called it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the no@@ ok Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all the alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident , &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , tells The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel would not take in the quick op@@ ort@@ list , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a speaker of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
it adds that the national selection now has been added .

&quot; students on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , together with the police , when they gathered themselves to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system . &quot;
the police put lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as and rubber @-@ fin against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as a police officers tried to explore the students , which led the police rubber @-@ fin and lac@@ kl@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students participated in demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Govern@@ ments of the federal state Sao Paulo Al@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a bit less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students will be implemented in order to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants saw Graf@@ fi@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian amb@@ assador , Lev@@ at D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the Chamber of Commerce between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest in Russian companies has grown strongly in the country , distributed the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
Russian companies accept existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market .
&quot; of course , the further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he mer@@ ges that trade balance between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 increases and $ 8@@ 56 million amo@@ unted to .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and bet@@ s $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade down@@ turn was reached by deliveries of machines , land@@ vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ assador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian exhibition took about 35.@@ 000 vis@@ as , first and foremost gu@@ vis@@ as , on Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which affects the tourist area in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record figures ir@@ ks of tourists in Russia will be broken by the last year , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , some of whom the Ambassador is hoping that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can personally recommend the visit of the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Sh@@ ir@@ az and Y@@ az@@ d , who received Monum@@ ents of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition . &quot;

the minist@@ ries from the sailors E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna was on the way on a quar@@ terly pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages have been done . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ wall@@ drive of all the Minist@@ ries in the past two years , the Upper minist@@ erial round St. Anna has determined to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; different pilgri@@ m@@ ons has been tested and finally decided finally for the bishop of Freiburg , where this year , at the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the Mer@@ cy of Mer@@ cy at the Frei@@ burger Münster was offered a special pilgri@@ m goal . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ ities went on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ks sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ds and divided the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; von Hor@@ b drove out by train to the start point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster , where the woman stands and so the pilgrimage was taken away from the Münster . &quot;
&quot; the single day tours were taken in the morning and in the evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and writing . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is turned on field cross , chap@@ els or churches and again R@@ ast to sing together a song from arbitr@@ ary pilgrims . &quot;

the deser@@ ved reward was in the evening a joint barbecue at the beach .
after the dawn on the fourth pilgrimage in the majestic Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che of St. Peter it went to the final cap to Freiburg .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes at home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling sport
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last evening in the fl@@ ake team Spr@@ int at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory as the British team def@@ ends the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ chor@@ age , who had made his governor Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the J@@ ain and made the legend proud , when he rus@@ hed to get a victory from the favourites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad old@@ med@@ a@@ illen . &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the trick after being in March at the Bahn World Championship in London despite the return show Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the Beijing and London problem was the replacement of the An@@ er Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as exec@@ utions .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ ring be@@ got a gap that tried to close Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man with which they remained when they saw potential in the vill@@ i that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner sat down at the qualification round a Olympi@@ ad ord , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ est vict@@ orious the New Zealand . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ des was shortly after his round , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner kept it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a big part of the transformation , in the Hin@@ du in a higher gear , to dec@@ eler@@ ate it and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked upon his position as an BBC @-@ expert and fell sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ du , when it was on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make me a name .
we have set up a Olympi@@ ad in the Final and defe@@ ats the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , he gave to Hin@@ du , that he moved to the train after a weak start . &quot;
he returned to this statement later and there was no claim of England ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; It feels with all the GB fl@@ ags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; we have come so badly at so many world titles , that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which have won seven of ten titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
if the bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months is that we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
&quot; with the Form Kenn@@ ys it is in the area of Pos@@ sible that he repeated the win of three oly@@ mp@@ ic gold medals in a contest . &quot;
&quot; this would be born for Kenn@@ y - who was just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently delicate date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a rash of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the cheese of Ho@@ y alike .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which today begins and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be k@@ ick@@ ed to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medalli@@ sts of the day , but there was more good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ er @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter races . &quot;
they came to 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world record , which in 2012 won in London was at 3 : 5@@ 0,@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) is now taking place on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with security in the focus . &quot;
&quot; he had sh@@ attered yesterday with def@@ en@@ ings before the qualification , when they mo@@ urn to himself , to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the appropriate field of women &apos;s competition , the morning continued and ended , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura du@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ ving soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ e in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team leaves itself on his strong rail rad@@ ar to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a sn@@ ar to medals .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio has been shut down .
&quot; drama &apos;s drama played in the background , such as the resign@@ ation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of Sex@@ ism and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ fen , and the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees yourself the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like that the legendary reputation of GB@@ s , which has reached the perfect moment its climax again . &quot;
future of the mel@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy range .
&quot; the future of the aluminum arrows of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - standing on the game , since the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , and thus to raise all the supply contracts , such as the supply of energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria in the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the facility . &quot;
one for 20 years of festive Sub@@ si@@ diary set out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land stand on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk of closing .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ance , since the mel@@ ting water consumption around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ zer@@ ei , which led last year to an closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risky .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum arrows with his Lo@@ y Yang A Kraft@@ werk in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared that three more owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where Chinese companies C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means another physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting , divided the company with . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to be said that the contracts are called &quot; &quot; hed@@ gers &quot; , &quot; which should have been in force from November 2016 onwards . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from that , AG@@ L is assum@@ ing that the contracts will be contributing to the income in the financial year , &quot; said the electric supplier . &quot;
all potential implications for earnings on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ us markets for major retail prices .
AG@@ L shared with that the value of the contracts were already written in the amount of $ 187 million in the &quot; expectation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; &quot; the mel@@ ting to operate or ensure the power supply to the mel@@ ting &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have been completed by November this year , even though there is still a declaration which is to withdraw from the contract . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st , due to the bad economic conditions of the sector against the possible closure of the Port@@ land Sch@@ mel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago approximately 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating sets , that would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; in a room full of guys that I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to the wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the Dis@@ closure of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ video ( with the exception of the problem &apos;s famous Show@@ biz On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she ends the cover of her sister , and that with a classical turn ends : they all have been planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the kl@@ uster bom@@ b@@ ents of a children &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the proposition , &quot; &quot; You dach@@ dly said that we would have forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon at 8 am in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let their other girls take part in this public@@ ist . &quot;

&quot; K@@ end@@ om big sister Kim she likes to see what the Vo@@ gue cover , be@@ aten ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the sep@@ t@@ ember magazine is a League for itself . &quot;
the sep@@ t@@ ember is the most widely sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles a volume of a sculp@@ tor as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) of the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his Cover@@ stars will be seen so fragile that in the last two years the magazine has not been seen before the official announ@@ cements .
&quot; women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years more &quot; celeb@@ rities , the modeling &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ rities are &quot; on the cover . &quot;

&quot; but even at the small chance that Mrs. J@@ omin@@ ator - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
this celeb@@ rities are not related to famous persons or Reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to get a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if all of it is true to the den@@ omin@@ ator ) .
they are really talented women who are interested in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career . &quot;

&quot; the director of the municipal fruit centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said , that the last survey of the National Association of Pro@@ der@@ ech@@ gen@@ centers discovered that thousands of people are rejected each year . &quot;
&quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would be worse , without a lifting of the decision of the Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; imperial city centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with in@@ sight@@ ly and aff@@ lic@@ ted debt , families that were dismis@@ sed by divi@@ ders - all these people have problems of a legal manner and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will be forced by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means thousands of hil@@ ating people from Queensland will be forced to maintain with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call for the General Secretary General and Federal Minister of Minister George Bran@@ dis to raise these medi@@ ations as well , so that people can get the help they need in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government filled their commitments to lift funds for sp@@ il@@ ations on the national average . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries of countries : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; among the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are significant losses for the SPD &apos;s SPD and CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; this has been representative surveys of the opinion research institutes , IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government , in the north , it could not be further ruled in the north , this is not possible after the re@@ vocation in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; but in both federal states the SPD would be the strongest party , and would have a good chance to continue the government of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD thre@@ w up to 24 percent in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; according to survey , the party was just below the CD@@ U that could return to 23 percent . &quot;
third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left cheese on 19 percent ( formerly 18,@@ 4 per cent ) , Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens are in spite of slight losses with 6 percent ( before 8,@@ 7 percent ) again in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not likely to represent 3 percent in the country &apos;s day .
&quot; at the Berlin Congress of Congress , the SPD of the survey was estimated to only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 per cent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11,@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented with 14 percent for the first time in the convention house .
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return the F@@ DP to a return , the pir@@ ate would not be missed in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in time magni@@ fier : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kilo@@ grams and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good at hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ w@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would benefit today for about two rar@@ er with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gig@@ abyte .
&quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros enthusiasts can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they originate somehow from the St@@ one@@ age of the dormit@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; however , 20 years ago , Communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before on the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the Communic@@ ator . &quot;
even access to web pages was possible by HTML @-@ browser if possible .
&quot; a fl@@ rech@@ ner was available , a digital addres@@ see and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be re@@ done similar to a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
&quot; quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was located at 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody was able to susp@@ end in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the Smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
&quot; smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the mobile @-@ card of the Finn@@ s lived an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled in Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market is a supplier who came all much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life . &quot;
there was almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; sold approximately 1,@@ 4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple are accessible by 555 million pieces . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
these are the well ongoing business of the countless app suppliers and telecommunications companies .
around the smartphone has now been created a whole industry .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple @-@ Chef Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and a internet @-@ Communic@@ ator , easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the descendants . &quot;
&quot; they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
mo@@ unts now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is for 20 years after his invention a matter of course .
today every German is now looking for 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; we all have to learn to put the smartphone as well , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens @-@ Board for personnel responsible . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and extend to He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw is not only in our local municipalities , and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me that was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will again be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw new possibilities .
&quot; for our local communities we are already able to create 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare for youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement ho@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great . &quot;
&quot; I have told me that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will be blin@@ ded on the world stage . &quot;
the doub@@ ters had w@@ ron@@ g@@ ated in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are still obstacles to the dis@@ appearance but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked .
how the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for single infrastructure .
&quot; enlargement is a possibility to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to we@@ ary growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in the whole GB . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw that has been implemented in time and budget , from T5 to five years in a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investments . &quot;
the London games from 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and create He@@ a@@ throw as well as create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of England .

&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would be an advertisement on his desktop page , published Ad@@ block Plus a blog@@ post , in which it acts that users may update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook with that its des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the en@@ coding on his advertisements , to make it indication about what part of the site advertising is to complain about . &quot;
&quot; however , Ad@@ block proclaimed that there has been a new way to handle new codes . &quot;
&quot; in a blog@@ post , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the ano@@ int@@ ing open source community and the re@@ akers have already been underway since the invention of ad ease , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s world @-@ largest company has left into battle for social media , is a strong indication of how worrying about the industry has become . &quot;
&quot; according to a study , according to a study from Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people ad plac@@ ements ; nearly four times as much as in 2013 . &quot;

&quot; the company has featured on desktop PCs , as mobile ad recorder , doesn &apos;t have any effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large share of revenue , so Facebook appears the investment of such a step as re@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook with that it would be &quot; &quot; ad @-@ winning tool &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over it . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook asser@@ ted that Ad@@ blocks would be worrying new filters because they would also block content on the page that are no advertising . &quot;

woman in thought @-@ su@@ ic@@ ide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls to witness after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a suspected su@@ ic@@ ide by several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman placed himself in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; to the road and were taken by several cars , the police in V@@ aud said . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a swe@@ eping at the age of 49 years , ranging from several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , he wanted to kill myself . &quot;
she died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified ; the police , which this as well as any witnesses of the incident have been asked to sign up . &quot;
&quot; it became an investigation procedure , what a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation is divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - when a person ran in the Dark Ones on the highway - was decided that mot@@ orists not going to assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night is running on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
&quot; last year a polic@@ eman of the neg@@ lig@@ ent killing has been acqu@@ itted , after they had a man over and killed that was killed in August 2014 one night on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had dr@@ unk , and has turned out on the street mind , took the dish . &quot;
&quot; the court turned out that the police reply -- which had responded to a call -- on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road had an &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should register at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably once more hab@@ itable according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus using tools and algorithms which similar to those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine if the Venus , with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once have been raised . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow motion of Venus could be explained through her tight atmosphere .
&quot; but the most recent simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , ground@@ ed atmosphere , and nevertheless slowly re@@ acted . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than the earth , but had once enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and in front of a rapid increase . &quot;
early Venus prof@@ ited from a sun which was 30 percent of matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model@@ simulation exp@@ ires the slow motion of Venus , the sun of the sun almost two months long , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which acts as a rain @-@ ear@@ m to be shi@@ el@@ ded the surface of a large part of the sun . &quot;
&quot; the result is average @-@ temperatures , which are some degree of cooler than that of the Earth today . &quot;
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that was previously thought by Plan@@ etary researchers .
&quot; although it was once inhabited , the Venus -- in the course of several hundred billion years --@@ too much heat and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light was exposed . &quot;
&quot; their oceans , v@@ ap@@ ed and its water v@@ ap@@ or was blo@@ wn away from the ultra @-@ avi@@ olet light . &quot;
&quot; as its hydro@@ ge@@ tic , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus we know it today . &quot;

the rate of the company follows a 10 @-@ tested drop for on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
&quot; the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has released for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to aband@@ on his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it is its business activities as a consequence of his m@@ ega @-@ collaboration with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation based on the decision of the British in June , the European Union had strengthened . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish parliament member Dave Ander@@ son met himself at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the major industrial disputes , which had been taking place since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only a few works , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,@@ 4 billion are expected for new projects in North Sea compared to an average of about $ 7 billion over the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler provides rotation rate of stars in the constell@@ ation of the Pl@@ ei@@ c
&quot; the latest Mission with the Ke@@ pler &apos;s space tel@@ esc@@ ope helped the complete catalogue of Rot@@ ation rates , among the stars of the constell@@ ation of the Pl@@ ei@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars in the constell@@ ation is rotating in different install@@ ments , as well as in what context the rotation @-@ time spaces are standing with the planetary glob@@ es . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we experience the compar@@ ing of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the constell@@ ation of the Pl@@ ei@@ aden is 4@@ 45 Light@@ Years of the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this constell@@ ation , which originated about 125 million years ago , are now achieving the adult . &quot;
you are now turning at the fastest .
&quot; to top @-@ cutting mar@@ ry , these gri@@ pping stars encounter large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since this win@@ ch travel by the Mag@@ net@@ felder of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is alter@@ ing , his rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of any star by identifying the time between the appear of a disc@@ ern@@ able constell@@ ation -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
&quot; the latest catalog of rotation rates pointed out , that massive stars are slower than less massive stars . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dances , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ters than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ball@@ et &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ aden we see that slow rot@@ ors to be massive , while fighting a faster red , to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the constell@@ ation of the Pl@@ ei@@ aden is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the constell@@ ation of the Ple@@ j@@ ads offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how the How , W@@ ann and Why stars slo@@ wing up their rotation rates and say their &quot; dance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported detailed on their latest analysis of the Pl@@ ating rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ aden , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star goes from
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball @-@ Star in the best days from base to base .
after his emotional return announcement the 41 years old pro on August 12 against Tampa Bay R@@ ays took a last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; to the &quot; , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ day @-@ star @-@ game participants of major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable players in the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature had been signed by a tenth year since 2007 in an annual amount of 27 million US dollars .
&quot; until the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 , he serves as a consultant and Youth coach - with full sal@@ ary . &quot;
as a player it paid a long time with performance .
&quot; 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays are only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
&quot; however , in the resting hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely to be recorded . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; - in the field was so controversial is the appearance outside of the place . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; were taken to have taken up between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked out due to an exp@@ ul@@ sion in the so @-@ called Le@@ ading sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 Parti@@ al . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the main suspic@@ ious of years of having received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Süd @-@ Florida .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said back to the south . &quot;
even his far@@ ewell days did not go wrong .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bank . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include any far@@ ewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; estimated Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the actress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with pop@@ star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson , sympathy of fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ ri@@ v@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first D@@ op@@ ing@@ accidents
&quot; caught : because of a positive dem@@ nity sample , you can not launch weight@@ ing Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
a caught ath@@ l@@ ete could have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition , the first official dem@@ ons were the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ er in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter barriers from Bulgaria and the Polish weight of Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the already critical light athle@@ tics competitions , these messages are coming to the time . &quot;
&quot; with Ch@@ en has been proven the Di@@ ure@@ tik@@ um hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mascul@@ ine remedy for dop@@ amine . &quot;
the International Sport@@ Tribunal CAS confirmed on Fri@@ day@@ afternoon local time with the exclusion of the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the finals more than 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds it missed the bronze medals . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the footh@@ ills of more than 50 m of open style .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) in the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national Association take the matter &quot; very seriously and demanded by Ch@@ en full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Tribunal CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio se@@ ated the message about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; they be inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation might be dietary supplement , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
according to the report it shall act in the har@@ dened substance to the blood dop@@ ing@@ ual EP@@ O .
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been provisional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample also has been positive . &quot;
Bulg@@ arians Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w immediately expressed criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men don &apos;t pull the correct conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; we are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all weight @-@ fever from the chron@@ ically offering , not in Rio are allowed to participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case of &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; , &quot; the London @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger was tested in the class up to 85 kg as his brother Tomas@@ z has tested three days before positive on the an@@ ab@@ ole Ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both openly deny the intake , however , both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of Ath@@ Ath@@ l@@ ete , the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another major blow to the Rep@@ utation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World association IA@@ AF had forbidden the whole Russian team to an exception because of systematic D@@ op@@ ings , which was also produced in Rio numerous bad news . &quot;
in the swimming pool the earlier associations in China had also taken care of fier@@ ce conflicts between the athletes .
so called the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ elt , li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium about 200 m of free style , I want to pass me &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French Radio . &quot;
sun was in the center of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ ds , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was tested in 2014 with the Chinese champi@@ on@@ ships , positive on the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had only had a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de ma@@ iled h@@ ackers your ran@@ som
programmer of ext@@ or@@ tion mal@@ ware to date targeted companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a current survey of mal@@ ware san@@ itation specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , partly several times a victim of a attack with Er@@ pressing software . &quot;
almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement .
40 percent of the victims paid by the perpet@@ rators demanded by the perpet@@ rators to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their Avail@@ able software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes from attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; they have been successful there , the potential for rede@@ em@@ ing ran@@ som is significantly higher than private users . &quot;
&quot; we currently observe a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of poll@@ ut@@ ants , &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programmes were still being designed to send advertising . &quot;
then we discovered the perpet@@ rators of black@@ mailing software for itself .
&quot; first , private use was the target , but the change to head@@ line took place in the past months quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware is working after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , she looks for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ press , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as according to archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of al@@ pres@@ ser .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files must be the victims money - usually in the form of cr@@ yp@@ to@@ othing Bit@@ coin .
&quot; but where in private users , the personal photo database stands on the game , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is possible . &quot;
&quot; accordingly higher the damage occurs , if a ran@@ som@@ ware proposes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German companies involved in sales losses by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to inter@@ rupt the business in a case , in a case people were living in life danger . &quot;
&quot; in Germany already several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical terms . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pays off , you only promotes the problem &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies , pay their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult , in view of stagn@@ ation in the operation the demand of the perpet@@ rators would reject . &quot;
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a current study , the safety researcher of F @-@ Secure the user area and contact with the pres@@ ets are investigated and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites , or de@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and private people are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred Euros , companies need to negotiate a bit hard and pay five @-@ dig@@ it sums in order to reg@@ ress their data . &quot;
&quot; given the potential high and relatively ris@@ kl@@ ess profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement , the h@@ ackers are always professional and sharing the work , explains Safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from Anti@@ virus @-@ providers Sophos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within one week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is likely that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their poll@@ ut@@ ants then in the form of a software building to the actual al@@ pres@@ ser .
&quot; the previous mal@@ ware kits were created by the mal@@ ware themselves , consulting and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and brand@@ ing can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the al@@ pres@@ sters are then looking for further h@@ ackers in order to spread the fresh purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log@@ ged in one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a crimin@@ als and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs . &quot;
the payment is processed per in@@ duc@@ ted calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then bear sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that do better safeguard their data .
&quot; over 50 percent of the companies @-@ it leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey , rely on Ran@@ som@@ ware using file back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if encryption of data alone does not contain sufficient threat to successful revival , the perpet@@ rators are instead of publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this makes damage potential , depending on the type of data , the damage is higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators could continue to take entirely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety for@@ scher , as they could be linked to the internet to get a thermo@@ stat under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the free@@ zing of such a non @-@ block heating could be quite a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ r@@ ator then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a subject in the industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and event@@ ual
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack all : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds fairly over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V created on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be very flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ side falls out there . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V storage space .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 45@@ 3 l at high @-@ up and 10@@ 26 l at re @-@ folded back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ bench can be found high @-@ fold , and thus offer storage space , which is up to the ceilings 1,@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk area can be easily loaded , but the charging height with 650 mm is somewhat higher than at the compar@@ ative Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide swing areas very powerful .
he is likely to make his work more qui@@ eter .
&quot; pleas@@ ing is the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km . &quot;
there is still another motor@@ isation : a 1.5 @-@ l gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a single @-@ wheel drive will not be offered .
driving is balanced and a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
the equipment can be opened in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes un@@ fulfilled .
&quot; among the security systems , the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ assistant ( works until temp@@ o 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and the Sp@@ ur@@ hal@@ te@@ assist@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ isions were irrit@@ ated sometimes , because he assessed many obstacles to the ranking as &quot; &quot; her@@ der objects &quot; . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works the tel@@ em@@ aker .
and the intelligent templates respon@@ ds to the road detection and d@@ ros@@ selt for needed speed .
&quot; but full connectivity is available only for the top facilities : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are under arm@@ rest and therefore are something aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much will receive the gas@@ oline from 200@@ 00 euro , the diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ emissions standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and all @-@ day @-@ related car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : overthrow of passengers
an air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the air traffic .
&quot; for a liability is only possible with haz@@ ards , which are typical of air traffic , the Ober@@ nation@@ es@@ court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the bul@@ let had broken down in the fall of a knee .
&quot; however , the accident could have happen everywhere - it &apos;s hand@@ some of a general life risk , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease cases : when paid the Organiz@@ er
&quot; after their trip only money return , if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel . &quot;
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms .
&quot; in the missed case , a family was difficult on the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ ur@@ ism difficult to diar@@ rhe@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
it has spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
her disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective cl@@ u@@ pri@@ ght position that supposedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
&quot; the family was the view , the trip had been lacking - and def@@ endant against the operator . &quot;
in court the bat had no success .
although the cl@@ ash was in fact def@@ ective .
&quot; however , the operator was just before departure from the bat . &quot;
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his information duties , so the judgment . &quot;
especially as in the rehear@@ sals of water no cont@@ amin@@ ants have been found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ acting among each other - were among the general life risks .
out of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 cards .
&quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , following the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people had concerns about other attacks . &quot;
the state should be n@@ uns and decided to respond to terror at the same time .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hate and split .
we will not allow this triumph to terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders had to leave the country , the level of security and strength also increase the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to reach an implementation of the proposals by the German Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personal strengthening of the security forces , namely in middle @-@ middle class order for more than several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism should be back under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the weapon quite so novel@@ ty , that especially the purchase of weapons on the internet will be added . &quot;
the most recently discussed silence @-@ light for doctors should remain intact after de Ma@@ izi@@ ères ?
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the trouble @-@ tes@@ cher for solutions , such as the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a look at mental ob@@ struc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; to counter a radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care for necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ atis@@ ed people .
&quot; for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of insur@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior have made clear against action .
&quot; this was a ear@@ ring for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke ME@@ DI@@ ENG@@ RU@@ P@@ PE ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère Ru@@ fe had rejected the union of the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and abol@@ ishing the double nationality .
a general pro@@ hibition of the full wear can be un@@ problematic for constitutional .
&quot; one cannot offer everything that one re@@ jects , and I Leh@@ ne the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
one can talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; green @-@ Chief in Simone Peter thre@@ w the Minister before , he wants to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terror packages . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ party , Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Spr@@ int and a tight@@ ening of the residence to the right bring people in this country no more security . &quot;
better traffic flu@@ ence on the motorway t@@ inger
it is a regular basis on the road road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the right balance must be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all car , motor@@ cyclists who stand in the professional traffic on the ambient road every night when they drive over the motorway from Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road construction road construction extends to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between the hammer street and the exit Wes@@ eler Road to 700 meters . &quot;
mot@@ orists can then be incorporated directly by the hammer street on the right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic shares an early stage , thus increasing the total of the exp@@ iry of the Bundes@@ straße 51 on the much @-@ driven section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District &apos;s representative of Münster @-@ West .
the driving unit on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is annoying the mot@@ orists mainly between 17 and 7 pm .
week@@ days from the return trip to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping path and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle öh@@ r on B 51 shortly before the exit V@@ eler Road .
from here the traffic will only be guided via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be recovered from a well @-@ three years ago .
&quot; the reason : static comp@@ ut@@ ations had revealed that the bridge has no longer the required hydro@@ power , in order to double the heavy @-@ duty traffic . &quot;
&quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated tri@@ ck@@ work will last , the relevant provincial operation cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to count : for the bridge has an official resi@@ dual use of up to the year 2034 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal regime , the state @-@ operation has deliberately picked up the busi@@ est time during the school holidays because with disabilities to be expected . &quot;
the traffic will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : culture for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible home . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre now plan a music project .
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s will allow young people with a migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; at the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The invisible Haus &quot; of the Young Theatre . &quot;
in the context of the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years the st@@ aging in the little house .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , schools with welcome classes have the opportunity to visit within the framework of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the youth of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and a little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ograph@@ s , the s@@ zen@@ ic pictures and video animations it would have been possible to follow the action , so the press release of the boy theatre . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from Spr@@ akel , and the boy Theatre will work in the upcoming season @-@ time as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without fluid and migration background between 14 and 20 years are the opportunity to professionally run professional fishing courses in the areas of singing , dance , swing and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the theatre game and the@@ atri@@ cal language are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
&quot; given the increasing refugee figures , the association will be calculated with many classes in which they want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of stars : hope of weather improvement
the weather has made the star @-@ sn@@ ap gu@@ ins in the South@@ west of Germany at night to Friday a stand by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was suitable because of clouds and rain , to observe the Himm@@ els@@ spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is to be good , then we see a lot of star@@ ters in the sky . &quot;
&quot; with the star@@ scale , it is per@@ si@@ ds that belong with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest constell@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they come from the constell@@ ation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening you are etern@@ ally going for ever , at night you are ho@@ ur@@ ly awake , in the morning there is already far before the wake @-@ up no longer to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , you have such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult in@@ ges@@ tion and over ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanent as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleeping disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many forms of sleeping , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aver , executive member of the German Society of Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands it apart , however , is the in@@ som@@ nie , thus a inhal@@ ation and sleeping @-@ trouble . &quot;
&quot; right now , many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says J@@ ens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , executive member of the German house@@ &apos; association with practice in the lower @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind in@@ ges@@ tion ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
&quot; it can be organic , psych@@ ic or loss @-@ conditioned factors , but also medicines . &quot;
not rarely is the in@@ fil@@ tering expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awakening is mostly with a depression of frequently , &quot; says We@@ el . &quot;
and it can be that different factors are bed@@ side .
&quot; who , for example , has a tape , can lie poor , w@@ acht every two to three hours and begins to greet you about everyday problems and -@@ worry about gre@@ ing@@ ling , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you consult with sleeping disorders ?
&quot; who has not sleeps well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and imp@@ airs the day should go to the doctor , ob@@ serving We@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look quite differently : it is tired , tired , in@@ estim@@ able , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or bodily discomfort such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to rel@@ ieve the bed@@ time , it is important to find the causes . &quot;
&quot; as medical options , among other things , behaviour changes , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping @-@ coated tablets only in exceptional cases and most for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; ra@@ inf@@ ant Schlaf@@ es exists in Germany almost , emphasises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary Sle@@ ep Medical Center of the Char@@ ité University Medical Center Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should contact with sleeping issues first at the primary school , which wo@@ unded . &quot;
the can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should be in the dormit@@ ory , and what happened there ? &quot;
&quot; for example , for examination in the sleeping laboratory medicine medicine for example with snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory controllers , with disease @-@ fatigue , in dormit@@ ory , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a single @-@ sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
it does not really need to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not have lunch , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the c@@ utter one goes to his normal time in bed .
&quot; beside the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nose @-@ bri@@ tish , a chest strap and a mu@@ zzle on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is characterized by the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can these problems get a handle on the handle ?
there are quite a lot of parti@@ tions where you can sleep for a better sleep .
&quot; We@@ ed@@ gy counts on : regular sleeping @-@ standing times , not too long in bed lying , on the day not sleeping , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol and watch at night not at the clock - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s all , and certainly not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed itself via Facebook to the disappointing ab@@ cut of the D@@ SV @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he had picked up gold in Doha for the first time in Doha and at the same time it presented his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler has set his counter@@ parts in the criticism of the ex @-@ team collabor@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ astadi@@ um 20,000 € Occup@@ ancy gets and a jun@@ k of 15@@ 0.000 € should no one be surprised about missing medals , wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old one night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ umping system in the swimming pool is bad , the ding@@ controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we can not compete with countries that do so much better and do not want to see it closely with the topic of dop@@ ing , or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be adjusted , &quot; he explained . &quot;
he wanted to launch a com@@ eback that Dei@@ bler had already been reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly that way you should keep it with countries .
&quot; whoever does not have a certain time before the World Cup / OS must be controlled by independent control of the W@@ ada / F@@ ina , must not participate , &quot; asks the choice of Hamburg , who has now been a ice cream . &quot;
airport : ban@@ ana of baggage was arrested
professional conductors at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; civil wars , the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded in the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the TATTOO were committed to bank@@ rup@@ t@@ - and baggage ste@@ els .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 clock civil officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf , a gang back , which was known to the police officers from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had been committed to several women since the mid July of July , and were very professional , working and especially professionally . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime Com@@ miss@@ ary 34 can be the di@@ vest@@ ment , who were members of off@@ ences to the Com@@ mit of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four acts . &quot;
they had a total of more than 15,000 euros .
&quot; buildings built a few lenses , meanwhile , a few lenses . the Rig@@ aer road in Berlin @-@ fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ v appears at first glance , but the police counts to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if one goes along the road from east to west , one gets to the slots , a fres@@ her nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
on the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a gray house someone has ugly !
&quot; opposite a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demol@@ ished , will already be built : until 2017 , there is a house with high windows and 133 new flats . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; tr@@ en@@ forced borough , &quot; like the responsible property company Cor@@ rich@@ sha@@ in , are preferred within the last few weeks with comb@@ usti@@ ble cars . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented ground floor , but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , H@@ enk@@ el had repeatedly called for a hard action of police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the premises were given on the ground floor , the Kad@@ tery lubric@@ ation , the police have been given for three weeks , with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , shut down parts of the street and held visitors to visit the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July the Board of Directors decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later went to police and buil@@ ders under the rejo@@ icing of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peaceful : parents go walking with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking vor@@ tex Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main characteristic of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived in the area since 1999 , and Jana * , which attracts three children here mainly from the police presence . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and c@@ entering .
&quot; it does not sound according to a way , that leads to a constitu@@ ent police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ on left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , that of the Berlin Interior , and the police between the owned and its neighbours , does not exist so obviously . &quot;
&quot; peaceful sha@@ ves in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which also has a lower average daily comparison to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; the own @-@ born projects and the bor@@ ns @-@ born projects already belong to the Kie@@ z : 1990 , numerous houses have been occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was cleared under a large police force , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the rig@@ ation and are partly inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has increasingly become the mag@@ net for tourists and El@@ ections from all over the world : with them now residents of the GDR and former land@@ lords are now sharing their way . &quot;
&quot; this has also remarkable in the rental rates , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the re@@ constructions in the Rig@@ s are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them to the wor@@ ded dis@@ ks or fresh coated fac@@ ades that were scre@@ ened with colour exploited .
&quot; no other street was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ based violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as body injury are according to almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most part of the off@@ ence make atomic alleg@@ ations made of those who are bi@@ ased , rather the re @-@ built and fresh renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is em@@ powering : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been determined . &quot;
&quot; even the famous fl@@ amm@@ ers of the cars show it directly in the Riga , no longer any longer . &quot;
&quot; for the studied architec@@ ture@@ tin , her street is not a crime point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; here one helps each other , along the road and gets more each other than wo@@ o . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately moved to the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; therefore , it was also so important that the residents got their road back : from the police , politics and the media that suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by a review of new buildings in former buildings , which are pushing the ancient inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ um housing , which are not interesting for many people - here are more people who are not so well stated , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not see . &quot;
&quot; but what should one do , if one never li@@ stens to anyone ? &quot;
&quot; on all sides frustration , also in the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for those drawn up on color bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the home@@ work and the lef@@ tist scene belonged to the area . &quot;
&quot; who with@@ draws , should be aware of it - just as anyone who draws into a pub , there is bad to complain about noise . &quot;
&quot; all of these persons have asked to be asked , not to be called by their proper name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organisational structure .
&quot; furthermore , it is a social worker on the spot . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee @-@ responsible for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ical in support team of the management at Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees himself as a contact person for all stakeholders : refugees , working in refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else might be suspic@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ vers Woll@@ mi@@ tig@@ au , which has primarily a problem . &quot;
&quot; so some - less sp@@ ott@@ ingly , as much to the multitude of desired tasks areas , as the management wanted to write the spot . &quot;
&quot; he was looking for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , even a viable w@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; most of all it is about organization , working with local people and also behind the scenes and ma@@ ins . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place on three years of temporary .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ orary and main actors . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small issues , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon new containers can be found in the washing road
&quot; a serious problem , it has been recognized for some time , apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized . &quot;
&quot; for the connection , the municipalities are responsible . &quot;
they must put refugees in their own or rented residential areas .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the country office to the Comm@@ une and J@@ ob@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been designed for some time as a very difficult time .
de facto the management does not find private apartments .
&quot; so far , it is not working so that you are dependent on private apartments , so called D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a common home must be felt as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed lead , there are internship courses , training courses , training courses , A @-@ euro jobs , and for assistance , for refugees and migrants who have to be found or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the Bau@@ yard or help domestic ma@@ ids , perform charitable work - and that motivated and very tidy , such as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that work will lead to a positive effect for the community .
&quot; this is not a employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , occupation does not only mean labour . &quot;
&quot; the day need a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a detri@@ mental feeling .
&quot; so it offers offers like sports , contacts with natives and especially lingu@@ istics . &quot;
professional courses are pure .
so I also jump into management and volunteer .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome them . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you have to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can make the time useful , for instance , with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever will develop the feeling , he could not help anybody in Ur@@ bach , would not work and be unn@@ ütz , who will never be integrated . &quot;
the most significant majority is motivated .
&quot; however , the problem is also , says a customer honestly , &quot; guys , in which nothing goes &quot; . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer must always motiv@@ ate others to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two in recent results are afraid of radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve &quot; . &quot; a res@@ ent@@ ated cannot and wants to shut them out . &quot;
the hel@@ pers were sensitive to the hel@@ pers .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
&quot; they could have fear that the attacks , they are completely dis@@ cont@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , the main and volunteer work must hold on site and in the region according to its activities . &quot;
they have always been in the background that soon a new Sto@@ cks could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this question is clear to answer , desp@@ ises the policy . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place it hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would be able to relax . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already out@@ sour@@ ced , even so far , the previous people are reasonable . &quot;
&quot; this is currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in distress , they must help them , both women are united . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complex , there is no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : lon@@ gl@@ ee with helic@@ op@@ ters wanted
the police helic@@ opter flew around one hour for different areas - un@@ successful .
two un@@ known men are for@@ ged on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 p.m. in an apartment in an apartment house in the background .
the occup@@ ant surprise the two and suggested the un@@ hol@@ low in the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 48 meters large , probably mas@@ ked , carried out both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black Kap@@ u@@ zen@@ pul@@ lis . &quot;
it escap@@ ed the direction of downtown .
&quot; to susp@@ end , the police put several strings as well as a police helic@@ opter . &quot;
the susp@@ ect ran without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown , in fact , they fell near the apartment or at their flight . &quot;
Baden @-@ Württemberg : police are determined by Ro@@ cker attack on Im@@ bis@@ s
