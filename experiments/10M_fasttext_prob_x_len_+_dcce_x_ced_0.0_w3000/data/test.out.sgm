<seg id="12">"for a long time, the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports help surpassed the man from Anhausen as part of a little gala on the Goldene Sportpyramide.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure and to prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential elections are however in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental survey."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">That is about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warned that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton concluded the economy to death and regulating death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in contrast, he himself would be quite different from the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively return to regulators, and he makes himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax movements - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton says: the state has given certain duties to fulfil, he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich increases, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the rivers, Trump and Clinton are almost worrised."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic evaluation announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure is classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-of the republicans of Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so on Trump, there might be even partial internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">Differences in energy and climate policies are evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and resume its carbon reduction in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton will explicitly aim to strengthen the renewable energies with their investment program:" "a country will create the superpower of clean energies, and millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpying-fish trade agreement, they do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US does not want to isolate the international trade - but not just American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">The should then also be better paid for about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a cause of hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise them up to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump does not want to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must renter, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side is Trump who wants to boost the economy and the citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep him before, so the household deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants to say at least from the rich, that they will pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene appears normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is an area of Condrobs, a support for social aid services in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are spotted.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Münchner North in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs made the establishment along with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauds."</seg>
<seg id="18">"long ago, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guarman in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: any woman who arrives here, has done on their flight experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are politically prosecuted, because they are torture or death, or because their families send them as Hoffors to Europe," "tells her."</seg>
<seg id="24">"for women overcast other reasons for the flight," "many steal themselves secretly, because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home they have experience with sexual violence, forced, honesty, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end as soon as they are in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"even here, women in refugees would often be considered inferior and worst in refugees."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the Munich's accommodation in the Münchner north, it appreciates her."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so unusual that they don't say anything.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often do not help to help you need more accommodation just for them, asks Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question whether she is going from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is such a thing in accommodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Schwaben are not separated alone, women were not separated alone, Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranken, there are in some common areas of floors or own homes only for the women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the" "rights of women and gender equality" "in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study that was released for the committee, it is said:" "it is very important that men and women are separated."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy or men and women are accommodated together, it may come to - continuous - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washing rooms should be separated and accessible for women to be easily accessible in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women felt in need of this protection, one can read in the urge to get it to the house in Munich."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of aliens"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands and an official end to the eight months long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterparty in the Golden Hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in receiving, I cannot deny me that Ankara won't want that reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smiles smallied, and he had little heat from himself, even for his return conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in contrast, spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard so, as if never had anything better."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite to indicate.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin desperate, sustainable cooling showed that the State of Russia had forgotten anything."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introductory article: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wasted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara, Russia fell into the back. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"the going was even bigger, since it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "the Vetrust will build up again becomes difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"months later the state controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would carry for everything to blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">"serious allegedly were the allegations of leading officials that Erdogan's own family have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which have been controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has disputed this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received Erdogan's excuse for Putin who wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the advantages of a ceasefire is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan requires first and foremost all friends, which he can get after the last month at a failed state of nearly his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have taken Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is reduced by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are added again."</seg>

<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West since it considers its reaction to the tried to look out a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the persistent pll come about the Snail of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the piping to pull the cool mood and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Russian state of state gained a bonus in Ankara with certainty that he called for the tried-rich support for the elected state organs." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-known for Moscow, a self-comprehensibility that itself has a deep-sitting fear of regime."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace made clear by the sea for Russia and Turkey, one as a analyst once described as an analysts," "alliance of aliens" ": two lands that come from the West and feel poorly treated and now hides."</seg>
<seg id="42">"however, in spite of public reconciliation, between the two still great differences."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently been playing the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey were opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after nearly three hours of initial discussions, both Presidents spoke at the press conference, that they had not even shed the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the president of Turkey announces it to answer a question about its differences, while Putin decided to stress them."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of an open hostilities - and in view of the potentials for a perfect disaster, when NATO member was held by Turkey on Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two heads of state will be at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="3">Engineers have linked the Norddeck of the Queensferry crossings with the Viadukt - which means the bridge is now connected with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four concluding the" cover boxes "," which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge-section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>

<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the tear between the Viaduct and the Brückendeck is a pagan activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the whole Brückendeck at its place and the last section of Decks now gets a betongation for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be taken on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Officer of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first lock is a significant milestone in each bridged project."</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project provides the forward-setting forward-looking forward-cutting and woofers.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last street cut and its connection to the expansion of the north deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north side or the country side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and had to be dragged from about 3% to the top."</seg>

<seg id="3">How do you respond to bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 affordable housing in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD is proposing to the next Ratsmeeting, a" "concept". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">However dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Primarily it is about the question: who is supposed to actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is already lacking.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD-FracChairman Christoph Bratmann says:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, in future 20 percent of all apartments are intended as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be made in stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the big dispute settlement in the town hall is however, as Bratmann:" how do you want investors to build on private areas? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to such areas at least 10 percent, but as 20 percent of apartments build as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban residential construction program, which will cost millions costs and has to be financed, is to provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, so Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the groups. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU intends to make investors as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to get tougher runs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of, as Bratmann, bane is a tightening of the situation on the market market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff will be needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the program is not entirely: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"how do you compare the loss of further approximately 1300 apartments, whose support will be run over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">500 apartments alone will be up to 2020 alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the planing policy of Nicole Palm, should now be purchased on ongoing bonds from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, we would have to be thought to pick back home back into the price."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western town.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">"for in the western town, for the year-to-end time period."</seg>
<seg id="28">"around 1800 apartments, one could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments."</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: we want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after all, the number of social housing in the western town is dramatically increased, from the goal of so-called intermingling."</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social disadvantaged in only a few neighbourhoods shall no longer be able to give it.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens therefore count that there will be a movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Group Leader Holger Herlitchke says:" "for a wide majority, the CDU must get into the boat."</seg>

<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that were created on the characters, which were first created for the video games in the 1990ies (later, resulting from a drawing series, game cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"how many phenomena of popkultur sank in the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go out with their smartphone out and look for Pokémons who are followed with a GPS and once they were found" "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" captured. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was even younger, joined the wahn and sprang up for the look of the sofa."</seg>

<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, prosecuted the 35.000 users, the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days of market launch of the game, the number of following people followed by 45 percent to 53 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays the Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data to improve performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to bring about 30 minutes to take" "from the sofa" "and" "every day to be active", "because lots of public messages to health are boring and coming from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the significance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly drive sport, reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, the wonderfull of Pokémon Go is that people can do something outdoors, making them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is also mürurian playspans who must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door. "</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps could follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sport as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and will leave the use with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, because of Pokemons, there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and helping many people on hunting, more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller suppressed his immune system and throws a serious test - by doing some of the most sweeptive and most-est places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shaded his course on a euro shot, a dishwasher at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher of a train toilette and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of the expulsion of each object, he used a Luminometer to show up and to show us what he will get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was recorded under the title" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", "gave some surprising results in daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to reject the dishwasher of a train toilette that has already been used by thousands, but actually may be completely bad in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to physicians and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left, what he hid, more than a poor aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of its intestines by the world traveled and peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations up to dishwashers of restrooms, the task presented its immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"he told me:" "already as a child, I was relatively unworried what my health concerns and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and skammewage."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was looking for his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the only thing he distracted, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">His prolabed showed a Luminometerisation of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to that the Luminometerisation is fresh in less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to dismissed after their Luminometerisation over 4000 units was, while freshly washed hands of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish maker of dairy products Valio produced the travel movie "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" which shows the bacterial transitions at different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "this comes the worst thing I have done in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will not miss here, because it is here inside."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company features Mr Wright with Valio Freilus, which includes both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vukovmaa says:" we really wanted to offer the consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried crazy brainstormings by that we ended up that we called "Lass us Ian call."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide the consumer more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who introduced the director of the film, added:" let me say it - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he could have relied some of things, just like the ekelective Russian toilet that is shown in the movie. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to them, they anzulecken and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies to film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by 2015, 84 per cent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria are especially associated with the well-being of gastric and intestine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally use products that include lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="4">"in 2021, the day election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for that as far as far it does not go: summer holidays, heat and counter-ricious battle - this is reflected."</seg>

<seg id="10">"the hot stage, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it also goes to something: Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, since 1998 The strongest party, is now in surveys clearly behind the CDU."</seg>

<seg id="4">And what does the Koalitionaries say to all this?</seg>

<seg id="11">De Maizière reported a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before he presents his conclusions for the safety of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the fall are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some is already known, announced, announced that there is a new security authority to take care of the baking coded communication, is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "also, not the fact that Germany must implement several EU specifications on air passengers and weapons."</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for safety authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"partly, de Maintère starts a second title for proposals which have not been able to do with the SPD up to date: he wants to impose a sympathizer for terror groups among punishment and jihadists with doubling of the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this will be difficult points for the SPD," spatial the CDU man. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he still consider it to be reasonable, and I also ask anything that I don't have any chances in the coalitionaries."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas presents de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They are partly in themselves: he plans to shift knocks for deportation and more possibilities for detention of people from deportations.</seg>
<seg id="21">"refugees, which are targeted towards the country, should let their smartphone check-in and open social media account for a safety deposit."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for expulties for expired asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or their paperers to wear their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is politically and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">"also, even unbalanced, and leaves questions openly."</seg>
<seg id="25">And in some points - when unequal treatment of puzzles for example - raises the question: what does this have to do with certainty and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">Yet it can't be asserted that the attacks were of Ansbach and Würzburg refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">Many people in view of the high refugees are worried about safety.</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that the people were deeply busier, but were not cloned in a choice of election times."</seg>
<seg id="30">Internal security is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attack in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The insurance is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are electoral struggles."</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD is therefore becoming increasingly on position in the issue of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">Over the past few days there went up between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garsty controversy over the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some Unions of the Federal Minister, in which the Ressorages will also call a burka ban and a reversal from the double citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also here for irreconcilable tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a return from the one-pass it is nothing.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have edited the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">"emerging, it is not useful."</seg>
<seg id="42">And in a burka ban he has constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether its own package is constituent in all corners, and if it is actually" "reasonable" "for the coalitionaries, must show itself first."</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot of things that could make a row.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you go to the commentrope to oversowing it under the pseudonym of NonAlleaksamenmen, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the promised reframing of sound plates do not want to welcome a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects but on midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased one record are all previewings after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely cheese group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hormone for hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older plate of flat reserve their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoying it alone time to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results agree with YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on television, I would follow the camera, while in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a humble attack carry and wildly socialize, before I resist, my hands hold and a bit of saying," so, let us take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Sohos expands slowly to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller located - there is still a handful of fantastic turntables."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the camera to turn the camera to the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (filtered): eight men middle ages, a woman, presumably about 20) succession, is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by him), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a significant number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he did not afford them, when they had appeared, when he was young and bankrupt."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things that I buy, are from the late sixties, early 70s, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, in which I was probably a bit of young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it is true that those who buy records, rather introverted and gladly spend time, and adds:" I smoother not and I drink not much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray also believes that many customers, which he meets on the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"but he also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and have prompted themselves to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I managed, people usually have been kidnapped in 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records in order to buy CDs, sell their CDs now to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to see that record, a soothing community of like-minded people offers."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to retreat to the stability of familiar mutilation, of objects, the blissful Jugenderinnings."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of the materialistic possessions than a kind of comfort," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is me as a collector that I think it is with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to be spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flax a staff of a record-stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people, the last month have bought a record, they have not heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey was also found out that 41% have a record player, which they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of news report I would probably look very concerned, while I had bordered by a stack of Bossa Nova Compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (dating speed: three men middle ages) has a" "trophy" "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone first came here recently and said," I have no turntable, but I would like to buy a radiator record, so I can put it into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a great percentage, but it happens definitely."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-lashing, less musikline."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no turntable. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who are getting slow."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has an evil audience when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women aged middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops, Wild Beasts New synthesizer and sexbepackaged pop instead of experimental Jazz drush out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks sunny, but brand psychological traumas are difficult to determine if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around a few minutes in business and looks at the variation of the sheets available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes more of a manortal-tone than a grandpa.</seg>
<seg id="50">"they do not deserve much, so the collecting of plates is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from one computer or another way but the beauty of plates is... it drives off with a verted sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, from which is said that a new generation of disk-lovers is supposed to have inspired: urban outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"as I give the ticket to musters the jeans-Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenagers who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter contemplate a crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a stairwell, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "turnout."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could give some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most common to luxuries like plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my inquiries made that the results of Yougov vote, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and turntables that exist in reality, turntables and in Onlineforen exist."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning certainly not with the bumblebees through record stores of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they raging a awkward, 30-year wrong moderator, that raging over the shoulders has nothing to raging."</seg>

<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure out of a Roy Lichtenstein Painting."</seg>

<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past that they were accused of that the app will be blackface or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week proposed a filter a filter that gave them mud, false teeth and open cheeks, there were some critics a racial caricature of Asians -" beloved "." "</seg>

<seg id="10">"the news and the rebellion were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat that it had been disabled."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was meant as a homage to Anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>

<seg id="24">"either they have no other representation of people with other colored colors in their staff, so they can meet such decisions," said the chinese American Zhu, "or they have people with other colored colors that are working there, but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint, the Snapchat is largely unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">"the company does not publish any figures to the diversity of its workforce, and indicates its status as a private company."</seg>

<seg id="17">Further investigation of the CentCom reports are in progress by the General Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published on Thursday their own findings that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015 the CentCom has created a fully restricted process for the creation of news of ISIL and the Iraqi security services, a member of the Representatives Adam B. Ship, in an opinion known."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Ship," "bogged the publication of news reports," "ashamed the morality among analysts and" "provided little space for soothing opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, Mr. Ship and Democrat gave no evidence to have found evidence on an intervention of the White House at the CentCom analyst concerning a" "political opinion". ""</seg>

<seg id="23">"Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the gamekeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>

<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline to gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminated any event immediately.</seg>

<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end gprone - but also the Grazie of the gymnastics and numb, the two sports that combines it essentially."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators and the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesting during the clashes with the police have been killed by the police force.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just bringing together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the last ten years, it was one of the most stabilized countries of Africa, a solid banker of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months the protest against the government broke up the country and spread more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people pleaded on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen climbed on zig unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the course-run videos about protests supported by the last or beginning of this year, such as security people show young people with poles, while these were forced to make a hand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN authority for Human Rights is now calling for an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country, and in future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians, to combat the terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa if at all, so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands in a respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new penser in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have constantly led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereby dispresidents were effectively brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness."</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options apart from protested, it breaks off," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground-use to the worsening in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a broad criticised choice last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this delicate, controversial line requested in June hundreds of life."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists, such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less imposed in recent years, the turbulence have grown more or less."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of dropping rose under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, very many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media because cheap smartphones are becoming more frequent and improved the internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government suspends access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does in regular intervals, especially with Protests, many people can still communicate via internet-proxies that hide where they spend."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave that they were gathered so to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons prospered the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mainly to Christian emigration, in politics and the economy, while they are the Oromos-exploited, of which many Muslims have been living and in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The main protests found in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which are about 6 percent of the population, and those in the military, are dominant in the intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebellion, was up to his death in a not publicized illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about the corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly seated to use early signs of dissatisfaction and special officers, to edit opponents and make them harmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen by relatively inscrutable reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Finland, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more blood shed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time, Ethiopia has experienced such a moil before 2005, after thousands of elections protested, according to the statements of analysts, were seemingly fueled by the government and then stolen away."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raid, many prototypes were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praising the leader for their visionary infrastructure, such as the new Pendder Standard, as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">"but obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misfortunes of the Ethiopian government."</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"the last month of the protests in Gondar, a amharischen city, of Tigray-guided shops and the hatred towards the Tigray will always be exercisable in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that protests in the US and other Western allies put into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though they recently agreed that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want to collapsed its association in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr. Abdi," "is a very thin."</seg>

<seg id="3">This clarinet threw new questions about the communication skills of the presidential data of the Republicans if he is able to communicate clear and understandable with the American public.</seg>

<seg id="5">"after having made the clearing at a election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump were back on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intended to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early tweet on Friday said Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was opposed to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump, wanted to weaken the statement that Mr Obama wants to destroy it, the Republican presidential guard did not want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism prasselt to Mr. Trump, while he attempts to direct the focus of his campaign because of random revocation to the economic situation."</seg>

<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July he moved a strong criticism of himself, when he said the Russians were Mrs. Clintons of emails, but he said later" "Natal I said the sarktically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then move back to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages from his fans will be taken, and then if necessary" "frame" "depending on how the reaction falls." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, which observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of deprived the tone of the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even estimated sound, since its refractional values have gone back."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a guided tour with big advantage in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in head-race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally tried to apologize for his provocative statements, he accused his critics frequently asked his statements or to understand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is increasingly focusing on attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal co-streites into the uncomfortable situation regardless of how provocative may also be his statements."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps celebrities, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked for the accuracy of Mr. Trumps, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called her ambassador, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republican attempt to argue that the government under Obama, served in Mrs. Clinton as an Foreign Minister, it admits to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and cast them before him on each of his words and be taken toward him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he betrayed the" poor, jamic "television professionals who try to understand him and said," You Can't know it! "</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönland usually arrive only in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation aboard the Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with well a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie will only get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"tilted the Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, in an hour it comes in an average of 1,220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five meters long shot at satte 2,6 km / h - and is with this maximum speed half as fast as a robe."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this of long-standing lifestyles, however, seems to be a silver bullet for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal" Science "at least Grönlandhai, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Schecken from the Max-Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock these life-span that means for vertebrates a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist had long been that Grönlandhaie steinalt will become old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Grönland-haie are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice-caves in front of the skinny coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they dive at the surface mostly only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of Greenland-haie researchers know researchers accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their timestempo maize it when they were up to Svalbard six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot make this shark anyway: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a robe, another had swallowed the pines of a young icebergs."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly hunt them sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the icmeeres and look casses which are of higher water-layers after bottom-swings.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as an example from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, during the largest 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed it with the carbon-14 method the lens of the sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyelet is already created before the birth of the sharks, which included in it may no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks was striking a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie after the early 1950s, as an atomic weapon-weapon larger quantities of this radioactive carbon stickers into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"with 220 centimeters in length, the left-sized animal contained the lens with a small excess of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland-haie had in its lens, on the other hand normal carbon-14 amounts, which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 centimetres long Greenland at the age of 335, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters even might be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönland-females only then got up if they are longer than four meters was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to assign the length of an old age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years, Grönland with the multiplication is obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this might be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"even the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland Greenland, in whose bacon at Nacken a 120 year old harp tip, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures often the organism of the living animals live on asble, too."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they are then later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"to keep the cold water warm, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, through which the animal heating system."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram is therefore much larger than at one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendents as early as possible," "explains the theory of evolution."</seg>

<seg id="38">"over 50 percent of the companies-it leaders in the Malwarebytes survey, rely on Ransomware using file back-ups and scannersoftware."</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if encryption of data alone does not contain sufficient threat to successful revival, the perpetrators are instead of publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"this makes damage potential, depending on the type of data, the damage is higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators could continue to take entirely new goals on the internet of things."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you are eternally going for ever, at night you are hourly awake, in the morning there is already far before the wake-up no longer to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, you have such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult ingestion and over ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanent as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many forms of sleeping, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weaver, executive member of the German Society of Sleeping and Sleeping Medicine."</seg>

<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are bedside.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a tape, can lie poor, wacht every two to three hours and begins to greet you about everyday problems and -worry about greingling, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you consult with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who has not sleeps well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and impairs the day should go to the doctor, observing Wedes."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite differently: it is tired, tired, inestimable, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has moods or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the bedtime, it is important to find the causes."</seg>

<seg id="25">"who should be in the dormitory, and what happened there?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, for examination in the sleeping laboratory medicine medicine for example with snoring with respiratory controllers, with disease-fatigue, in dormitory, or if you don't find the cause of a single-sleeping disorder, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">It does not really need to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not have lunch," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cutter one goes to his normal time in bed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organisational structure.</seg>
<seg id="3">"furthermore, it is a social worker on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee-responsible for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogical in support team of the management at Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"she sees himself as a contact person for all stakeholders: refugees, working in refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else might be suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the eivers Wollmitigau, which has primarily a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so some - less spottingly, as much to the multitude of desired tasks areas, as the management wanted to write the spot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he was looking for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, even a viable wool."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"most of all it is about organization, working with local people and also behind the scenes and mains."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place on three years of temporary.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle honorary and main actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small issues, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers can be found in the washing road</seg>
<seg id="17">"a serious problem, it has been recognized for some time, apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">"for the connection, the municipalities are responsible."</seg>
<seg id="19">They must put refugees in their own or rented residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the country office to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as a very difficult time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the management does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it is not working so that you are dependent on private apartments, so called Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, a common home must be felt as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed lead, there are internship courses, training courses, training courses, A-euro jobs, and for assistance, for refugees and migrants who have to be found or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the Bauyard or help domestic maids, perform charitable work - and that motivated and very tidy, such as Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that work will lead to a positive effect for the community.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is not a employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"however, occupation does not only mean labour."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a detrimental feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so it offers offers like sports, contacts with natives and especially linguistics."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are pure.</seg>
<seg id="40">So I also jump into management and volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome them."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you have to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can make the time useful, for instance, with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever will develop the feeling, he could not help anybody in Urbach, would not work and be unnütz, who will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The most significant majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, the problem is also, says a customer honestly," guys, in which nothing goes "." the work of Deuschle and customer must always motivate others to motivate others. "</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two in recent results are afraid of radicalisation, even in a small church like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no, Regine customer says quite clearly," "what some may call naive". "a resentated cannot and wants to shut them out."</seg>
<seg id="50">The helpers were sensitive to the helpers.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">"they could have fear that the attacks, they are completely discontented."</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, the main and volunteer work must hold on site and in the region according to its activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that soon a new Stocks could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "this question is clear to answer, despises the policy."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place it helpers on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, this would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already outsourced, even so far, the previous people are reasonable."</seg>
<seg id="63">"this is currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in distress, they must help them, both women are united."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complex, there is no simple answers."</seg>
