Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of an international agreement as well as about Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; but at the meeting , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussion of the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing expansion of Israel and cast a clear will at the peace process .
&quot; thanks to the deal by the Obama &apos;s promoted deal , the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu had a comp@@ uted talk at the invitation of Republi@@ cans before the U.S. Congress , which was interpreted as an argument against Obama . &quot;
&quot; speaking with Obama was not talked about , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the im@@ min@@ ent election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in a call , Professor , his girlfriend were shot to have shot . &quot;
&quot; in a not@@ ary , Professor Sh@@ annon told a slightly z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that his officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably be excited , and he said the family @-@ contact the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officials found the Lei@@ che of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ driven note that I had known on a white block , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed . &quot;
&quot; there was no reference that represented in two online courses for the Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Mississippi , signed up already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he killed a popular history of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door of his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Political advoc@@ acy Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that in the fatal emergency @-@ call then did it afterwards .
&quot; by the end of the day there was another death : lam@@ b took the life , when the police were captiv@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; a day after the shooting at the University , the students and teachers to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by investig@@ ators on both ends of the state as well as what students and staff who knew him , told , helped to draw an image from a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said that they were looking forward to their teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he said , he did not have any history of violence or a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; he was he mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both published in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teachers are 17 members , and many students visited courses from both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , the Lamb , said , he also seemed a bit of excited and nervous as if something with him is wrong . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
&quot; in yesterday , the Delta State University had asked for a complaint for health reasons and said it must have some health problem . &quot;
in this year he set only two online courses .
&quot; recent amendments in the University &apos;s employment policy , meant that the promotion , for the Lamb has worked so hard for him , for him , no guarantee for an automatic path to a position as Assistant . &quot;
&quot; university President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he caught nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot;
they are questions that can no longer be answered .
&quot; after the flight from the campus the police found the Lam@@ bs lane , when he returns to the Mississippi from Ark@@ ansas import@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house approximately a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car went still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 he started his work at the university that has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he received his doctor@@ ate in the spring of Ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs made it as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met by common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were at high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing . &quot;
at that time he was the wom@@ ens warm .
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted there when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson County of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick building , which was adjacent to one of you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said , they were trained 15 years ago , but friends have stayed and a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
you and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played music . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail three years ago both on a summer year@@ .
later they played together one or another .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings their own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sh@@ af@@ fer , a bar@@ ke@@ eper and sometimes sub@@ sist@@ ence coordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak illuminated bar in the vicinity of Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ous Night in the night 5 September for the last time , having completed his guitar accordion and harmon@@ ious . &quot;
there was no sign that something was not voting .
&quot; simply just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the au@@ fr@@ aming and jo@@ king with one another .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar programme and specialized in American natives and colonial history , Don All@@ an Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ansas and was president of his Br@@ otherhood and of the student committee .
&quot; at the Delta State campus in C@@ lev@@ eland took part for about 900 people , including instruc@@ tors , staff , students and members of the municipality in a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the championship team , during the &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ borro@@ o Soli@@ s reported from C@@ lev@@ eland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans tru@@ ders this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected , to res@@ ist that the police did so , after he had created the emergency , and that lam@@ b drew Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two had ever married . &quot;

Michael J. Fox jo@@ kes on his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also distinguished for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is adjacent to me , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I can im@@ itate a simul@@ ate and one arm length of it , with the prin@@ cess of Wales on a Date . &quot;

UN Chief declares : there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of lasting conflict ; and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN Chief calls once again on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , a press conference held on Wednesday that he is planning to discuss the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member countries of the Council - U.S. , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the Vatican meeting held in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ ts that the revol@@ t in the Council and within the Syrian people and the Regional Po@@ wers &apos; situation make this situation in@@ sol@@ uble .
&quot; in Strasbourg called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tackling the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear de@@ than with Iran . &quot;
8 revers@@ als that demonstrate that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have read it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ can try , Donald Tru@@ mp run from the upper ranks of poll@@ s in terms of opinion , it has ( yet ) does not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in two @-@ dig@@ it areas , and some begin to seriously consider what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the property of Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
of course it is too early in the election period .
none of that claimed that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that this time was given by Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of whom ever won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; however , external groups like J@@ ef Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now realizing syn@@ ergy &apos;s stamina and begin to le@@ ash their dollars to overthrow it . &quot;
here are some current modifications to indicate that the Real Estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Pop@@ ular values have been gathered around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans looked positively by the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
by mid @-@ July there were 40 percent .
it was 52 percent in early August .
&quot; now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; about three of ten say , that they have a negative opinion . &quot;
and these figures remain in the early states .
&quot; a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa has found last week , that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp . &quot;
two thirds of GO@@ P &apos;s voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would be either &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; just two of you say , they would be &quot; angry , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates the same enthusiasm , as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same over Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 per cent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; , &quot; if J@@ ief Bush , the Favor@@ ite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would be . &quot;
a majority of the Republi@@ cans see Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and bel@@ lied statements , 52 percent of the French republi@@ cans believe the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first subur@@ ban state of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a com@@ mander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent , that he does not have the personality to be effective , and almost six out of 10 in@@ depen@@ dents said that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House of p@@ asse , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they put their advantage , Republi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
if they are asked who won the GO@@ P nom@@ ination attack after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp will be the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten will put their money at J@@ ef Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters do not have the clear@@ est cryst@@ all@@ ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans , that Rick Per@@ ry would gain the nom@@ ination compared with only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters of Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign can be seen as a plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Republi@@ can gathered around another Candi@@ date , Tru@@ mp is still nearly every . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that the spl@@ itter box is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidate diff@@ use . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical mind @-@ on @-@ heads between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is the majority of support . &quot;
&quot; he has before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ ief Bush 19 points and finally in front of Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ an @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only Candi@@ date , who strikes him ? &quot;
Ben Car@@ son would pick the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical mind @-@ to @-@ head races .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp @-@ fans say that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only somewhat more than half of the elect@@ or@@ ate , the Tru@@ mp support , say that they have awarded their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that and no one can really say to change the opinion . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said that they leave the door open , to switch to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tru@@ mp was held in his election campaign against two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; , &quot; was the immigration and prot@@ agonist in public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tru@@ mp is determining the His@@ p@@ ano Americans from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / Post survey , six of 10 Republi@@ cans are saying that they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration in the spot@@ light remains , there will also be Donald Tru@@ mp seem to be done . &quot;
the frustration of the government climb@@ s to new levels .
&quot; by Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , there is now about half the support of Republi@@ can constitu@@ ents , above all through their out@@ si@@ der status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Io@@ wa republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by 54 per cent , dis@@ satisfied with 54 per cent . &quot;

Champions League : Bavaria - Dream@@ start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double scor@@ er in Pir@@ ate : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happy article by Thomas Müller took the FC Bayern the way to a conden@@ ser 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ re@@ aus - then it ran .
a sou@@ ver@@ er pr@@ el@@ ude the Champions League @-@ season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have taken the FC Bayern at the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pir@@ op@@ ters a dream start in the &quot; &quot; mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola won her tac@@ tical game in the Champions League with the Greek record Grand Master Olympi@@ ans ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ols hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth Anniversary Tour will be the first step towards finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot;
Müller received at his 28th place in the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ guided Mi@@ th@@ ilfe from the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ alie Roberto which would happen as a fl@@ ang@@ ing shot of the world &apos;s master .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate , &quot; did Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ am@@ k@@ akis stadium , promised before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner held word . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated and dedicated concept , with no to shine . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his recent six home games in the Royal class , among them against rep@@ utable clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 I stum@@ bled here Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els were defeated with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
they went cour@@ ageous - but with their obvious efforts but often to einf@@ all his works .
the attacks was led to often by playing dirt on lef@@ t@@ ances Douglas Costa Rica which occurred against the former Br@@ uns@@ wick Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller took over from the right more luck , when his fl@@ anks struck out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper entrance . &quot;
at the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , as the Olympic Tur@@ k Stor@@ ye Brown proposed the head of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct acceptance , the go@@ alie Roberto with the knee par@@ ized ( 35@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; although Bavaria was acc@@ ust@@ ed to her in the dominant game , pir@@ ate was re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated . &quot;
on door@@ ke@@ e@@ pers Manuel Neu@@ er was fine .
&quot; for instance , when he took a shot of ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te len@@ ght ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had a quad@@ rant with David Al@@ aba in the center near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario id@@ ols , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ res , sat first out there . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero did not get green light after the final stra@@ ining , he said assistant Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that is now mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; even at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sl@@ ey Com@@ an for the attached Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; id@@ ol@@ i@@ dol rose late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ meters , Müller took an eye on . &quot;
in front of the game it was in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ alle .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly mixed up of Bavaria @-@ fans in her vie@@ wers @-@ Block , the p@@ endant of hosts pir@@ ate with words and ges@@ tures , attacked the security forces and went with stri@@ ps against the Mün@@ ch@@ ner followers . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan has been viol@@ ated out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk to lose teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , therefore cuts not only the lungs , but also the teeth - which places a central @-@ long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : when moving the risk is fast .
smokers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this goes out from the long @-@ term study of an international research teams , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , there was no risk to lose their teeth in contrast to the 2,5@@ - up to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had watched more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major contribut@@ ors for dental loss , c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ um g@@ um , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
in this par@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor that emphasize the authors .
the relationship between smoking and dental loss therefore go back at most frequent to@@ g@@ um inflammation in smokers .
&quot; not clear , moreover , smoking is also increased the risk for tooth decay . &quot;
&quot; people who listen to smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it could take over ten years , until the threat goes down again to the level of non @-@ smokers , &quot; said Kin@@ aut@@ or Thomas Diet@@ rich of the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; people convince people of it , non @-@ smokers to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; leader of a Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shorten@@ ed the life time . &quot;
not too smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads to our findings also to a good dental health until high age .
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population are affected by dental anxiety over the age of 65 to 74 years of dental treatment . &quot;
previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking increase the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study @-@ stor@@ ing the findings .

in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists were now five .
&quot; from text documents had already been known , that in place in the 4th century a fortress , and in the 8th century a church met , explained Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; beside particles of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;

the German government announced their support .
TTIP must be created to create the world &apos;s largest free @-@ trade zone with 800 million people .
plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings have specifically presented that the EU states and the USA have to share independent judges to a new investment market .
&quot; they are to come from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
it is for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; to date , the procedures involved with each other on arbit@@ rators , a in@@ consistency against their jud@@ g@@ ments did not exist . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work according to its own information on an international investment district . &quot;
&quot; there , however , conflicts between Chinese companies and EU states could also be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration required above all to be considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against the TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by oppos@@ ers as a kind of parallel , covering the company damages , national laws , or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
in first statements anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act signi@@ fies the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate .
critic@@ ised especially that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German Economic Under@@ secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) signed the plans on the other hand as big progress .
&quot; the Commission considered important points at the reform key points , the Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked out in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als may be of the table .
the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; the European business association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe war@@ ned to limit the economies of the economy through too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged as it was .
&quot; when talks about the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , on Wednesday further unclear . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since the middle of 2013 .
&quot; however , the subject of investors was not yet discussed with the United States . &quot;
a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer durable .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ate in the prime minister of Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut on the prime minister of Prime Minister with excitement is expected for his election .
the new Labour chair Mr Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut in the prime minister &apos;s question and put forward for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will raise themselves to noon on the first of his six asked questions shortly after lunch and his performance by the media probably and the Labour MEPs are checked .
he called &quot; less theatres and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
&quot; he also said that he could ski@@ p out some sessions to leave them colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as she comes to his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting held on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime the decision of the Labour chairman , on Tuesday during the singing of the National hy@@ m@@ ne , has been prov@@ oked during a commemor@@ ative ceremony to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , and is the center of several theme stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Decision not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne has attracted attention
&quot; he said a narr@@ ator by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , he would have been &quot; in resp@@ ectable silence &quot; and he did the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the a@@ erial bombar@@ d@@ ment of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told by the BBC Two News@@ night program , he has come to the Labour chairman , &apos; independent &apos; of his belief that the monarchy would be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow minist@@ ries have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership team , and they conven@@ ed to differences in the economy , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a six@@ teenth of the Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary party was initially supported as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political dent correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences arise within the Labour Party , while by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of persons . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that resulted in Labour to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of working and pensions ministers , that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the ruling plans , reducing the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour chairman , David Cameron , since then he has been the T@@ ory boss over the last decade about the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour chairman , which promised a different policy approach , says that he received &quot; &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and have given him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister for Prime Minister is to be con@@ front@@ ational , and that he has put down both &quot; head@@ aches &quot; and fighting with resistance , and instead of focusing on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told him that Angela Eagle , the shade of the minist@@ ries , if he is not participating - for example , when Mr. Cameron is on his way abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues can occasionally take the word , and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the under@@ house , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was the leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was often linked to the Prime Minister in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre - &quot; but some years later he sp@@ elled that he has failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first sent in 1990 in 1990 , the questions with the Prime Minister as the principal bar@@ ometer of the urine was reported in a leader , and his position among his parliamentary groups , although critics were argu@@ ed , it has become a caric@@ ature and considerable @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pounds increased by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the Po@@ unds went up @-@ nicely according to data , which shows a rise in wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the target price SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July the result of no bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2,@@ 9 % compared to the same pre @-@ year period . &quot;
&quot; this percentage had been the fastest , and ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents at the time of an interest au@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % compared with the dollar at $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was up to 0.00 % compared to the euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 13 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
&quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % , after the acquisition of Rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received . &quot;
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were aimed at encouraging messages from the competition for luxury goods charges .
right sales figures offer all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for bur@@ berry - growth and growth .
&quot; shares of Glen@@ core clim@@ ates 5 % , after the mining hypoth@@ esis said that he spent 2.5 billion USD by a stock exchange as part of its strategy of debt recovery . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper Group MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers in the index , and with a decrease 4.9 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set up his estimate for the company rating to &quot; sell &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D sports grew by 3,@@ 1 % after the sport exhaust for the half @-@ year by a pre @-@ tax result of 46,@@ 6 million . &quot;
the chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more cost @-@ strength in the po@@ ckets of the potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power is the higher work costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D sports , he added , and this might mean there are less extra jobs . &quot;

potatoes or bri@@ efs ?
&quot; it is both - and indeed in the potato di@@ ver , developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger Im@@ bis@@ s@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; at a poster the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement has put Al@@ h@@ ay Pot@@ ato and meat together to a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the in@@ scription of &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had to be seen by the television . &quot;
&quot; since then , in its shop a BBQ wine , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ultur@@ al for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has become the Leb@@ anese with the pat@@ ernity in Munich in the meantime .
&quot; here , it has been protected by the authority of the authority as a manual pattern . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ h@@ ay wants to bet@@ ray this . &quot;

Met@@ abol@@ ism launching ground @-@ dig@@ ging campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ ric tries to protect the Ig@@ A Fili@@ ppo outside of an Al@@ di @-@ R@@ ise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ dig@@ it campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ al@@ ore and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets are delivering their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A by mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing over social media , just as events as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
Ig@@ A @-@ traders and suppliers are jumping on board with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ borough that sold at Ig@@ A @-@ Shops and Lad@@ der@@ ers who sell tickets for the South Australian Football division to loyal customers .
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ abol@@ ished further details of its defence strategy on 29 September , when the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices le@@ verage its annual investor strategy . &quot;
&quot; much of the game , since South Australia and Western Australia can almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ a @-@ shop@@ pers and higher swe@@ ep@@ ants as Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A network in the East states . &quot;
&quot; shopping Hotels in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to some 14 percent in the United States . &quot;
&quot; however , an@@ al@@ ysts as Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di is twelve months after opening his first markets about five percent of the food market in these two states and all existing actors , but mainly independently of independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A ret@@ ailer gives 360 $ million sales per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million to the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened 25 branch in the next year 25 branch in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate sales of 500 million $ and $ 600 million in every market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and grocery store , and with the amounts on Met@@ cas@@ hs high @-@ cost @-@ base , Met@@ cash cost roughly 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the East states , mainly to Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ Gal@@ ore are the most faithful . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley takes up that Met@@ als are sales in the food industry and grocery stores around 3.8 percent in 2017 and 2.3 percent in 2018 - will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 per cent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will likely van@@ ish within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash borro@@ wed it to react publicly on the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
&quot; but it is assumed that a coun@@ cill@@ or project came in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass , last week . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ cas@@ hs food and food trading , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A ret@@ ailer , has since 2012 increased by 43 percent , which is reflected by the operating debt recovery with high @-@ quality printing on turnover and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ alers is popular however , and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ to supply prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths to improve their stores by faster growing fresh food and provide a better choice of private label food products . &quot;
Met@@ cas@@ se &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the prices and shop san@@ itation programs are put on in ver@@ ve and hopes that the wholes@@ alers will return for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years back to a profit growth .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis was supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis deserves more praise as criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; &quot; in the recent storm round his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves a view of the president of the Australian tennis association , Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ k@@ akis , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always described as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; with the in@@ famous examination of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ d with the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ k@@ akis had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rators , whereby Har@@ rison cri@@ ed twice through the arbit@@ er : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ inka would have to beat K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; last seen , as he was last seen a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ amp fought a potential US Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ k@@ akis was approached by Heal@@ y &apos;s excellence . &quot;
&quot; the teen is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in order to second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing , about which I was pretty , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et , when he lost it because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open but he is not the first player who took a r@@ ack@@ et from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has acted extremely well in the US Open extremely well , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison , and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around you , he has a great family around you , and I believe that he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very rei@@ fer 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he doesn &apos;t work in the team and so on , he has never been a problem with other players , he is good in shape , he is a very stur@@ dy and more mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision to take K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in the important pre@@ decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not all round the controversi@@ es around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and I believe Nick was very quick to grasp what people like Feder@@ er and Murray . he rise in the eyes of the public , and he deserves to support him , we try to think it appropriately , and it is best for the team and it is best for the crew and it is best for him . &quot;
European refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency and ex@@ cludes refugees
&quot; Hungary declared the emergency and broke the border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all of who tried to come illeg@@ ally to the land . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants accumulated in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Serbian officials with rebellion . &quot;
&quot; people who fled before violence , were stuck for a unknown period in a landing at the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents , and settled down there . &quot;
but fru@@ ity clim@@ ates .
&quot; as a police helic@@ opter of them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and sh@@ rie@@ ve ins@@ ults against the Hungarian polic@@ emen . &quot;
some exp@@ elled from protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said &quot; &quot; it is &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral agreement .
in the coming days we must take place talks with Brussels and other countries said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence at the ung@@ ary @-@ Ser@@ b border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ block at a hard meeting in Brussels could not agree on a joint immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility of 4@@ 0,000 people who were buried in the over@@ ed Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved for further 120@@ .000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not turn their hopes on an verbal action from Brussels or his neighbors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the official state of affairs in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to get out of the crisis , so that they could reduce streets and asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ os@@ to said that his country also means the construction of a thorn @-@ wi@@ za@@ us along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it has ended a fence at the Ser@@ b border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even Pr@@ ac@@ companies reported in the race , to create the bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck in the Middle East and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , President Viktor Or@@ ban had insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic migrants are in search of a better life , and non @-@ war zones that are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction with other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws passed in force around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 meter ( 13 feet ) high fence on the border to Serbia on the southern edge to Serbia , to be a crime . these laws also set higher charges for jud@@ g@@ ative mass@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the situation that was created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of state , &quot; said the spokes@@ man z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ a@@ ń@@ ters in the southern City of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still fully agree on the military use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ por@@ ter of Associ@@ ated Press reported on the limit difficult to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ ers in Or@@ ban , said authorities 45 people trying to cross the border to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across , def@@ ying the fence , they are now mis@@ er@@ ased , and shall accused of off@@ ences of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are there to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border comm@@ its with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and thr@@ ust a crowd of crowd around it . &quot;
&quot; about 20 I managed to come up , but thousands were staying outside . &quot;
&quot; another group of migrants blocked the main highway linking of Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary . &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Cl@@ oth@@ on &apos;s advantage against Bern@@ ie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton remains a two @-@ dig@@ it lead in democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Bern@@ ie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the floor . &quot;
&quot; Clinton have now supported the support of 47 percent of democratic voters during the presidential elections ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders are second in the second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed whether he serves for the presidential office , with 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion stands , what candidates will support them . &quot;
but Cl@@ int@@ ons supporters are more pre@@ acher with their choice than that of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton have lost in a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders had achieved some profit . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a great advantage in women and moder@@ ation , but these le@@ aps have reduced . &quot;
&quot; your support in the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders are just with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; cl@@ int@@ ons advantage of democratic constitu@@ ents under the age of 50 has escap@@ ed , and they are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; though , Clinton had a big advantage with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton had a double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders had now a 5 point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections , say that they would support the party with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the Party . &quot;
a quarter would support them with some advantages and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the nomin@@ ee .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Cl@@ int@@ on &apos;s current supporters especially from you are excited .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would love them enth@@ r@@ alled .
&quot; while 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters do so by its peak performance Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Cl@@ int@@ ons supporters can be asked in an open question why they want it is the most common response that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; by Cl@@ int@@ on , also their connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) are also mentioned . &quot;
agreement to handle the problems and the voters are also c@@ ited .
&quot; as the Vice President Re@@ jects a potential for the presidential office to the Wa@@ ag@@ eing , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; when democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; by Cl@@ int@@ on &apos;s followers say more than half , that they would be their second choice far from otherwise . &quot;
&quot; in case be@@ ating , not for nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Cl@@ oth@@ on lead in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in competition on 30 points without having him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to gain choice , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage of which it regards as &quot; most sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , democr@@ ati@@ cal voters have questions about voting . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , no single democratic Candi@@ date or potential candidate for these voters of presidential elections are being unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results with some important characteristics of voters in the elections of their party .
&quot; multilingual , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy , and equipped with strong leadership . &quot;
Bible cuts in the three candidates best at honesty while cl@@ int@@ ons strength is the lead .
&quot; thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 % ) but 27 percent do not have any opinion of it . &quot;
democratic voters of presidential elections generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ec@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Cl@@ one &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address , and a server during his term as foreign affairs , most of the Democratic voters of the elections are happy with their declaration of the matter and say that their opinions were not affected . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; now , half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion occurred in March , just after the problem came to light , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans also said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no effect on their general views of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has still deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 , who have seen their views of Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them under Regist@@ ered constitu@@ ents : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the vote do not hold it for an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the legitimate nation@@ als also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton and Tru@@ mp are also given good notes on leadership . &quot;
&quot; of the six tested candidates ach Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush on the best at honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards both differently from honest , but as with Car@@ son , we have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; the error rate for the sampling of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the presidential elections , amounts to 6 percent@@ points . &quot;
Ben Car@@ son &apos;s back in land@@ es@@ wide survey near Donald Tru@@ mp on
Ben Car@@ son &apos;s latest survey is provided by C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; in the meantime , half of the support of voters in the new pol@@ l fails , and others lose dramatically at the level . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can farmers strongly support Tru@@ mp in large numbers . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey taken from Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son flo@@ wed in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that car@@ son deals well in demo@@ graphic groups and embr@@ as@@ cri@@ mp under Republi@@ can constitu@@ ents with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio governor John Ka@@ aba , who liked Scott Walker who liked the deepest , which is by 10 % support last month at now 2 % . &quot;
former governor of the former governor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located 6 % on the third place .
the Tro@@ u@@ ge in the sampling of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can constitu@@ ents in this recent survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week reveals that car@@ son in the surveys will increase - it arrives at 19 % support among the republi@@ cans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp significantly before Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to one of the last week of rising car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for it , Tru@@ mp@@ s faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on last Saturday during a campaign show in Io@@ wa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently warm up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if the peak values are measured only in the distance , sufficient for bath@@ ur@@ lau@@ ves already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even more hot water . &quot;
a dip in north or Baltic Sea should be a maximum of 17 degrees at a maximum of 17 degrees .

five members of the Br@@ otherhood deb@@ ited with the death of a cur@@ se College .
&quot; nearly two years , after a student during a schi@@ a ritual referred to as a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , will mo@@ urn for five persons . &quot;
members of the New York City &apos;s College P@@ i @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si Br@@ otherhood captured by Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and consumed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , distributed the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said it had been bur@@ dened with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ l@@ b back@@ pack of sand , and repeatedly sh@@ elled as he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g cl@@ ams finally about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less , and waited a hour before they brought it to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to contact D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to contact his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Br@@ otherhood , to get advice , said Poli@@ tic@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members , uten@@ sils began to hide and put the good of the Br@@ otherhood , in principle on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ tic@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died on the next morning with his wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; after an automatic de@@ generation , Den@@ g have been repeated with st@@ umped force injury to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the chic@@ ory of the Br@@ otherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 every year , he said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable ; and this step of authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indic@@ t@@ ment due to mur@@ dering the third round of Gr@@ ades for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ thirty members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with a crime and a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the people involved but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - this has been sanc@@ tioned , we will also account these to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Br@@ otherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
&quot; an zinc @-@ cave is coming , and the house will come into w@@ aking , return for bonds , and the economy is gli@@ ding into a recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only low guidance for the procedure . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increases and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggression of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and the funds will respond . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. central bank have so strongly empha@@ sized that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase the interest rates , but rather to the time period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
in the end they could realize that all the excitement because of a Zin@@ ation cav@@ ity could possibly be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will happen to be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of the &quot; cheap joint &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , we do not expect a gradual return of U.S. interest towards normal heights , but still too low levels in order to cause sei@@ sm@@ ic shock , which seem to be afraid of . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a focus on historical trends based on how some areas of business could react :
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the withdrawal of zinc @-@ cave may make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ le . &quot;
&quot; once the increase has arrived , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that investments are recovered from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects its delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ st in a newer study on what is going according to Zin@@ ovi@@ ca@@ vities . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has mostly been in the last 35 years - almost 14 percent - on the way to zinc etching , fairly flat in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , Chief Planning Officer at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , purchased at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares will rise later in the increasing cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic activity but Zin@@ ir@@ ism often promote growth .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed was confronted with some conditions that previously did not give it and which can accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; most remarkable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point , in an Zin@@ ation ca@@ vities . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , since 1950 , since 1950 , since 1950 , in 1950 only twice the nominal GDP has been under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 rose by 3.8 percent , only a few expect this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; Zin@@ ation ca@@ vities with such a fragile economic setting could be risky and throw the question , &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants adopted the whole year on an Zin@@ ation ca@@ vities , and all eyes were directed at the face of the Federal Open Market Committee during this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many shr@@ ines and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could need an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures trading exists only a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the pro@@ ving cycles of 1950 to present in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum when GDP had taken place and on @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ öh@@ en very quickly responded to the beginning of recovery in the shade , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is now 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the firm income was also vol@@ ati@@ le , because the market takes a success in the market , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect in bonds is faster than with shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; when bonds can bor@@ row the return , once the first raise / lowering is done in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increasing cycle , the An@@ lei@@ ant @-@ cycle fall off immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; Str@@ at@@ egen of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to that yield between longer and shorter bonds can be closer together , and lead to a down@@ turn in the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ rate bonds often bring better revenue , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come P@@ come in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , Jones means that the markets have already adapted itself to F@@ ed strategy . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to strict monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the income curve is flat@@ ter , borro@@ wed have increased and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has intensified their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and all over the company , which will benefit most of their business operations in the United States , if interest rates are rising and local products are more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts are worse off as an ending of the dollar is making their products on the global market more expensive as well as the financing of their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares must be extremely positive for three months after an initial improvement and said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; firms with a strong balance sheet have out@@ sour@@ ced companies with f@@ aded balance in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
&quot; companies with high capital yield , as well as low vol@@ ati@@ lity in their shares , also pen@@ alties their counter@@ parts with low quality at the average of 4 ( percent@@ points ) and 3 ( percent@@ points ) . &quot;
debt be a major problem .
&quot; company with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , the gold stated . &quot;
&quot; outside of the pure stock , consumers will also benefit by the increasing dollars . &quot;
&quot; Spar@@ ers may see profits via higher income , even if experts have different opinions how fast this will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says assistant member of Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the channel for its &quot; &quot; du@@ cts &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not able to distinguish increasingly from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also zi@@ pped on the BBC Music Awards and said that she was only The Br@@ its im@@ i@@ fied
Parliament &apos;s colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , maintains a leading parliament member and increases new pressure on the radio station , prove that he does not do anything that does not do the private . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the publicly @-@ legal radic@@ als &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and is increasingly not distinguished from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; word - but it seems to transform herself into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also zi@@ pped on the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards held last year , the Br@@ its seem to be only under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous @-@ mentioned examples , where you actually just im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General Manager dismis@@ sed the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to public music and educ@@ ating the public . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m not going to learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music @-@ music that is really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , finding new music and give new works to order , I consider also really important . &quot;
&quot; beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to work on how it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport focused on the ped@@ est@@ ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins handle The Voice to - the musical talent show by the BBC , which was purchased by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for valued 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ? &quot;
&quot; Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; &quot; produced in special BBC @-@ way &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he added , he wish you the company &quot; &quot; hit a hit from our in @-@ own barn , &quot; if it was the next time a convers@@ ational work . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to ex@@ clude the order from additional ranks of The Voice of The Voice into the Future or to ex@@ clude the money of the pay@@ ers for other sub@@ sist@@ ence formats . &quot;
Internet resolutions in August on the slo@@ west and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
last month saw the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using Hand@@ phones to Buy Shops
experts believe that the Black Friday has slo@@ wed down in November the issues
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping is flour@@ ished and many of the Great Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into Spirit @-@ cities . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now signs that the online sales will stagn@@ ate , after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the period in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales will stagn@@ ate after new figures only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , that over time has evolved over time , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales team . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales revenue grew over three years ago , when shop@@ started with her cell purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now the one , and we will perhaps experience that growth decreases . &quot;
the black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is considered a reason for wan@@ ing changing versions .
&quot; experts believe that buyers share their purchases on this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computers in order to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer was fought for bar@@ gain , buyers to ab@@ ide by the purch@@ aser . &quot;
&quot; a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium was found , that a bit more than 1 £ spent on a bit more than 1 £ date . &quot;
&quot; with some products such as television and wash@@ ers , more than one third of the purchases are now being conducted through Web @-@ shops . &quot;
at the same time more than a quarter of men wear clothing and shoes online rather than in the decoration .

the number of qualified craft@@ sman from Eastern Europe has a rise
&quot; this leads to that 200 other screw @-@ fix stores , which aim for trad@@ es@@ men , can be opened &quot;
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q Sales covers a wide range of sales .
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
it is asser@@ ted that British their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their home ;
&quot; if you are sent out with a hammer or a brush to cont@@ enders of walls , nowadays you seem to be a minority . &quot;
&quot; for British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , to carry home @-@ your@@ sel@@ jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Véronique Lau@@ ry , new chair@@ men of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craft@@ sman from Eastern Europe , offer services on low prices have now been out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open up to 200 other screw @-@ to shops that connect to trad@@ es@@ men and to close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said that she wants to explore more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made in the store by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment l@@ ull with the staff the men . &quot;
&quot; she said , it is necessary to show up the growing demo@@ graphic trends that show more female single @-@ households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our clients are made up of women with 80 percent of all decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry who listed one of only five women in the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index @-@ listed company has also re@@ directed their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied just 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and financial management . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Super@@ visory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her announces a decline in the half @-@ year @-@ figure and the way in which the group charges the cost of cut off the shops .
&quot; because of the trends King@@ fis@@ her , the scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has , 200 new branches will open . &quot;
functions of A@@ ich t / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; at the regional Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt , on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian Volley@@ ball @-@ Viz@@ em@@ ma@@ ers A@@ I / DO@@ B must be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and issu@@ ing education . &quot;
the accused are not guilty .
one of them was also charged with ministry &apos;s abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been fre@@ ed in May of law . &quot;
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the ruler Robert Ri@@ ffel ag@@ ened , he had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the pre @-@ investigations that the accused in the years 2006 to 2011 funds of club accounts , which they have been dur@@ ate in their capabilities for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage to the damage is roughly 40@@ 0.000 Euro . &quot;
the sports functions are also charged with financial difficulties .
&quot; this fact divided the president of the op@@ ener , Rich@@ ke@@ Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , put the defense of the association , that the association had not been a asset in any event . &quot;
&quot; the sports functions were only calculated and the Sport@@ club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and have spent a lot of time and money , from the debts owed - the passi@@ vity bet@@ s in 2001 some 60@@ 0.000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood in front of the situation : do we continue to un@@ lock the club or lock it up ? &quot; , &quot; he told one of the def@@ endants , at the Br@@ ot@@ r@@ f M@@ ub@@ am@@ ity of the Financial Officer . &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , our life insurance policies must go away as safety at the bank , &quot; he said at disposition . &quot;
&quot; with the association was agreed : you can manage the money freely , there are only no debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of appropriate financial - success , the payment of the pre @-@ made repar@@ ations had been determined retro@@ active until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should pay part of the Rec@@ ord@@ ings only years later , that from 2003 , when a plus had been on account of the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , they also seemed to be a l@@ ump sum and not detailed explanations , explained the former Chairman of the former Chairman . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and au@@ ster@@ books managed by the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endant . &quot;
&quot; why the payments have not been disclosed to the association in detail , asked the jud@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in the financial statements , important only for debt freedom , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the official shareholder of investigations , an amount of 120,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ appropri@@ ations , had been the accused . &quot;
&quot; this paper account went on the name of the second def@@ endants , and according to its statement , the association was not known . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
after this the respon@@ dents knew no answer before that .
&quot; then he finally said , he believed that this is the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor was placed in the room . &quot;
&quot; the accused would have been notified , justi@@ fying the function of the function@@ aries . &quot;
these transfer was formulated as &apos; damage re@@ tention .
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? you did not want to know the jud@@ gement and prosec@@ utor .
&quot; after that the first accused , he could not agree with this formulation , because the association had never been killed . &quot;
&quot; but what shall I do if the couns@@ el says , &quot; with whom you are all out of the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ aries , he never appropri@@ ated one cent sal@@ ary , he only anticip@@ ate o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; if he attended the association 1,000 Euro per month , the actual effort was much higher than he added . &quot;
detailed documents for the early years could not prove invali@@ date .
&quot; these are after the examination , in which everything was judged correctly , no longer asser@@ ted them . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter also had the second complaint .
&quot; all containers can be made in cash , so that he must go from his residence to the bank to the bank of St@@ ay , in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings will continue on September 23 with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard st@@ adding another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to running staff , the computer fast@@ ening will be re @-@ hau@@ l of additional jobs for three years now . &quot;

&quot; the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate clients . &quot;
&quot; this means that costs are saved in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.8 billion ) , the company distributed on Tuesday with . &quot;
the step will lead to a special load of about EUR 2.7 billion which will be expected from the fourth quarter .
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed . &quot;

ös@@ s : violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police voted on the Ser@@ b border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Water@@ lights against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has helped the force of violence at the border control center .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees dro@@ wned the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen were ready for a water light .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began throwing with stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials were initially un@@ interrupted pe@@ pper spray .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
lots of lac@@ ri@@ ans was spr@@ ink@@ le in the direction of the refugees .
so the group was dis@@ solved .
the refugees have now taken a little with@@ drawn .
a pregnant and apparently the last woman was carried away from the zone .

the time of choice on interest rates for the U.S.
&quot; the world ob@@ serves if the US addresses is working on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time in nearly a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half the last week of the view was that F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that F@@ ed will last a little longer and the interest rates on current state of 0 - 0.25 per cent will last . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero @-@ sector and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ ab@@ ide , Chief Executive staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ llion dollars will add to balance sheet and generate just low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rust@@ less outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the markets to adjust to a raise , but the signs suggest that chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 AM CET on Thursday .
death ar@@ cher at the Delta State University
&quot; after the shoot and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later started his colleague and sl@@ ay - Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that it would &quot; p@@ ity &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he can make it un@@ happen &quot; , &quot; gave government on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that lectur@@ er , lectur@@ er for geography and social education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he had shot on someone and someone killed . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s said to the staff of the emergency , that police officer would be able to send polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house , &quot; &quot; but no one will inter@@ rupt , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller according to his name , but he didn &apos;t give him . &quot;
he &apos;s given no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as the police of the scene , they found the human body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a written notice of Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; &quot; I am sorry , I could not do it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the Noti@@ fication , represented 300 miles to the Delta State University where he E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , sl@@ ay before he finally took his own life on Monday , when polic@@ emen hit him . &quot;
&quot; university President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he caught nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb told that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities on Tuesday , there will be no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was turned by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was about seven years married than a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago , but were friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss have had a daughter who is 19 and she is &quot; &quot; destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss gave her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was online from home , according to the statement by Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a tight friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog called light@@ ning , who had been with him for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said he was inv@@ oked at a certain date on Monday to say to them , &quot; he is not in prison . &quot;
&quot; as a polic@@ eman him late in the highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , he continued his car to the side , ran into the woods and killed itself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 , he received a Doc@@ kl@@ ash from the Delta State University and holds a Doc@@ kl@@ ist on the University of the University . &quot;
stars that have lost their god@@ wit@@ ty
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long term partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of Cancer . &quot;
the actor also claimed to fight with drugs and in 2008 he was condemned because of drug owners .
all this requires certainly its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group of group construction .
half a billion euros in the year will save the Lufthansa Group along with a better organization .
&quot; in 150 of the worldwide roughly 1000 managers , the Group will cost the workplace . &quot;
the pilot &apos;s union is now part of the new negotiation .
the Lufthansa builds on its corporate structure and also vali@@ date the Euro wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ign@@ ment is a result of approximately 500 million euros per year from costs and refund syner@@ gies , divided the airline on Wednesday . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play months for dou@@ bling cont@@ ac@@ upuncture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League &apos;s defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven a double frame of his right leg .
&quot; while this was the left bank to wines and ex@@ clude it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a consider@@ ate assault by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V .
he was treated nine minutes on the board and needed oxygen before getting to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg of leg and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be published tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then surgery in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United is very hard and then fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen @-@ mask .
he cri@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frame , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed to be happy to escape a Red Card and the suspension of a mo@@ ck .
&quot; Nicola B@@ izz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ect that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had v@@ aded itself .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a misery and a red card were due . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ h account granted : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how Bro@@ ken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I am getting stronger again . &quot;
related : Manchester United gained the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of the PS@@ V
England &apos;s def@@ enders has an additional incentive to recover in France ahead of the European Championship .
&quot; Philli@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; It is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player is leaving the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Moreno has suffered a leg , as Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he is very tough because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you then hear it is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said C@@ oc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing that I could see was the ball , which was in a different direction , so it looked like it &#91; Moreno &#93; but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 , Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad in that way . I am sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought into hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ting of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better knows ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : when your child loves a book , it will not long before you know it almost . &quot;
&quot; unless , you are perhaps David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child book was decided , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 were created by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , he writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I would like to read my children , as it always appears to have a picture or a message which we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron alleg@@ edly describes the story of the book , instead find a basis for the film version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to extend the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a good , hopes to win a boy by Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , his real name Theod@@ or Se@@ aline ho@@ stage and the 1991 died , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this were not yet suspic@@ ious enough : that of Cameron presented , partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy by Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he agre@@ es to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able to put Cameron the action of the book so little . here &apos;s an un@@ question@@ able boy , such as the local environment by the cash @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ oked , sn@@ ake @-@ colored beings , &quot; who speaks the name of the trees &quot; , &quot; devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who has not read the Lor@@ ax after 20 consecutive years for a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text was probably arrived by Camer@@ ons V@@ oting .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons employees were delivered , but there were no further direct comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you choose the cad@@ res that has chosen the England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card . &quot;
I would not ex@@ clude an exp@@ on@@ ward .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing assembly , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , only a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it is a well @-@ known size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; in this case @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th , from the England test header and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; to release the decision , Adam Ly@@ th , is of course for me as his chief editor in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but tough reality is that cri@@ cket@@ players are on result . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to nom@@ ination , since - and I told this - players are their best selection . &quot;
&quot; for a long time ago , one has prolonged the course of Ly@@ th but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully has further le@@ asing out for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not deliver as good performances , and this was not surprised me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time an Test @-@ stroke will get to put his mark is difficult . &quot;
&quot; ly@@ re got seven chances , as Sam Rob@@ son came before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton did nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton has got the chance to do it home and down@@ ward .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that you can raise was that England was first set in the Caribbean , while England was first set in the Caribbean , but this lost chance now lies in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a trick that I estimate highly . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he recorded 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which hit us very successfully . &quot;
&quot; he has to get at least the same chances as the before him , but this depends on the team of sponsorship in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to suggest Mo@@ een beside cook , which would bring extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four wells would get up , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a perc@@ ussion@@ ist did not beat there , and this lef@@ ty has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een did not have his job for his County Wor@@ ces@@ ter@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately abol@@ ished three hundred of us immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he greatly impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics on - average 31 with the R@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of back@@ ups which have raised their hands and the coaches have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made a few smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ uya , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the Games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; it is one of the nicest guys of the game that will bring an abundance of experience , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful bet into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as Coach , and how Mah@@ ela he has insights , of which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air , even if the news is in line with the previously predicted . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , is not used during the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team members do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as when players depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions will not be made of light heart .
Bre@@ xit @-@ bearing ( Bre@@ xit = exit Great Britain from the EU ) could participate in Zul@@ u when the economy up to 2017 in a built @-@ in machine
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced new building strategy to hold great Britain in the EU , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , which was sp@@ ill out for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at was hop@@ eless@@ ly said that some member states , so deeply moved into different crises , as the EU is now times and not always from its own debt , Britain itself er@@ created agenda with seg@@ reg@@ ated conc@@ es@@ sions and trouble @-@ changing contracts , which they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bright@@ on , the TU@@ C decided on their annual general meeting , that it may not like it to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Ministers go to summit , or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of yourself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they will win the allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who is looking for an outside @-@ looking United Kingdom inside the European Parliament - &quot; L@@ ass does not leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us know that more and more short @-@ sight@@ ed ministers and officials come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we remain or go . &quot;
&quot; German ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an association , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them , like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande can look back on his re@@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a non @-@ ass@@ ass@@ ent force .
&quot; Poland will soon become a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will be a leg to get out of the sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British to help Scotland their energy better , Scotland &apos;s resign@@ ation out of the UK - something that they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers might even un@@ visi@@ bly not helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while in Britain &apos;s refer@@ en@@ stupid process to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , suspected my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a pl@@ itude , and &quot; the UK won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street may be at its expense and which EU sk@@ et@@ ries the oligar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one is , as did not get it during the Tony Ben@@ n inspir@@ ational refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms in 1975 but not , that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they are able to remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ unity , who made a name for itself as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ad @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ years . &quot;
&quot; with all his de@@ ity , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing , the phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able foreigners and the pseudo @-@ countries that most of our major newspapers have . &quot;
&quot; actually thought Tony Bl@@ air thought about it , but set firm that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you get better ban@@ anas in order to distr@@ act him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more bl@@ ur@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air , when he himself acted as Camer@@ ons refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ ver@@ er , because Bl@@ air was rejected by the constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 having been opened to him an amb@@ assador . &quot;
the press has never missed him too .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on Monday in Westminster , I told him that he leaves no time for me to waste time - seems to be in danger , N@@ eil kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ he years to repeat , an error at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it can last but it has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , his BBC &apos;s sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position about Europe is - I just put it friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU . &quot;
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blu@@ ep@@ tive tendency and the wild plum@@ age of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ism anyone can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &apos; Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said , &quot; &quot; said the boy sc@@ outs in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell , a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s , when his old father was acting on television to settle , loyal to his Labour cabinet counter@@ part , without losing too far and to lose his cab@@ inet@@ job job . &quot;
turn @-@ to @-@ day fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight in all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell , nor what J@@ C told his fellow @-@ journeys and members after all reports on their closing days . &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants - remember that he even has stir@@ red me up - News discipline will be important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a n@@ abo@@ de of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ ee campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins always thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ ui@@ ties for EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite A@@ ag@@ ation economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is a central rule by dog@@ matic dispute . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties to the N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not have a campaign to resign@@ ed , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin w@@ asting political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ es@@ sions to the British when all this can be point@@ less ?
&quot; the US has already been rather disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , which was reminded of what was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England via E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; alleg@@ ations of a state funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful as smoking was made up of a meeting of 12 persons , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , told researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the British Medical Journal ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Grund@@ ner report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have dealt the res@@ ili@@ ence of the data and transferred to the links between several experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a Editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; exceptionally win@@ dy &quot; &quot; at the p@@ he its most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers write to BM@@ J and have asked whether the alleg@@ ations &quot; will build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Neuro@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public would expect the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the present best estim@@ ation is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria @-@ decision makers ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis -@@ MC@@ DA ) to perform their opinions about the damage from various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ ted products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that a sponsor of the meeting had been a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose director has previously received by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the testim@@ onials of BA@@ T to the Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they told them . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants stated in the meeting to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he has received after reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of this body are not supplied , but include several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champion , some of which also specify a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco @-@ wire took part .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; blo@@ ws reve@@ al@@ ingly &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ hic report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that the alleg@@ ations of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes can serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; professional Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J was previously responded . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at its addi@@ ction .
&quot; all evidence is close that health risks from e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared with that are minor , but that we continue to have the long @-@ term effects to study . &quot;
&quot; he has the unique duty to inform the public about what is evidence and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative danger related to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people annually die in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking will cost the national health system two billion £ a year . &quot;
&quot; through the clear indication of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
BBC should give to East@@ En@@ ders - says former head of Channel 4
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should cease to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square so@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the radio tax should only be used to make the type of programs , which will not be sent by other UK radio stations . &quot;
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC for making them publi@@ ci@@ zed publicly legal programs , which are probably seen by a smaller audience , in hard disp@@ uted time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from stations such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Manager , Tony Hall , the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends , which also clearly showed clearly from non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the radio @-@ fee , what I consider medium or long term does not consider a good idea , one should do not adopt its production on programs that others do not make or give a job . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class position , because they want to achieve as far as possible support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it is natural nonsense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
honestly speaking other channels would give their right arm to this .
I am trying to see how this should be public @-@ legitimate TV .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur of series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for valu@@ ations &quot; because of the ambitions of the people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the popular ship@@ ments of BBC give the back , what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather non @-@ legal niche programmes should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they do not meet their tasks , and they can argue when they have on their apparent missions to the justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ broad@@ casting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have seen all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window in which no one would ever see them .
&quot; to the broad@@ casting , Johnson said the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course you think all , remember that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year here , but for people who is for 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they consume not much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein , who also asked before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC de@@ part their fri@@ th@@ ian Mission to make up and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , just a little about the BBC production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in the publicly available TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada as an example . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television is shown , and with the commercial operations , to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound @-@ waves
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des is changing the direction in that moment , in which it should be pun@@ ished with sound impul@@ ses . &quot;
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by ou@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they have known with Klang@@ impul@@ ses , which have heard for human ear to high frequencies , should be pun@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; the impul@@ ses work through the power of Mot@@ h @-@ eur@@ on@@ cells , which are modified gene@@ tically in order to respond to the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ as@@ ound . &quot;
further information on this topic : researchers read and write bra@@ activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , in which ultr@@ as@@ ound can be used to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day stimulation could be replacing an invasive technique that gives electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people for treating the Par@@ kin@@ son disease . &quot;
&quot; thread cells usually respond not to ultr@@ as@@ ound but Chal@@ as@@ ani concluded that they did it , when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , reinforce the ultr@@ as@@ ound waves , which enter into the lit@@ ters . &quot;
the reinforced ultr@@ as@@ ound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels and can be found in the membrane of some of the wor@@ ms cells .
&quot; Sh@@ rank@@ shafts indu@@ ce the opening of these ion@@ izing channels and activate the cells that are assigned to , so a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , changing Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms , that some of their mot@@ h mon@@ opo@@ lies TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels . &quot;
&quot; when he turns into altered creatures on the changed creatures , the mu@@ c@@ rank@@ shafts are reinforced by the micro@@ bor@@ es and into the wor@@ ms , where they have changed the changed motor @-@ eur@@ on@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetic tool , a ground@@ breaking tool , the scientist allows to re @-@ fr@@ aming neur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of the light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ic@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , that must be sent to an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ as@@ ound tissues can happen and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make or@@ derly human neur@@ ons temporarily pr@@ one to the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical attitude for certain neurological therapies , &quot; &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications might focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student dormit@@ ories
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ able 19 @-@ year @-@ old fellow in a student dormit@@ ory , but only now I recall the tense sm@@ iles which I disp@@ le@@ ased - and to the numerous , lasting discomfort via others . &quot;
most of what I learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the pull @-@ up into student dormit@@ ories ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking up to absolute fright@@ ening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to beat : people tell wh@@ ence you come from where and where you &apos;ve won &apos;t be afraid of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you honestly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in the Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it acts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you might not talk in contrast to those with whom you wouldn &apos;t talk , even if your lashes were turned into fire and fire extingu@@ ishers . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people are often transformed into beverages @-@ recipes , film @-@ night venues , and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people are attrac@@ ting themselves and their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : do not think to start the university with a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refu@@ ge but many students form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ w@@ um@@ mel @-@ culture , which can be friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be hell for someone , who is trying to recover . &quot;
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continues to go , but you have to go away so that I can get the energy back that I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a cl@@ as@@ sm@@ aker is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
A@@ pro@@ pos ank@@ ing : do you do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a non @-@ developed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship is made through b@@ aking .
&quot; since you begin the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the monastery is present at the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange as the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s years , in the neighbourhood , I got something baked . so , and now please smile if I present you some personal questions . &quot;
&quot; to offer homemade food , is a good way to make friend@@ ships . &quot;
their ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to maintain themselves and become in the end maybe your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends upon whether you are a decent bathroom . &quot;
&quot; poorly mixed cl@@ ots of fl@@ our , sugar and fat , cause people to sleep asleep when you anchor . &quot;
ste@@ al food is a common crime in student dormit@@ ories .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chickens is a rob@@ bery , but is it the Take a drop of Mil@@ chs for your tea as well ? &quot;
check with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to themselves self @-@ serving even if they cook in the inside .
&quot; when someone takes your stuff , is the annoying , and you have my sympathy , but try to handle it as my ro@@ ommate , that added to her milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
it is now in prison .
you should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a conceived man , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the sentence to the people who are in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbours if it makes them something short , Drum &amp; Bass something quiet , for it was 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
it re@@ acted on it with even more amazing music .
&quot; when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly left their neighbours to sleep two hours before they left their own music , closed their door and settled down to their three @-@ hour test . &quot;
would it not be romantic when your future spouse would happen to be able to move into the same dor@@ m residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be deeply embarrass@@ ed if you maintain a ro@@ ommate for your future couples to get rid of them and then encounter them each day and perhaps experience how to move all together friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own paths - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try to talk at least to talk to your shelter . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice , that somebody has his key in his not wi@@ ped room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing f@@ einer , as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good strike is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
lets you place a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but don &apos;t forget someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ amp@@ oo .
&quot; close their door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you then put into free@@ zer - but stap@@ ling your pos@@ sessions at the ceiling is no longer than twice . &quot;
&quot; terr@@ aced houses for refugees , all@@ ot@@ er@@ ers , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ ner &quot;

&quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal , &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing , but also the mother and the righteous person . &quot;
&quot; I show how to make still cheap and well built today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepreneurs Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes in knowing how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds up in a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics has no sustainability .
for people will remain a big part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee stream , we need a lot of living space over the coming decades . &quot;
a very ban@@ quet , tri@@ bul@@ b brand is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ing : a town@@ house in the least amount .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different if one under@@ takes the people in living space .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently built in the pilot project , consists of three units of four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be converted easily according to the respective needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house flo@@ wed to 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is over@@ looked .
six months has taken construction .
this is appropriate .
do the buildings have not complicated their plans ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : &quot; &quot; I have destroyed my project correctly . &quot;
especially complicated it always makes the dro@@ wning of d@@ amo@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ se special structure and the job @-@ space order .
gr@@ aci@@ on .
&quot; it is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in cities is missing for that .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their self @-@ service department ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were which ones have thrown to me , luxury built for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what is definitely not true .
but exac@@ erb@@ ach you not the competitive advantage for inexpensive apartments ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true is true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we were built luxury apartments , which can barely afford a longer . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal human beings . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the Mother alone or the Ger@@ ing@@ ye worship . &quot;
I am showing how to make cheap and well built today .
that is what it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by check@@ out for &quot; &quot; gener@@ alities &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have been stolen after the installation on problems , since they receive a error messages that failed to update the &quot; software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to deal with the problem , users is recommended to either wait until the rush is returned or trying to update over iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do this by wearing the updates . likewise , it will be simpler to do so if you delete a special tool , and then re @-@ install it once the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is loaded during updating or located near a charge unit , so the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the cargo is too low , Apple does not leave that the update will continue as the telephone may be switched on half way and this could lead to a break@@ down of the updates . &quot;

Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ entr@@ ausen .
&quot; moreover , Sam@@ t@@ community debate Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ists in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
doctors in many places in the country have no luck : Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice field at Dr. Frank Müller on October 1st .
&quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ hau@@ ausen in the reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing with a half place in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ building phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12th until then he will invest 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first glance , when the Fel@@ lowship has met years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll who currently completed their professional dental care in the Ver@@ dener hospital and will also join the practice in practice . &quot;
&quot; we had always in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when I was , I simply called it . &quot;
Couple Müller took the idea to continue to have their own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he can soon be his own boss . &quot;
and so one was agreed that the gar@@ bage I bought the house with the practice .
living they will continue to live in Ober@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there the two @-@ fold family @-@ father Frank Müller grew up , his medi@@ z@@ inst@@ al@@ dium in Hanover and followed in a number of medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;

from 19th September the practice for the new manager will be prepared .
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ hau@@ l works as a pedi@@ atri@@ cian , has specialised his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) on the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle for as a general practitioner . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes thus out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after re@@ modeling the spaces are modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and manufacturing EK@@ GS and need a single room anymore .
the ED@@ V will be completely renewed .
&quot; a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 euros , the gar@@ bage cans get within the framework of a funding program ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continuing to continue , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ ville deb@@ tor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; approximately 2000 patients come to the practice field such as Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter in the practice field , in the north practice practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is another pet office .
a positive effect @-@ effect of the practice case by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ entr@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if no successor would have found , it would have been gone . &quot;
&quot; who attend the Müll@@ ers Expert , will continue to look mainly in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialist and the cleaning force of the field . &quot;
&quot; with their part@@ ing ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all the medi@@ ators have been doing for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; rec@@ ir@@ king ri@@ gh@@ ausen c@@ aster . &quot;
a little melanchol@@ y they noticed after the long time already .
&quot; but we live further in Hohen@@ moor and will see many patients probably still frequently , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; your husband is compl@@ emented , &quot; We have a 6000 m @-@ meter plot . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have always pushed me up with gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls will also be passed on to our border , &quot; &quot; said the Minister of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel to this .
&quot; however , it is clear that everyone who want to make a asylum application this can also be &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the provision and safety of people are at the forefront .
&quot; but it is clear indeed that there were clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept the bound@@ less Mig@@ rations - not about the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia does not deny &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously shared the coming refugees to travel toward Austria and Germany and also to build cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
&quot; however , I saw this Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar in Stav@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia is rather more intensi@@ fying the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; however , the border with Croatia was already strong controlled as the limit of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the minister stressed , Slovenia wants to have Slov@@ ene borders with so its borders for refugees but not dis@@ su@@ ckl@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its commitments otherwise , otherwise the system cannot operate , &quot; &quot; empha@@ sized Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like Croatian government , the first refugees had already begun in the evening hours for Tuesday to take place in East Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to turn the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could take it on in the near ma@@ is@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik have been meeting the police cars with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is predominantly around Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot;
service services and the Red Cross are already in action .
over the coming days his country will be reck@@ oned with some 4,000 refugees who said Minister of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which had hitherto brought to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade under@@ takes , however , that they may refuse to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we nor do we want to do it , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , the first bus had arrived in the morning a first bus with approximately 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the passengers had been on the road the whole night of some 500 kilometres away from the distant Ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has gone , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany further . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it could actually actually advance the shifting of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Hungary to a little further west @-@ situated . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; full options to border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s interior ministers O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong state of refugees , for possible plans for possible exceptional situations . &quot;
&quot; he did not find it , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member have &quot; full access to &quot; &quot; border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
use strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently featured a good testimony to the level of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the German border , there are still about 300 refugees crossing the Hungarian border au@@ n . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of H@@ org@@ os , who goes to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing H@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees now wish to reach the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Minister of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa St@@ ano@@ vic tried to re@@ assure Wednesday , on Wednesday at a local mountain , in H@@ org@@ os , when the Hungarian border is now closed , for breakfast . &quot;
it would currently not be very high refugees .
&quot; it is not possible , however , if they would continue their trip over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee centres have already begun to re@@ distribut@@ ing the refugees maps that are marked for alternative routes in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the bor@@ derland , there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian conflict is still not given yet given min@@ ef@@ ields . &quot;
on Wednesday morning the Croatian police announced that a team of reduc@@ ers was sent in the border region .

&quot; life is about life , so we went through action in the midst of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the leader of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ iz@@ aid is available for questions and discussions as well as volunteers .
&quot; while man@@ ch a Pass@@ ant spont@@ aneously transmitted to the Chal@@ k and then read the proposition &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long &quot; &quot; suppl@@ emented , others say &quot; &quot; how far I am not &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; repeatedly , on the ver@@ ge of small discussion about the action on themselves , life , dealing with death . &quot;

therefore this public action is good for 20 year old .
&quot; if everyone wants to communicate openly on the tablets , be understandable , but finally it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the issue of death and dying is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine lam@@ bs , while doing so far the Hosp@@ ie movement has contributed much to the people &apos;s movement . &quot;

&quot; the lower sight continues despite the price increase , average of 4,@@ 9 percent and on the 4th of January are effective and despite higher cuts for soil transportation of heavy and large packages , which will be charged in November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless er@@ ased that the result would be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in on @-@ line trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company takes a solid income , considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in production and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holidays &apos;s employment were announced a day later than that of the ri@@ val@@ ant UPS announced , 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workforce , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amo@@ unted to a $ per share , just behind the $ 44 per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked an@@ al@@ ysts . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks inter@@ viewed an@@ al@@ ysts expected to accept € 23 billion .
Fed@@ Ex has launched a decline in recent years with an international pri@@ or@@ ship shipping cost which carried out sales in its On@@ eness Express shipping costs .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was even flat because of higher cost of larger packages and self @-@ assurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express Scribe declaration recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result declined because of higher labour costs in the freight @-@ business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex @-@ shares increased by 3.7 million , or 2.5 percent , on 15@@ 0.7 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they joined 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent , under a record high on June 11th . &quot;
on its most anticipated meeting in the years Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen have spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table in order to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade .
&quot; dro@@ pping over them at an end of the late , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seating sa@@ is is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that F@@ ed @-@ chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ way order from the congress : maxim@@ izing the U.S. employment and price here stable .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is a third @-@ lasting mandate : financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight in order to pre@@ di@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be un@@ reconc@@ iled since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows sound , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets eman@@ ate the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed @-@ Repres@@ ent@@ atives to increase this vol@@ ati@@ lity through raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just about one quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first instance will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief econom@@ ists in the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were searching for an excuse to increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market has enough justice , continues to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what can be damaged in itself the financial market .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , who were recently inter@@ viewed by Bloom@@ berg , are predicted that this week was predicted . &quot;
&quot; financial markets are however expecting a wait for F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an indication that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the shr@@ ines increased the blow by promising that another boost is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday sp@@ rang the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage around 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or around 1.1 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 99@@ ,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations , that F@@ ed @-@ policy of sust@@ aining the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief of Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at this time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her declaration in order to calm the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t get into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a Zin@@ ation ca@@ im@@ ation would calm the financial markets , because it would act in@@ security when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; still a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the phrase about 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of the mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and in early summer , that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that would be more economic progress would be required , an increase in the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , the improvement in the labour market in this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; unemployment rate sank to 5.5 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level , which sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
wage @-@ delays have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly carried out under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them on the labour market because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief Physi@@ cs in Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets on the whole world turned into the end of the last month , after which China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency . &quot;
&quot; by the D@@ ow Jones Industrial aver@@ se , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial aver@@ se fell by more than 16 % among its peak , considered investors that a slo@@ wing of the Chinese economy would increase the global growth of th@@ rot@@ tles . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered a little in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now about 10 % under the end of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed Representative , the market turbul@@ ence impact the complex calculation , when to raise interest . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese business in recent weeks would not be occurred , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employees of the U.S. central bank . &quot;
&quot; he says that she will wait at least one month , in order to get better control of the impact . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; global economic health is none of the key requirements of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the final sense the F@@ ed Monetary Federation has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere reference of the former Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ anke in the year 2013 , that the F@@ ed would fall its mon@@ ary expansion &quot; &quot; close &quot; &quot; confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly linked with each other , it can not only be super@@ vised by the F@@ ed Representative , but also to monitor the development of other central banks , but also with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , commented on this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of over@@ reactions to financial market movements , which apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als data . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , responsible member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to an Zin@@ ation ca@@ vities , focused decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; an financial crisis in Asia brought forth the F@@ ed to cut its lead to 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limited recognizable impact on growth in the US &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives made these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put on the first place aspects of financial stability , just during a severe crisis such as market collaboration in 2008 , Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee on the interest of interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; recent turbul@@ ence do not come close to this plane , he said . &quot;
&quot; she surely wants to not get into the situation where they are afraid of an Zin@@ ation ca@@ vities , because the markets arose , &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act does not contain the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe they should hur@@ ry the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive at this time in Germany .
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , not without the commitment to an un@@ paid hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
among them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is the body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 lessons they still will be taught .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ ing@@ heim at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is entirely different instruction than at a right school . &quot;
Brazilian Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy sticks
the Brazilian organisation SP@@ RS tried to clarify in sho@@ cking mode women on how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation period is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies give all nutrients that they need to establish a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers seek to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake in order to increase approximately 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only acting adjustment to the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet ru@@ by women actually affects the genes of their babies , and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet for the child can affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new am@@ asses of the sports hall
the council Bern@@ ried approved the construction order for the 2,@@ 3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof is allowed to be used for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ long grain @-@ hor@@ tic@@ ulture at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ ts@@ site come step by step further : in the recent municipal council meeting the struc@@ ted construction order was secured without large discussions .
&quot; previously , the panel had already decided to make a request to an established legal &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid construction plan . &quot;
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form in terms of construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof &quot; &quot; is to be built with non @-@ quality First and bad@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; background of planning is the planned use of the roof for solar systems : &quot; by doing this we get a wonderfully large south @-@ roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; when liberation , it was again around the roof incl@@ ination which is required for clear@@ ing reasons - other than in the construction plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan has no &quot; exceptions to the bad@@ gers - with the am@@ ass@@ ination of the vul@@ ge rule , generally with liber@@ ations sooner or more restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; in turn , however , this is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; we thus create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at costs approximately 2,@@ 3 million euros have been calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from the school and gr@@ ass@@ roots funding .
&quot; in the next process of procedure , the construction order for the 18 x 36 metres wide hall is now presented to the County of the National Council . &quot;
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg will be closed before as planned - namely 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) became new doctor of medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station as well as the majority of the employees are drawn from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this will see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the country district of the district of Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
&quot; however , a decision on the rule of the super@@ visory board , and the t@@ aming on next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to be at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should be moved with fishermen and the further existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the collabor@@ ators , who cannot be offered with S@@ ong@@ au , is said to be offered a work place in Wei@@ l@@ heim , &quot; says Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the staff are informed about the plans .
&quot; triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , the change of cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic and is now connected to a private office in direct proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; at the question who follows the succ@@ ession came , according to Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the direction from 1 October , and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in every case a &quot; &quot; re@@ util@@ isation &quot; &quot; and a bro@@ wning of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; Inn@@ ere medicine &quot; , &quot; said Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
fishermen is a specialist in ab@@ norm@@ alities and defi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inner station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; furthermore , for the next two years , fishermen have to agree with his team if the Super@@ visory Board has to agree on both houses , until then next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ itting , which is still closed over 35 beds , in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , this event had been planned for 2018 if the ongoing refurb@@ ishment is complete at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ump@@ tin Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , who also headed the Chairman of the Super@@ visory Board , resign@@ ed to the house that is owned by the federal government , which is to be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; that close I out . &quot; as it goes with the property , Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White not say , there was several considerations . &quot;
at present there is a spa @-@ care of the Car@@ itas and a day @-@ psychiat@@ rist .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; as fishermen about the Qu@@ asi Moving to the Le@@ ch , which had been received by the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot;
&quot; a genuine perspective for the house , in the fishermen for over 30 years working as a chief doctor , have not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the doctor &apos;s director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened with closing times over the past few decades , for example the surgery and the birth@@ days . &quot;
the palms of all the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are called for tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
&quot; the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal , the clear favorite , the occasion to the pre@@ tension , however , there is none . &quot;
in the last season the bad@@ ener at the B@@ HC is a painful defeat at B@@ HC .
Jag@@ ni@@ sts with two wo@@ unded at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously in@@ ju@@ red during their ma@@ ths afternoon .
&quot; during the Aber@@ nt@@ ens at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in action like the police . &quot;
&quot; after a tug@@ boat , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; how exactly it could come to the accident , at first it was unclear . &quot;
the Cri@@ me police are determined .
mixed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate victims of non@@ violence
a crime committee has led the police to the cor@@ pse that has been mixed up for 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate .
&quot; in the trial of the 20 year @-@ old , the young people were killed and their cor@@ ks were cast into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
one of the most missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate has fallen victim to a victim .
&quot; the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found at the Sunday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a tat@@ too , also on the service of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , which indeed st@@ ems the indication of it and the investig@@ ators brought to the place of suffering . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing in Sunday morning after she did not miss the evening after a visit to a autumn festive in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen as agreed upon .
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first appeared on personal items of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in respon@@ dents in the friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the gener@@ al@@ ysts , they finally revealed a crime against the 20 year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ tensions , the police then led to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found . &quot;
&quot; the ban@@ ez gave the authorities to the police bur@@ r , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the cor@@ pse in the canal was put into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be pre@@ dominant in the Wednesday of the harbour , the investig@@ ators lay tot@@ alling him to the last . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the closer circumstances of action , the further investigation should bring . &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns in front of housing
the situation on the German market market is tense .
there are also more refugees trying to pay a paid deposit .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the hear@@ ings on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing towards a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with income weak citizens around the last paid apartments .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , must be built up to 400,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; in this result , a study on behalf of the association &apos;s connection to &quot; Social housing &quot; is achieved . &quot;
&quot; to compare , this year is finished in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units . &quot;
&quot; therefore , 14@@ 0.000 Apartments have been lacking . &quot;
&quot; refugees are no longer obliged to live after the first three months of their stay , as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial listing . &quot;
&quot; many went on the apartment market , and went into the long p@@ ents in front of the apartment for a long time . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal office , however , in the last year , however , less than half of all the asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing space is not only possible for the increasing refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the construction policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany has an apartment deficit stood before , which is bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; in the metropol@@ itan areas there have already been around 77@@ 0,000 units , with Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many people who have been living in big cities - shared in shared rooms .
young adults remained un@@ optional for the built @-@ in on the apartment market for no longer in the &quot; hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; in large cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined in the last few years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance of &quot; Social housing &quot; proposes a new rest@@ art . &quot;
new incentives are to boost the social housing building .
&quot; thus , it could be disp@@ ens@@ ed on the declaration tax and the basic tax for funded apartments are left @-@ limited . &quot;
&quot; in addition , according to alliance attractive tax @-@ related applications are also necessary . &quot;
the Li@@ f@@ W &apos;s support for Refu@@ ge@@ es K@@ f@@ W is now well attended by towns and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start was at 184 million Euros , already more than half of the currently available approximately 300 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are cor@@ ridor
&quot; practically no more refugees arrive in Hungary , more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the passing on through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
but dangerous is the route but still dangerous .
Croatia wants to engage with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian In@@ minist@@ ries , and if it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
Croatia in Croatia is not a Schengen country .
&quot; after the conclusion of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive in Croatia to reach Western Europe . &quot;
500 people were over the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik &apos;s border @-@ held tran@@ smit@@ ters of RT@@ L .
Hungary also had its border to refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws which entered into force on the same day , asylum seek@@ ers in Hungary almost super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees to happen .
Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; they can go through and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and do something . &quot;
&quot; however , be people who do not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
Croatian police had taken up the first refugees crossing the border to the EU neighbouring Croatia in the morning .
&quot; the majority of the media were reported in Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came by bus as well as tax@@ is to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after your arrival , they would have tried to walk on the green border to Croatia . &quot;
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees were not das@@ hed at the border .
&quot; therefore , the bor@@ rowing and other dangers origin@@ ates : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mines must now create a safe passage .
&quot; according to Hungary , the border of the border can hardly come to refugees . &quot;
on Tuesday there was the police 36@@ 6 asc@@ ending people .
&quot; shortly before the gate on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws to defeat and damage to the Grenz@@ za@@ uns as a criminal off@@ ence .
in the South Hungarian border town Sz@@ eged were therefore 35 criminal proceedings .
the condemned @-@ driven prison sentence has up to five years and the deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the registration office , on Tuesday in the newly constructed &quot; &quot; transit @-@ zones &quot; &quot; on Tuesday in the newly constructed &quot; &quot; transit of 94 asylum orders &quot; , &quot; nearly all - 93 - at the main crossing of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; under the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees had stopped there .
&quot; however , no one has got a chance to get asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; following this view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported .
in front of the &quot; transit @-@ zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to work with it .
&quot; they gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish , which left the tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side . &quot;
pl@@ edges were re @-@ assembled and one of the capture in@@ comes in the border zone has been rebuilt .
&quot; for the purpose of this conversion , no one wanted to speak . &quot;
Austria immediately reached the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country also has its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 immigrants stood still in the country , but still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the way to Germany . &quot;
the train transfer to Germany from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ den@@ ing regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
Mayor drove &quot; Ges@@ tr@@ and@@ ete &quot; over the borders
&quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the au@@ stri@@ pes , when suddenly ten people with travel off@@ springs at the entrance of the tent was standing , &quot; so W@@ ern@@ st@@ one Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; and because Germany had set off the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee dram@@ as , the city bro@@ ker which immediately offered its help and soci@@ ality together with two further hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Pass@@ au River . &quot;
&quot; before , we have tried the un@@ hop@@ ed guests once back , with yo@@ ause and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said immediately , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; such coun@@ ters in the O@@ Ö@@ N meeting . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man let not take it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for fire bri@@ g@@ ades .
&quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; Ham@@ ler &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the Sunday evening at the Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in a regional train to Pass@@ au , to dis@@ sent it after a short notice , that the railway traffic to Germany was dis@@ continued , but still trying to try the border . &quot;
the regional train however was reduced before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border generally highly in the course .
the b@@ quito @-@ firmly association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday are soci@@ able to leave a twin @-@ cycle spor@@ ty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án receives further gyp@@ sy from us now is a logical result of a apparent politics :
&quot; rather than in the warehouse of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke at the moment of the construction of structures to help humanity , our Chancellor continued to be tu@@ ally , and publicly called the position of Hungarian government in the Dun@@ es of National Socialism . &quot;
suffering from this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing in the border regions with chaotic conditions .
&quot; the p@@ oul@@ try will have to find that the &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the in@@ coming winter , in us to create decent states for roads . &quot;
&quot; and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35.@@ 000 winter fixed quarters , &quot;
Konrad has full of doing all hands with the refugee .
Christian Con@@ rad is used to have his word weight .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker to raise lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first start @-@ up centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen did finally get a grip on .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees , which had come to Austria on Monday , was without great ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; Master . &quot;
&quot; the home of the Ministry , however , spoke of a &quot; cr@@ un@@ complex situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; overall , Konrad with a demand for 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ks in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number , you have to find even 35.@@ 000 accommodations in the next weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the ring . &quot;
&quot; should it be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
with the main @-@ li@@ ais@@ ons he has already guided talks .
&quot; these could have secured him , even for the coming refugees to be lod@@ g@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it is good , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born so it should be classified as the church will help .
&quot; great expectations put the asylum coordin@@ ator also into the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; Help how we do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
private people and accommodations can offer their accommodation on the platform .
&quot; in addition , one hopes to see hotels that are empty during the winter . &quot;
Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised yesterday the standards of accommodation as a &quot; very high &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in need of emergen@@ cies , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must have to respect a certain amount of tor@@ to@@ wel @-@ holders or the size of the wa@@ its . &quot;
for a temporary period of time &quot; emergency standards . &quot;
&quot; that he was more successful in contrast to the home of the home , founded by Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am a older gentl@@ eman , which one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause any cost , as they themselves av@@ owed . &quot;
your employees want to increase them by three to four .
the private accommodation was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to put a container by the Steph@@ an@@ splatz ( office ) .
nevertheless there are clearly problems with the permit .
Linz asks for a better distribution
&quot; first , no opening of an urban sports@@ wear and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is currently not necessary , as those who are currently able to do without these measures , says Mayor Klaus L@@ ug@@ er ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , further sites should be checked for emergency purposes . &quot;
critic@@ isms of the city &apos;s Chief of the division of refugees within the Federal Republic of Germany .
other areas must make their contribution here .
&quot; Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst N@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , governor of the European Parliament Josef P@@ lock@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday the further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however there is now the corresponding border controls .
special rates with refugees to Germany will not be there for any more .
however the inv@@ aders were however brought to Germany with regular journeys to Germany .
member states called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue by the other EU member states .
&quot; that now Austria once again leads to its borders to its borders , is for P@@ it@@ inger , &quot; a logical consequence &quot; out of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the reconstruction of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production building , the listed IT @-@ Group S &amp; T Group has moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT the craf@@ ty minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine to invest in start @-@ up companies of the New ship@@ yard and later to update .
&quot; from the beginning an S &amp; T he wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which precip@@ itation promises a lot : &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.1 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T into the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to one third of the City of Linz , the state Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is respected by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meter space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent to give inquiries . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ er opened second shop in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ Hand@@ bags are the centre of attention .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta wanted to set up a dog wide . &quot;
&quot; this project had to put the 49 @-@ year @-@ old In@@ hab@@ itation of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the pig@@ e@@ market @-@ arc@@ ade short @-@ shift : finally , it has now got strength in the shape of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop toward the business , in which it s@@ ells among other po@@ ckets , suitcases , shoes and fabrics of different manufacturers , now it &apos;s all about dam@@ aging the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
&quot; since yesterday , the new shop is in operation . &quot;
&quot; previously , several weeks has been changed . &quot;
&quot; but I have long considered , if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; says wide . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la @-@ producers who are at home from the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags are sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the Only in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion interest has placed wide from her mother in the cradle .
&quot; to me , most when something develops and I can show new trends at reasonable prices . &quot;
why so some woman looks at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag without eating while also the women &apos;s wife can not answer the last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of each out@@ fit is evaluated .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants can be called for .
this property combines man@@ holes also with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for set @-@ off .
&quot; whether it is expressed alien@@ able , journalists , or knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office has brought a vigor@@ ous fight against the election campaign . &quot;
and cuts too well .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ enni@@ al K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate with pride . &quot;
the New Yorker with the family @-@ term is a concept of many in the Win@@ zer@@ ie at the wine road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants village is related to -@@ zig corners with it .
&quot; his grand@@ si@@ re came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del revol@@ ved a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal of becoming a m@@ igh@@ tist man in the world ?
&quot; I think that is somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their bud@@ dy way , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous Spr@@ int , which beside Tru@@ mp also has the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ est@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would surely also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
at the king of his heart he has not brought it there .
&quot; indeed , respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to say that Tru@@ mp &quot; is already a bit a big w@@ alled &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; random the nickname , the sound @-@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - to Hoch@@ German : the Inn@@ er , says it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the offering .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather was emig@@ rated and opened in the USA a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers . &quot;
basic of the property &apos;s property were first property purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from trag@@ e@@ word : their desire to return to back in the home , leading the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Palatinate belonged back then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once written without a permit , he had declared the director of the Institute of pf@@ alz history and folk music , Roland Paul , on the film start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is contrast among the statements made in the after@@ market statements .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the building of a limit poker wall to depri@@ ve illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the pol@@ der , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote relative Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; The gran@@ ny was an un@@ born Tru@@ mp , the op@@ a was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ anced himself . he is always so up@@ lifting .
believes that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; this can I do not imagine , &quot; says the 72 year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the land@@ lady Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as some mess@@ enger , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with a visit something for the church organ has ended , which is generally well anch@@ oring . &quot;
&quot; this can not imagine the Donald of the Donald &apos;s , &quot; said the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they support it better if he does not stand out the choice , because &apos; the latter has such radic@@ als views , I do not know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had been doing the S@@ agen at the time of his grandfather in the USA , would have been as he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ cks Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as a president ?
&quot; my president is not it , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; the grapes are also ri@@ pe with the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; miss movie , which was inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp ( long ) , 12 000 kin@@ d@@ ders have been seen , even in the United States too aw@@ o@@ ken the interest . &quot;
the Ab@@ bay@@ erische municipality Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of vice @-@ pres@@ idents in the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in the National Park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden every Wednesday the award for soft tourism . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ ber villages . &quot;
in the neighboring country the dor@@ sal alpine association is responsible for the award of distinction .
a &quot; mountain village &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of his surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise , domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take the loss of leadership at the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son came to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of leadership in the Liber@@ als , but it has no major shifting among the reviews for today . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was aired by the Bundes@@ capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; ri@@ vals Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Saman@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programs which also belonged to Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage of the resistance seemed to play no part for the Australian TV shows , since Sun@@ rise won an average 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spect@@ ators in the five main cities compared to today today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3.000 ) . &quot;
today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in the last months .
&quot; in August today , today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 4@@ 0.000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now in September Sun@@ rise stands at an average 34@@ 9.@@ 000 spect@@ ators to 3@@ 14.@@ 000 in today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affects these people more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are in order , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently wi@@ ping father , who dis@@ closes with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators . &quot;
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show Solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca ey@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening rep@@ lied with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spect@@ ators , and proposed light The Block ( 8@@ 38.@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;

the last three agreed : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
un@@ covered ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have not kno@@ w@@ ingly manifest who The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was dealt with in biggest secrecy . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows in the day before coming from three two , you possibly acci@@ dentally provided a note that he will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood holds its lips until the final on Thursday sealed .
&quot; all three women have left themselves in ly@@ rical way about why Wood is the perfect man and knew their sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is posed &quot; &quot; If not you , who was the last rose ? &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the player who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood has had an easy relationship with one another from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s energies noted , because I sen@@ sed them that they were quite compatible and I have thought throughout the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on earth ; it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
you feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam has been well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house @-@ visit last week saw her clear that wood &quot; the One can be &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I &apos;m now uncondi@@ tionally adjusted to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , who Wood should choose , if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say this , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a op@@ ted between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor is released on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten . &quot;

&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his rel@@ ocation to the United States - and there were many other teams , which after his impressive open training day have been sent in late last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
some coach had rel@@ eg@@ ated Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank as he lost a lack of angel like it did the Aussie Rug@@ by League con@@ versions on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a multi @-@ unt return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to prove his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of having his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly in its press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ st@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey to forget his ver@@ ph@@ ed mu@@ ang and to take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t in a p@@ unt , restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings &quot;
it was certainly not the start to had hop@@ ed the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian vessel for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he wouldn &apos;t imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was an item that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne disco@@ vers the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut then in 2007 when a pass was conducted in his own in @-@ Go@@ al region to a tr@@ ap for Queensland .

&quot; otherwise , we will get compensation in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the country @-@ attraction of the free voters c@@ eased to Friday in the fran@@ con@@ ian @-@ Comm@@ une .
&quot; actually , all other main topics were included . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; of course the subject of asylum is handed down upon the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of UN @-@ Prot@@ ect for refugees in Syria and as they were during the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; so it is not going on , we must go to the causes , &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the Free voters as fast as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ w@@ anger also called for staff for the administrative courts , who are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum ders , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss is cri@@ tici@@ zed that several states were not working consistently : &quot; &quot; we bre@@ w nation@@ wide nation@@ wide standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot; &quot;

but that goes not far enough through Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we are calling for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that want .

the discussion about the bur@@ dens from the nuclear struggle has pushed the shares of RW@@ E in the meantime on a record deep pushed and also on eon deep trace .
&quot; according to the &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; the German energy chain may not be consumed for 30 billion euros . &quot;
the German government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; as a result , shares of the two largest German energy concerns rose somewhat , but ultimately a little lost ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( eon ) . &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shock @-@ fin on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal when the police picked rubber @-@ stories , which demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out in the district R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , introductory district wife , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters were gathered outside a police station , with some of you stones and fire@@ bom@@ bs . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have started tro@@ ben@@ eng@@ as and then shot in the air before they took back on rubber @-@ fin .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wo@@ unded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the taken rubber @-@ fin , of which is known that they can kill , but traditionally used as less fatal alternative , apparently such high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ as southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi are saying that new provinces , which are formed in the context of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Ret@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , among them 11 police officers , have been attacked in violent struggles since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four big political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled the centuries @-@ hundreds . &quot;

&quot; to our trip included many dark railway and bus trips , equally hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them . &quot;

&quot; but since the refugee crisis and migrants are grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ perate after aid . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing aid for refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;

for easy overweight di@@ abe@@ tics can be more practical .
the benefits of weight loss treatment for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it &apos;s still too early to say whether light overweight people can live with diabetes according to the weight loss surgery longer than those who do not treatments surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial review of the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; loss of weight@@ ing surgery or obesity , use different methods to dimin@@ ish the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have been proven efficient in dealing with type @-@ 2 diabetes , but most of the studies were carried out in people who are overweight with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e . &quot;
you can charge your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng &apos;s General Hospital data that they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity and gast@@ en@@ stro@@ lling - medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes for people who were easily overweight .
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who subjected to this operation , decreased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments nearly equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who subjected to a surgical procedure , proceeds from 36 % to the diabetes disease completely and in 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison , diabetes is completely recycl@@ ed only in one percent and in part only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the results were in the control of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitoring the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c increased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; is refl@@ ecting in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
&quot; the research team also encountered average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass Sur@@ gery Group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.8 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.7 % vs. 2,@@ 1 % ) and directories more a complete surrender of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16,@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study he@@ avier people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , in case of obes@@ e people , it was subjected to obesity intervention , about 29 percent less likely than die in the course of 15 years - compar@@ ing to a group that conven@@ ed with conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not prove to be an advantage for the survival in surgery people , Black@@ stone , it was so@@ othing for individuals with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without compromising the risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors are beginning to take weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 , as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they accum@@ ulate these genetic modification , which have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love @-@ story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is an issue that is inv@@ alu@@ able currently in fiction : a young woman , to school hours un@@ popular and in@@ sight@@ ly , meets the sho@@ al of her youth back after years , and this one fell in love . &quot;
so also in the recently sh@@ allo@@ y novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ r@@ ens readers , as he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot take up all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader insi@@ sted on ending violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of permanent refugee crisis at the start of his ten day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion at Oxford in Eth@@ ic Studies .
he asked that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries was ad@@ owed to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; though the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he empha@@ sized that there is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and realized that the violent response from the US was a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I have expressed my p@@ ity in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the road to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and this has called unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase from in@@ ges@@ tion san@@ iti@@ zer by children in the past 4 years
&quot; tox@@ ics centers in the US report on nearly 400 % minimum increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , the strongly alcoholic san@@ iti@@ zer technology , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , reported the cases of revenues of hand inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years to report the tox@@ ics centers , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more frequently to these products , and unfortunately only a percentage of them go in an emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children inf@@ ect@@ ants un@@ iti@@ zer , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation on social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap adventure .
teenagers have supposedly mixed to ger@@ m inf@@ ect@@ ant with low m@@ outh@@ wash , to get a tough@@ er drink . &quot;
younger children can be lu@@ red by attractive Do@@ wels of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange @-@ du@@ ck , which are very pleas@@ ing for children . &quot;
hand san@@ iti@@ zer is included somewhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol .
especially with to@@ dd@@ lers can already have a few inj@@ ections for the alcohol @-@ det@@ ox@@ i@@ fication .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison Centre at the University of K@@ ansas , the radio Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t have a sip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which was taken recently four sp@@ lash of straw@@ berry in the school , was taken into an emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; your blood @-@ alcoholic centre was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered by an adult law as dr@@ unk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical practitioner , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah cri@@ ed her words and was not able to walk when she arrived in an emergency .
&quot; doctors monitored by night in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of deer @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very fright@@ ening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal to my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers who use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and san@@ iti@@ zer and dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol @-@ ventilation and were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the sw@@ allow of hand@@ de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that enth@@ used a toxic , non @-@ de@@ gr@@ ated ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employee of healthcare authorities implies that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl@@ al@@ co@@ hol , which was noted as the substance . &quot;
&quot; in January of three students of the fourth class in New York , they planned to hide their &quot; &quot; teacher &quot; &quot; by providing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom so there is a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly gra@@ vit@@ ally allergic to res@@ ellers and ex@@ iles them out of their space .
the police viewed the negotiated plan as &quot; Go@@ wit@@ tz &quot; and &quot; trans@@ disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel at pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of the title competition in the Scottish soccer bor@@ edom - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a amb@@ assador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not just about returning the R@@ angers .
you talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there are a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and it is not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
I will rot@@ ate things around , belongs to Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ronn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss is competing . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat of Hun@@ ed@@ oara and the following ex@@ cre@@ tory from the Champions League , the defeat was followed against 10 @-@ man to super@@ sti@@ tions that are now facing the top of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had already bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this exactly as - but we must go on further .
&quot; we really need , really the support from Celtic because that makes the players better . &quot;
killing now is so important .

&quot; in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell to 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ ,000 . &quot;

&quot; I agreed , because I thought it was a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists can be seen in the United States and as often more applicants are available for seats , an mak@@ ab@@ etic lot@@ tery is taking place to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected who will watch it moti@@ on@@ less .
I cannot do that .
&quot; in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps I will sit close to my friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two @-@ half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot if we talk .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and take a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me to aband@@ on my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you will receive access . &quot;
I refer you with her .
&quot; they sp@@ ed that they could have been form@@ ulate better , but they still think that it is wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sip had a problem with some of the things I told and written .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that a international re@@ por@@ ter is present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ por@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I did . &quot;
I will not go here again for all details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
&quot; his actions after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty , to be a beneficiaries of the act . &quot;
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death judge .
I believe that his execution is false .
&quot; and from that perspective I will see him dying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can not claim to be truly objective .
other re@@ por@@ ters will give to which you can turn to this .
&quot; what you get from me is , what it means is to see a man a unnecessary death . &quot;
man after the feu@@ dal police are persu@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale police station is sc@@ ant when he sp@@ ake the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to stop the police was un@@ successful , when he was in sei@@ zed and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few meters from a police officer , the tried , &apos; easy to over@@ speak to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was born on Tuesday to a household her@@ nia in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , this one tried to escape the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I am not coming out , come and get yourself , &quot; said Senior Re@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too keen to make his Uni@@ form wet , so he turned into a reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; a good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people doing funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Re@@ ant Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine . &quot;
Master @-@ soccer player Ben Cou@@ cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , cou@@ sins of his car went in the dit@@ ch to enter a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot;
&quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ cou@@ sins . &quot;
Peter Moody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to sp@@ y him and thre@@ aten him to end the racing sport
Peter Moody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in its st@@ ables in the past year and dro@@ pping the race right away .
&quot; he moved to the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integration section of Racing Victoria and maintained that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last stra@@ w hal@@ m on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what is best suited for racing sport and he did not find himself under difficult conditions than it went to the positive Kob@@ alt @-@ cro@@ fer@@ mentation at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had with@@ held back 18 months because of es@@ pion@@ age se@@ ven@@ ings , and did not want to see it &quot; out like a high resolution of grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had before , nothing to say about it , and I have long been eating out , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything happens at once , &quot; said Moody &apos;s . &quot;
you know that it continues .
&quot; sometimes people are responding to you and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to be tos@@ sed in the head , and I want my owners remember that I try my best to try my best . &quot;
&quot; when they begin to think , I do not , then I should not be any longer coach . &quot;
&quot; I have to think carefully , what I do with my license . &quot;
&quot; previously , Moody the Bom@@ b had to be high in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department did not attempt to sp@@ y his stable . &quot;
&quot; from eight@@ een months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art in a room with a man - whom I will name - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moody on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they clearly believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they have failed to believe me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , President of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ y , acting president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of that time and are still today . &quot;
&quot; should I be able to believe , that it will be personally ? &quot;
&quot; has the RV@@ L behave and is therefore responsible people outside of trainers , which is in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I as bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking there that I am .
&quot; maybe they must take my license and come across me , and I have no doubt that what I say to think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will exercise pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the train@@ ee levels of the trainer will have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody &apos;s best known because of its preparation of the invisible master of Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the rac@@ tags @-@ treatment @-@ treatment &quot; &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been worn on the hor@@ t@@ ends of what against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has dr@@ unken mud on the leg , too . &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday all day as was .
but it also had like that on the race day .
Moody could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation on this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who impose these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules but here you have gone too far , &quot; said Moody &apos;s . &quot;
man by the c@@ urs@@ ed case
in the weekend the police have arrested a man after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent c@@ urs@@ ed acc@@ urs@@ ed in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was supplied with the helic@@ opter into the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries after being hit by a car on the Saturday morning on the Murray Valley motorway .
&quot; the police said , the mot@@ orists continued to stop , without stopping , to help the last driver . &quot;
on Monday there was a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia of the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
it is expected to be charged with the c@@ urs@@ ed and down@@ ward aid and by other traffic damage .

Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ ale fails to fight against Riv@@ ets for alleg@@ ations of alleg@@ ations
Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ ale has critic@@ ised criticism of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; from two Premier League favourites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the Ar@@ bit@@ ters have allowed the Stor@@ m players &apos; Ring race with his team during the high Stor@@ m winners in the qualifying evening in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a barely obsc@@ ured note of the Stor@@ m team , after his team called the final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; pattern game &quot; &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland not &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ me@@ gen defended the stap@@ le of his crew and said that they were &quot; &quot; focused on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ ton said that the criticism of two leading trainers and his team are confident , as they were worried that they were worried about coming from the Stor@@ m team . &quot;
&quot; that emerg@@ es again and again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson via ring fights , than they gave us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ ebo on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed not in our defensive system or techniques across the whole year , but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ tic at a real focus , and that has the trend for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been working there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to lose it , so it was a little shock for him . &quot;
&quot; it is quite funny , as it appears again at this time of the season . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ ebo has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds its ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Ill@@ awar@@ t Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring . &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; says Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed in 2010 St George as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a sh@@ ot@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and we can look as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ball game , which you want to play if you have this kind of player . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben hunt , so that they can play as this . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about us to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think of us when it was around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy pointed out that the game of Stor@@ m against ro@@ sters generated a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is that a s@@ exciting game ? &quot;
or are Pau@@ p to make and do not have any points ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will be able to meet her in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Stor@@ m team has free this weekend since it won the right to receive either North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AMI Park next Saturday , ticket sales starts from the next week tomorrow . &quot;
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ pre@@ matur@@ ation to drug @-@ fixing &quot;
&quot; a man who may possibly have a life @-@ long sentence on account of his experiment , into the possession of 40 kilo@@ grams of Kok@@ ain , which was included in Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 each . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ Stur@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police Force was arrested on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America over V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mili@@ c has been observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the course of the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse , where the police took 40 kilo@@ grams of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially broad penalty for attemp@@ ting to have a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , that it did not give any evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the cafe could have been for a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge on the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the flood of fl@@ ats@@ cre@@ en . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; stated his court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to a criminal case , he put the police about his place of residence . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and st@@ ep@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 Dollar as well as security to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the fi@@ dav@@ it explanations of the two people it is clear that the edition of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Richter fl@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not suff@@ ice , to prevent it from it , not to appear , war@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ zer was released against b@@ ail , among the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian passport , det@@ ects himself daily in the police and get a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile to the sending of pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this slept , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping grove .
it looked through it found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ armed immediately her mother .
&quot; the police took care of this and saw the five pictures , analytical then computer , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; Web @-@ research &quot; , &quot; the search for un@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; then , H@@ og@@ g argu@@ ed towards the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ or@@ ile on the internet &quot; and he then &quot; announced a polic@@ eman to be a polic@@ eman in order to sc@@ are her . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ tin E@@ ili@@ dh Robert@@ son said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said , it would be a addi@@ ction , that he is addi@@ c@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he gave that the searches were carried out on the computer from him , but said it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to be a polic@@ eman to scar@@ c@@ ate pa@@ ed@@ od@@ ile . &quot;
he was asked for his interviews with the in@@ famous person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more pictures .
he said he did so to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he is sick in his head , if he dro@@ wns , and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; once added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the tre@@ m@@ ble and crying . &quot;
she also saw the irregular images on the phone and con@@ front the accused .
&quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said , that the registered computer and play@@ station turned to speak to girls who looked much younger than he . &quot;

the mass makes it : every two years show the high@@ ways at the I@@ AA meet its novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly involved in Komp@@ ak@@ es@@ agen who are currently being sold very well . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations were driven by the Federal Chanc@@ ellery ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( public from 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept @-@ vehicles and new sky@@ scrapers , and luxury cars this year , many new compact models are presented this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the largest Premi@@ ers for the German Autobahn Drive is the Opel Astr@@ a , who will stand at the deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astr@@ a is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the fair . &quot;
he is part of the brand .
&quot; so that the volume model is also well sold , the new Astr@@ a is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is an entry below the biggest competitors VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astr@@ a costs from 16 990 euros .
the Astr@@ a is available with a new 1,@@ 4 l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; also , the H@@ esse feature further diesel and gas@@ oline engines of 70 kW / 95 HP to 147 kW / / 200 b@@ hp , for which for the first time also three cylin@@ ders are included . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astr@@ a is the Opel Astr@@ a initially only as five @-@ fifth . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also already shown on the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astr@@ a on the I@@ AA remaining to new comp@@ actor ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault ma@@ iled the fourth generation of his Astr@@ a competition Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the fair is the Mé@@ ta only as a first @-@ fifth in a conventional and a empha@@ sized sport GT version .
&quot; at the start , he comes the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : quite new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan climb@@ s wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; however , the compact Infin@@ iti is fit with its curved lines fully into the design line of the mark . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol station with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 HP or 125 kW / 170 HP .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celeb@@ rates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model with gas@@ oline engines , including a newly developed 1,0 @-@ Liter @-@ Tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer details in 170 New@@ ton @-@ meters ( Nm ) .
the Bal@@ eno sales start in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the Komp@@ ak@@ t@@ plac@@ emo@@ dell DS 4 , which is shown on the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Abl@@ eg@@ ers placed first hand on the front part : here the cooler was newly drawn and the changed spot@@ light with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons has been reduced by a touch@@ screen and is the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot;

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square meters cell are de@@ un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which was accommod@@ ated for months in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the injury of her human dignity , prisoners have a claim to financial compensation , if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells . &quot;
this is the decision that has adopted the Federal Constitutional Court in an on Wednesday set .
people may then rise to the judges even if they were im@@ pris@@ oned only a few days in the living rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; this was an ex @-@ prisoner with his Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell , between June and November 2009 , in a single cell with approximately five square metres , the toilet was spatial not separate . &quot;
&quot; after that the man , who is now on an open walk according to the specifications of his An@@ wal@@ ts , is now on an open foot in a larger cell . &quot;
his am@@ t@@ sh@@ ism hur@@ ts for the country of Berlin was failing .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court gave the judgment of the Court of Justice in Berlin and the case to renewed examination back there . &quot;
you see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
ci@@ vic Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; although for legal reasons being caused by the frag@@ mented period only a few days of det@@ on@@ days for the compensation are decisive , be a compensation was meant . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a short@@ cut of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot;
the cham@@ bre Court has to clarify the height of the dent@@ al@@ ess damage .
the Constitutional Court have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; they spoke only in April of a prisoner , because he was naked in a cell locked . &quot;
&quot; un@@ worthy , a decision of 2011 is also the multi @-@ specialist of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had issued a prisoner in a parallel in a parall@@ el@@ event in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the se@@ di@@ cal brack@@ et was performed for three months a day , between 15 and 21 hours , in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come to the Head@@ lines in recent weeks as well .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always enclosed in 23 hours that Ag@@ gressive increases , even to bat , it should be due to the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the information of the J@@ iz@@ com@@ press@@ ors , 21 places in T@@ egel were not occupied because of young woman was not occupied , 19 should 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany on ?
&quot; about 800 000 people asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Germany this year , after the statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany is even able to absor@@ b a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated the un@@ common challenge in face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say back and again : we can create that and we can create that . &quot;
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; for different forecasts ranging from 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Finance ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , each year - for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; this is almost twice as much as previously , ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) . &quot;
&quot; dramatically there is the lack of living space but above all for affordable rentals : annually , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments are out of the ten@@ ancy chamber , and in order to apply these particularly favourable residen@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , of currently 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; too little is the result of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing annually , and would have to invest an promotion in the amount of € 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; scientists and Federal Minister expressed in it , that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in the housing building . &quot;
&quot; according to the Institute of labour market research and vocational training , it is to be assumed that 55 percent of the refugee in Germany can be united in Germany in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked regularly after their qualification in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manag@@ erial , for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees is decisive whether they find work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the reception group , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the listen@@ er , says migration researcher Diet@@ rich throne . &quot;
&quot; according to the throne , it was given a political change according to the throne of employment : from the employment ban for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was an employment ban on asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residen@@ cy light , who are asylum seek@@ ers at a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , too , because of the lack of qualified labour , the view has prev@@ ailed , making refugees faster access to the labour market . &quot;
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German .
&quot; until now , there is still no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
&quot; studies also show that jobs most often be convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore in the view of the throne of the King &apos;s path towards the integration integration .
&quot; the Berlin administration has found that only a few refugees were allowed to gather their children in the nur@@ series , estimated ten to 15 percent , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ ack@@ able , spokes@@ person for youth and family members of the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management Hand@@ z@@ ett@@ el distri@@ butes in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for instruc@@ tors rise up strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate will try to increase educational capacities - for example , adding more professional schools . &quot;
in the countries we are prepared for teaching students without a German knowledge of welcome classes .
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also of teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , says Per@@ ate St@@ transpor@@ ting at the Berlin administration department . &quot;
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of the students want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no state asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ associated study - the only exception was so far Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position . &quot;
student refugees might be facilit@@ ated by gaining access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a number of residen@@ ces , or den@@ om@@ inations , do not receive services after the asylum seek@@ ers , when they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter , basically , are not given a BA@@ Fö@@ G , because they do not fall under the circle of hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; for so far , refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 , this sp@@ ying is shorten@@ ed to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but also these financing agreements must be closed , Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will in future play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many that religion is a vital part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually push the same rights to Islam , as they have the churches , and to develop the existing state @-@ Ch@@ urches @-@ right to a new state @-@ religions . &quot;
&quot; important would also be the foundation of a Muslim @-@ welfare association , who professionally takes care of the new@@ s@@ loop . &quot;
among the rights are also duties .
&quot; so , the representatives of Islam should agree on a clear contact partner and willing to work together with the state in many fields and to give him some controls . &quot;
it also belongs to the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chair of the central council of Muslims , As@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts can also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to exit such conflicts in Germany now have their right to leave here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in the future .
&quot; in this way the majority of the majority society will have to change , the break@@ down of discrimination and racism will also change . &quot;
Germany - as a result of European decisions - on a scar@@ ce decade a anti @-@ discrimination question and a general gender equality law .
&quot; but it still lear@@ ns very slowly , how the N@@ SU @-@ folders showed , in which police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist mot@@ if . &quot;
&quot; equal chances for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and stakeholders are calling for a long time to establish international agreements as the anti @-@ racial prevention , must be established in the next few years if the country should remain peaceful and use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to medi@@ ate previously that they have previously been medi@@ cally advised that medical President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , this extra money could flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a bott@@ len@@ ecks , in demand of Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all the com@@ ers immediately shipped to the registration of health types . &quot;
services could later be connected to the federal states later .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people come with the restricted performance catalog to see the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
otherwise we make the doctors in particular to create the language barriers .
&quot; already in so far , the Berlin scientist Th@@ ea Bor@@ de has been proven to be worse about their disease than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in doctors would need to be disp@@ ens@@ ed interpre@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; to help , many refugees would also be helped with more general medical records at the emergency diagnosis . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; under refugee camps , roughly there are significantly more untreated disabilities , and among the young people go to HIV and education . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other medical images , German doctors came from their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to recognise &quot; and what affects the lack of lack , even by the refugees , it is even bur@@ dened in sight . &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly @-@ developed education system ; some refugees were even doctors .
&quot; to practice on practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and should not mar@@ vel the examination once again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees in Germany are caused by estimates of Bund@@ esp@@ Psych@@ otherap@@ ist@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psychological ill : most of them suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic load @-@ load or under depression .
&quot; particularly vulnerable and refugee camp , declare Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by TU München refer@@ enced that every five Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is carrying on a post @-@ traum@@ atic load @-@ depres@@ sive disorder , suff@@ ers among other things at so @-@ called fl@@ backs with respir@@ ation , ver@@ tig@@ o , heart r@@ ases and death . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are sle@@ e@@ - and concentr@@ ations , strong sho@@ cking and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms are chronic , be an early treatment necessary , Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , only four percent of psych@@ ic drugs have been preserved a psych@@ otherap@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; while psych@@ ic sick @-@ looking for asylum seek@@ ers can place an application for psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social welfare , mostly experts or doctors who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases are often decided whether a therapy is required or not . &quot;
&quot; this lead frequently to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites for dre@@ aming
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; the Circus takes on to the traditions of Circus .
&quot; the goal is to attract any age group in the spell of fascinating acts , animal dres@@ sur@@ es and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus circuit in the Man@@ ege on the bricks , was@@ ps to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine without living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie , rehear@@ sal , teacher and juni@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this slogan is the current man@@ ic stage . &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been proven in the hands of the family .
the gift to inspiration is the family therefore in the blood .
&quot; it is important to take away people from their everyday life and take it to a completely different world for two hours , empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year &apos;s juni@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ en@@ cock@@ tail with world city flair , &quot; thus director Reinhard crimin@@ alizes his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 thousand kilometres long tour can experience this air now .
the program of cir@@ cus is convinced by talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo is attrac@@ ting the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family the audience with wit and charm in her spell .
also the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of the sten@@ cils it wants to absor@@ b the Cub@@ an duo .
light@@ ness and mot@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
your hum@@ orous art at the m@@ ast is to conquer the woman in the storm .
except through numerous salmon farm@@ houses the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus are also prob@@ able with fing@@ erti@@ ght and joint unity .

for He Yuan not a problem .
sn@@ ake @-@ humans fascin@@ ate and fright@@ ened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of the ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascinated with their flexibility .
60 representatives from 12 nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of circulation are only too often the subject of different animal rights organisations .
&quot; Stephanie , also takes place : &quot; &quot; we are not looking good for our animals , it also does not go well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every c@@ ursing .
&quot; four @-@ legged g@@ hosts , as they are lovingly called , will be read after every wish from the eyes . &quot;
we want to work together with animals and have fun with them .
&quot; does the animal does not feel at ease , it does not want to go into the ring . &quot;
the first commandment therefore : good for the animals ensure .
&quot; specially on its z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a z@@ ebra @-@ stu@@ ff@@ ed , the family is prob@@ able . &quot;
the two animals have lived in a pen for eight years and nothing is happening .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there &quot; , &quot; says Brigitte , rehear@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; although z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus itself . &quot;
there might be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie , &quot; says whether five or 1 200 spect@@ ators , we always give our best and are with all the heart . &quot;
&quot; the Circus rehear@@ sed , on 17 and 20 September daily at 17 : 00 pm . &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; Thursday is family days , for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe performs the wrong speech in the parliament
&quot; Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down at the beginning of the year by a podium . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also re@@ ed by declar@@ ations of members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous fat@@ alities and they were war@@ ned to accompany the address of Mr Mug@@ abe with Bu@@ hr@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; last month they had been expanded and interrupted for him during his speech to the State of the nation in parliament , this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions @-@ politicians SMS @-@ messages have received on their mobil@@ es , which they war@@ ned to them , Mr. Mug@@ ab@@ es An@@ unci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mug@@ ab@@ es . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the parliament members concerned that the immunity of the parliament ends , and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the leader said that the party of Morgan T@@ sv@@ att@@ ir@@ ai was &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; about the dangers for the politicians . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will be dismant@@ led up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30.000 jobs as part of the restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP will later split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service providers .
&quot; the expected vac@@ an@@ cies lead to a load of over 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , stated on HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , sustainable cost @-@ producing cost for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , which is to be guided by the unit after the separation . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise becomes smaller and more focused than it is HP today and we have a wide and trusted portfolio of shops that support companies at transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual sales and &quot; will be focused on the provision of previously un@@ att@@ acking technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it shares a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s from the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , and its Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; &quot; The birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring running to cope with the turn of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer , and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that tight company focused on a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mate must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger argu@@ ed towards Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September , and provided his rehabilitation according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly be missed at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the big shame associated with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate nu@@ ckl@@ ing injury , and then returned to its old momentum during the pre @-@ season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , which is not good . &quot;
it is not a matter .
this was only an accident .
there was no connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries that he had before .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of further injury , whenever a player attempts to come back in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a pleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd shares 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 from arsen@@ al of 157 lig@@ og@@ lob@@ s in the last five times .
&quot; the broader image for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight games , since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs were to record the most viol@@ in@@ days . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the viol@@ ating rate is going on during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes if you come back from an injury , you have an acci@@ dental time period , a time in which you will gain your body and gain combat force , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body is stabil@@ ised , I am confident that he will do it and he is a career going through the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track on next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents a rotation inside the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to treat a small break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal are clear favor@@ ites , by group F continuing , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is among the slots with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 Games since the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , where on the Rich@@ ard@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 2 were measured . &quot;
&quot; this year , it was the 10th in Zagreb . &quot;
&quot; turning point is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn the teaching of last season with the Champions League capital capit@@ ulation and remains hop@@ ed from far hope , with his management the society lead to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ocal@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never folded in arsen@@ al .
we were very close to 2006 but on the other hand I am long enough in the shop to be realistic .
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even dou@@ bt@@ less than ever before , such as self @-@ suff@@ iciency among young men of a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important death of deaths among men at the age of 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more frequent in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ im ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 than the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to look for aid when they need it . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study on more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depress@@ ants imagined that when the suff@@ erer gave a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere &quot; , his chances of recovery . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of intellec@@ tu@@ ally healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends yet to make a friendship .
&quot; in the age of more social media , with its focus on style about substance , the in@@ centr@@ ation of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strong , life @-@ funny and successful , even if in reality domin@@ ates isolation . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists extr@@ insi@@ sts value ; money , image , social status , everything on cost intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health a lot more profound . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy . &quot;
the Beautiful at Friends was that these focus on the head has been put on its head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which is defined by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers p@@ addle h@@ ugs , moments in the soccer games and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all of this came out of knowing that men can refer to definitely , fully to explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the telephone feed it explained : ... &quot; &quot; my audi@@ ble role for people who are de@@ pressed and self @-@ assisted , has really demonstrated to me how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the males who contact us feel often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; I come to &quot; &quot; expres@@ sing &quot; &quot; expres@@ sing &quot; &quot; expres@@ sing &quot; &quot; an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks of problems openly . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows that come to mind in mind , if I try to export long @-@ term legal mechanisms . &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective out@@ si@@ der status about the phone to look at humans in eye @-@ face of despair also likes that long @-@ term assistance comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so , when you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the part of celebration of the day , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better , if you see sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what difference can make your friendship .

&quot; di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , Malmö to cerem@@ onial &quot;
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Man@@ son Cav@@ ani after his hit to Malmö .
&quot; di Mary meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , to search in Malmö . &quot;
here are the Game Report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and De@@ son Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain asked its Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against mal@@ aria in the prince @-@ stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League Deb@@ t as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion to the way , but afterwards she missed a number of opportunities before they scored a head@@ start when Cav@@ ani recorded a ball@@ ad in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , in the group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only seek the qualification for the seven @-@ end rounds , but rather an improvement on the way to the quar@@ antine in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s missed opportunity in front of the gate . he later started in play against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he started his illustr@@ ating career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or back@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win , to give our opponents problems and look back relaxed , although there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won because I de@@ plor@@ able that we didn &apos;t have some more gates .
&quot; I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his injury to one of three changes to the Paris team , which could hold a 2 : 2 in@@ decisi@@ vely on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was engra@@ ved in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine flu@@ gel@@ ess was born as a man who was able to bring PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , and he pointed out why , when he entered the last month of Manchester United until he went to Johan Wil@@ and past the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big win , that was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off struck to achieve this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle @-@ field opened a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides the shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , which passed far to Kevin Tr@@ p P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave itself to me , with some mis@@ ses and bad conclusions , not least by I@@ bra@@ him@@ al@@ der , who was in the first half of Mary in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed out much more skill to bringing his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ him@@ al@@ den Di Maria in a shooting , which turned out from Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole . &quot;
&quot; the second goal was finally shortly after the hours of the race thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Gover@@ ay@@ er posted its sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ al@@ took a left side fl@@ anks of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all thoughts on that Mal@@ mö@@ s can come back to the game , and just a masterpiece of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before the R@@ e@@ zzi Lav@@ e@@ zzi was a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Hun@@ ed@@ oara , Age Har@@ ased , gave later to that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish League that has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not sufficient . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !
G@@ LEN@@ COR@@ E coll@@ ects 2.5 billion $ by stock @-@ sales
&quot; the mining industry which has been affected in Switzerland , raised by one @-@ stor@@ ing raw material , raised the Wednesday 2.5 billion $ by a stock exchange as part of its huge debt prize package . &quot;
&quot; the Glen@@ core in London registered companies Glen@@ core said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth $ 1.6 billion , in order to rep@@ ay its own debt . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value , fights with falling raw material , since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn has expressed the demand and devast@@ ating itself in markets . &quot;

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and Europ@@ am@@ master X@@ avi playing since summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
&quot; the FC Bayern stood obviously just before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which was back then to FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times Po@@ ck@@ out champion , four times champion @-@ league winner , two times European champion , two times European champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
in summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca betra@@ ys X@@ avi now , that he already stood before the beginning of 2008 before the departure from Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; they told me , that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t say anything . &quot;
and the registered members of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to remember : in summer 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not inter@@ change
the change@@ over did not come about .
and the leading man for this is today working for the German record master : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM .
P@@ EP told me that I would not change the team could not imagine without me .
&quot; so he has conquered me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns Spiel@@ berg 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi would be like .
&quot; X@@ avi was for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ final of the Champions League against the Bavaria about the total distance on the lawn , turned the Red off ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end the king @-@ classes . &quot;

&quot; if we talk about variety , then do it in the occupation of the film and not during the occupation of the show &quot; &quot; assured dam . &quot;
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked with bel@@ e@@ zing un@@ belief and called &quot; hoo ! Wow . okay . &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian .
Dam@@ on and Brown were joining the Produ@@ c@@ enk@@ oll@@ egen Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ mak@@ ly @-@ brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will also be the fil@@ mm@@ aker - how to treat the character of Harmony , &quot; said Brown initially . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a n@@ ut@@ te that is be@@ aten by her white sugar . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People was nominated for the Fin@@ alist Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the director &apos;s rights to the film , &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on provo@@ ke that their director &quot; &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion broad@@ cast@@ ed to explo@@ ded the social media from ab@@ dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on comments .
&quot; Twitter @-@ user Mr Po@@ oni op@@ ted his anger above the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on speaking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain to her variety - that is SO KNOW that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et le@@ aded more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
&quot; men &apos;s comments are at a time when accurate , racial representation is placed in the media at the top of the social discussion . &quot;
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officers , the movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter nation@@ wide has achieved action and regul@@ ators , discrimin@@ atory practices against colour content . &quot;
&quot; in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement , during the introduction of the nom@@ ination albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ ums is For@@ matter , &quot; ( Alb@@ ums still have their meaning ) , he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , the leader of the Movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter will be released as a reaction to the question of the Fox News @-@ personality . Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hat@@ red group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the guides . &quot;
&quot; recently he was announced that Dam@@ on was featured on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ile , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the west . &quot;
&quot; if he accepted the invitation or has already made the Pope , he is unclear . &quot;
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; kr@@ t first champion
&quot; professional ath@@ l@@ ender and the assistance of Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday and took the Grand Prix at a $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which currently completed their 7th season , had never done any competition participant , who managed to complete all the steps of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; on the season , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ ero@@ ann Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , up to the final . &quot;
the climbing skin belongs to a 75 minute walk long climbing track in 30 seconds .
&quot; B@@ ritten had ended the task within the time , which he completed the first Ath@@ l@@ ete , who completed the exhau@@ sting stage 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero gave this challenge full three seconds faster , making it the winner . &quot;
Cal@@ di@@ ero speaking with E ! messages after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand price of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or have my life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his p@@ ile of money . &quot;
so quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading Producer K@@ ent We@@ ed has sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter , to discuss the finals and why B@@ ritten had ended , not to get your prize money at all . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes he receives great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe that he creates a gru@@ dge against him .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
crowds of awards he received by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone , then I am glad it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac could just as felt when they had changed the roles .

Detroit Tig@@ ers pass by Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball today today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a Spo@@ iler , but they played the part in the Tuesday to the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target . &quot;
the T@@ wins proclaimed a chance for Ascension within a season of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League su@@ card square .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F word so hard to believe in a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it arrives , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Indi@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fredo Simon gave his early offensive support , when Detroit beg@@ ged three times into the first two interior , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times to the 1 / 3 inner and enabled three ranks .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw at the bull@@ es of each game , and so I want to go over to the game . &quot;
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ zed tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since the middle of August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since then he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has hon@@ ed the cream well , &quot; said Pre@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the bull@@ ring ) , looked much better at the bull@@ es , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the rear @-@ end , the T@@ wins had her best chance to get back to the game again . &quot;
centre F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton closed the inning with a double on the left @-@ hand field .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a B@@ unt and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced with the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy @-@ ran wall , the only man with whom he was confronted with the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ es ro@@ ok@@ ie Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ ust@@ ed the right @-@ hand Dre@@ w G@@ h@@ agen one two @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the completion of the second , leaving the third b@@ aker Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ling on a double Play . &quot;
&quot; it was the major league for the first time in the season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ps proposed a double Play . &quot;
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inside , a R@@ BI @-@ Double with the C@@ loose of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
the right @-@ handed but S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth night out .
Detroit benef@@ ited as a pr@@ el@@ ude to the game by an even not movable Phil H@@ ugh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers made the three ranks of the first two cour@@ ings against the R@@ igh@@ thand@@ ed veter@@ an , who was cancelled before the game of viol@@ ators , after more than one month after the back of his back . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; said H@@ ugh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt comfortable , when I put and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches out there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ bat@@ ter on the first the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ bat@@ ter , has delivered a single one to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game that managed a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first Run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the Run@@ es in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third bass player Nick Castell@@ anos was followed by a single on the right , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to jump to the third , which the threat ended . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one made a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single by Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
he has not been especially well be@@ aten but he caught the right place .
&quot; H@@ ugh@@ es found himself in a Pit@@ ch Count , did not get any points in the third inning before it was replaced by the rel@@ ic rec@@ tions A.@@ J.@@ Ach@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ ugh@@ es , there came to three R@@ us at six hits and a Walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;

he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who graduated from San@@ chez in 2007 .

Ischgl : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the manager of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Security conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the resol@@ ute reflection on military action should not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he thre@@ w the European states to look out collective .
four years ago it was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce of a military participation in Germany has passed .
&quot; now the conflict was crash in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;

Austria controls up south and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has once again established controls in its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on the Sunday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , to Hungary also no one . &quot;
&quot; also , Germany did not send refugees to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that could take in Germany a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , I have already given a decent ch@@ ill between the General Manager for Public Safety and representatives from Germany . &quot;
concrete numbers were not calling and pointed on talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your goal is usually Germany .
ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann turned up filed together with several other EU heads of state and government a special summit for next week .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; so far , the EU states cannot yet have a common action to proceed in the crisis . &quot;
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new recru@@ it for the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday ( September 22nd ) .
&quot; given the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the states in the initial and distribution of the people . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will join this in cooperation with the countries , and Merkel argu@@ ed for almost four evening discussion with the prime minister in the pit office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ score , those people , the protection bur@@ ies , conf@@ essing this also . &quot;
but who have not allowed any lead @-@ perspective cannot remain in Germany .
this concept was subjected in the round of de@@ pressing .
&quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed , the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge strength @-@ strength &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thousands of des@@ perate refugees have now stuck on the Balkan route . &quot;
Hungary had at night closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on the night .
&quot; within a few hours , the government announced the government in Budapest , but also the border with Romania at a fence . &quot;
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent the tug@@ boats out of Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said to the planned new border au@@ n . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan straight .
there was first det@@ ention of people who had w@@ shed the fence .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther Platz in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of the former President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , there was a more nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill on the name of the German reform@@ ators . &quot;
he is now honoured to portr@@ ay the &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; J@@ ens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded the Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants could live in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority often only in secret their faith . &quot;
&quot; the place is clearly visible in a symbolic manner , that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k to take the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then as a ru@@ it s@@ inner .
his negative impressions are to be supported by historians in his later battle against Rome .
Lu@@ ther then had his th@@ eses against the distr@@ action in the split of the final church .
hammer artists invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar has painted old for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written and updated the introduction of Bible writers .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the image for Ot@@ mar Old , who has formulated over 150 moti@@ fs his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the individual themes , this may quite be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years Ot@@ mar has worked old to his Bible project , for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many theme areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are cycles , which devote themselves topics such as cru@@ ising , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds , or f@@ ather@@ land . &quot;
&quot; with this , he has spont@@ aneously fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther publisher with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on artificial books . &quot;
and here is the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost which has focuss@@ ed on the basis of painting with the corresponding Bible places .
&quot; he interpreted the Bible by the Ot@@ mar of the selected Bible and thus into the present wave , into current inter@@ relations . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible meeting of Martin Lu@@ ther , and each one of the artist , who wrote his very personal thoughts on the situation here . &quot;
the jewelry @-@ belt has golden letters .
&quot; so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old is almost twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately born in general for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Old , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who listened to the strict Protest@@ ant ruler . &quot;
&quot; and the education was already done with the tube , &quot; &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Old . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work out to work with the Lord dad , perhaps even again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help art in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is now shaped by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being pushed .
artists have another desire and t@@ onne to show things .
images have always something mysti@@ cal and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Old wants to let the observer in the pictures &apos; catch them , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , and on Tuesday at the launch of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; has always been &quot; an lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art &quot; &quot; like he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not take care to grasp the Bible fully , but that is for him important , also mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not co @-@ operation on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; it was a pictures from the Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler , from Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen wall pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction on BM@@ X rail@@ ways
&quot; plans made to place space , company ori@@ enting , wel@@ ders for a tour model : one year later it was almost all finished - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and management care for compar@@ ing , especially with the residents who did not toler@@ ate the train . &quot;
&quot; so hills overlooking , new place was sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
the permit will come in October to share the First In@@ der@@ ci@@ on Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; I hope that this year is even more visible , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it was then without &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; to be started with working at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga is pushing a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football respon@@ ds to the present situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its aid to the challenges of tackling the upcoming problems .
&quot; I consider that the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ union .
&quot; nobody can say in principle , that goes nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; that has to be interesting to everyone , this subject must get a handle on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
he deals with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin for the annual meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and tre@@ k there the head of Minister Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; then the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ around must be the policy .
the German soccer team has therefore expanded its refugee &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program runs through 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some Bundes@@ liga support this program too .
&quot; already on this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ eine ensures a clear sign , if they are on the left of Tri@@ kot@@ poor@@ er instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that all of us should help , where and how they can , &quot; &quot; said Lever@@ int Sport@@ Chief Rud@@ i V@@ ö@@ ller of the &quot; Image &quot; -@@ Newspaper ( Tuesday ) and distinguished the project as &quot; self @-@ comprehen@@ sibility . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this wave @-@ drama goes every thing , no one is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we can have soccer team , no , we have to use our radiation , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so unbeliev@@ ably , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ eg@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter S@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
&quot; for EM @-@ qualification round against Hungary at this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes the support of refugees as &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot;
&quot; that every 36 license must have launched its own projects , be great . &quot;
&quot; just as great , that small and smallest associations are there . &quot;
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; which we have spent , will be lived in football . &quot;
&quot; that is of huge importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , the association is presenting together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government in each case 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the associations have also already called off the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Pre@@ j@@ ent loses eye with an eye on accident
&quot; the leadership of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has stated several reports according to a fall in early July the left eye . &quot;
&quot; with the accident at the stair@@ way in the house of his brother in the US , he was after midnight on a water th@@ rush , which he carried on the left hand reports the &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bl@@ eeding , was impot@@ ent , has then stepped out on the road - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; c@@ ites the &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder H@@ asso . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go down his work .
&quot; in early October we meet before the Super@@ visory council meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Pre@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; fully unemployed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday announcement ) in October . he will come back to Germany in October and continue to keep the software packages .
&quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I got the whole time in regular contact with the Super@@ visory Board and its president H@@ asso , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA since last summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; to him it is important to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; every thing can happen . &quot;
&quot; important is to get up again , if you like it . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot magn@@ ets apart from skir@@ m@@ ish ...
&quot; Magn@@ ets t@@ wit@@ ter@@ te a corresponding photo and explained , he suffered the injury , when he over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
&quot; he therefore comes a little as a reserve in Singapore at the weekend as a reserve for the two families , Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us vs Kras@@ no@@ dar : white dish in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes of a com@@ eback can finally be struck by Marco Re@@ us , in the first group game of the Europa League . &quot;
the national player is missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as the Du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7@@ pm / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether you will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ top@@ game against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach is open again : &quot; we expect to return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will change its gene@@ alog@@ ger not only on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door @-@ ke@@ eper position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ ft@@ eller takes the place of tri@@ ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he is doing on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the World Teacher . &quot;
&quot; however , past@@ ure in the future comes in all the Europe @-@ league games , however , Tu@@ ch@@ el left . &quot;
with a high degree of probability he will share the second participation .
&quot; the for@@ ge statement from fellow @-@ players Re@@ us , that the Fin@@ alist statement for the BV@@ B in the Europe League will be the goal to comprehend mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; &quot; that Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : the government wants the leading role in Germany
&quot; Germany shall be fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner , according to the will of the Federal Government on the change of the car of technological pioneer . &quot;
&quot; the cabinet decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ir from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which provides investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ echanika I@@ AA from a &quot; &quot; new mobility Age &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated , connected and connected driving will increase traffic safety and worry for less cutting , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states who also come together with representatives of the industry .
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ir of the Ministry of Transport offers among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band @-@ building and in @-@ depth turnover on digital radio .
&quot; currently , the testing of new technology is currently developing a test circuit at the highway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver &quot; &quot; no additional operational risks , &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to examine the legal conditions &quot; , &quot; where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to use the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles of 10 to 130 hours / hour . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government is also intended to establish a change in the Vienna Convention , so far only to see the people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; at Autom@@ ated driving , the car increases the guidance , the driver gets more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras , which capture the surroundings and process the data within seconds . &quot;
&quot; following one of the studies submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways to 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the useless vehicles on public roads seems to be expected very far back by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; the value @-@ added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany location estimate the authors of the study for 2025 to approximately 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ per@@ fi@@ ya S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
the question of liability in cases of accidents and the security of personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars can still be skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA forward survey of the For@@ sa institute on behalf of the Test @-@ Institut Dek@@ ra gives the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that self @-@ educ@@ ating cars will compete in the next ten years , including 31 percent do not believe in it , 31 percent do not believe in it . &quot;
&quot; in France 21 per cent of the respon@@ dents by 2025 associated with aut@@ on@@ ome cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to fully rely on a self @-@ driving vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey of the Bit@@ k@@ om &apos;s Bit@@ k@@ om , only seven percent would agree to complete control throughout the trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , they could think about 15 percent in flowing intercourse at least 15 per cent , in the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , every Fourth would leave the car to control under no circumstances . &quot;
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at Tis@@ no tennis @-@ EM ab
&quot; the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer plans to stand up for the cover , from 25 September to 4 October only in the single . &quot;
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys enjoyed it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without a Timo the title , &quot; &quot; said Bundes@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ Teacher in Düsseldorf . &quot;
B@@ oll has been on the flight at that time on the flight to an agreed upon sponsorship of sponsorship in China .
the 34 years old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are now no longer as a clear favorite , &quot; stated single European carrier Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ ist in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also to the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we became the European master . &quot;
&quot; in this way we should ori@@ ent@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; declared the world calendar . &quot;
the English football @-@ team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has moved a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for a du@@ f@@ ant
&quot; it is a blend of a very large fashion show , and a wak@@ ening @-@ smile @-@ label : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich . &quot;
&quot; high@@ points : window man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which will be sc@@ af@@ ening thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as St@@ nen@@ out@@ fits to the big star of the mo@@ dem - and with it that he put men into the tube . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant , of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was broken , now it is genuine , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 , at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a luck that the mo@@ des@@ pot@@ ters has changed his early attitude towards a show over his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been on the other hand , for : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit to death &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , you get into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dres@@ ses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ whose . &quot;
&quot; it is part of tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the hard work of the man , the fashion history has written without ever having an education . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it is an excellent chore@@ o@@ graph overall artwork , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ ying the doll@@ s , for example it &apos;s a sty@@ list . &quot;
14 tonnes of material die the creators according to the Board of the cur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the October Court there was still a special treat : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen @-@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ essor old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ated fashion , the design of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy b@@ HS and clothing , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing a d@@ oll , his parents would not allowed him to be allowed . &quot;
the horror of fashion was brought to himself later on .
&quot; he st@@ ole the fashion journals , and saw the dr@@ afts of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
but later I bought that .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the Models .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the gear . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
earlier it went to the long stit@@ ching machines in and around ch@@ ew@@ ing about it meters .
&quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and points emerged in large quantities for clients , which include them for blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains , managing director of the Mo@@ desp@@ ise Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , the fashion is very important . &quot;
&quot; during the initial times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a bigger role , was then pus@@ hes through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as an niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : top in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional train@@ e@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called Vintage mode , which borro@@ wed himself to past j@@ le@@ aks , an increasing level of order . &quot;
those who are not serving in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
for us they are already half of all orders .

&quot; in the last 15 years , roughly 80 percent of its sales have been achieved . &quot;
&quot; private specialist stores and also the wholesale , there are almost no more . &quot;
our products are hard to reach the customer on this road .
the mass goods is produced much cheaper today in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold via chains .
&quot; weak@@ ening the export , up to Russia and the USA . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to score by environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer was explained by the nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we introduce a quality seal , which shows that we are environmentally and socially responsible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt complements : &quot; this also applies to the used materials . &quot;
&quot; Master design@@ er U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger University Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; to continue the competition from the Asian region , you must find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; it arises a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies , who must think in particular economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a existing design can often only varies , to maintain a customer base . &quot;

&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and want to have a reminder . &quot;

XI pus@@ hes growing the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy has to open up wider public to further growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping has been commissioned on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should use this to improve foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a discussion at the 16th session of the central leadership group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms , bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , Xi . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation , border controls policies , promoting government enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the citizens . &quot;
&quot; according to statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified for investments do not come into question . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because it demonstrates the market a major role in creating resources , a legally public business environment and designed the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also control controls via the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how they perform their business .
&quot; statement also stated that China border regions will allow , new models of cross @-@ border business cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; as part of an offer , public controlled sectors will open , more areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will safeguard the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed enterprises and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; to be facilit@@ ated by the requirements and the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right to prosec@@ ut@@ ors to guarantee their activity , and advocate professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;

EU wants to double mer@@ cury in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mer@@ cury in large rob@@ bery and the consumers therefore significantly higher dose of the nerve y@@ ields .
&quot; the consumer organization Food@@ watch , which is a corresponding work@@ book of the EU , cri@@ tici@@ zed the plans : &quot; &quot; risks and side @-@ effects of fail@@ ingly industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full weight of pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; declared Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt by Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , say the threshold values of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ing for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; from one on two milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury each kil@@ og@@ ram of fish . &quot;
&quot; but large rob@@ bery @-@ fish have already been ham@@ bur@@ dened so strong with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the still existing limit values are not sold at around 50 percent of the length . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be effective . &quot;
&quot; in return for this attrac@@ ting , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy the bor@@ den@@ ies on other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram tr@@ ap@@ sil@@ ber per kil@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ watch described this but as a &quot; trick &quot; , &quot; because small fish @-@ fish , such as carp , are usually so low ... that they already keep the planned maximum levels already today . &quot;
&quot; the sin@@ king of cl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; an per@@ fi@@ der distr@@ ust , which will help the economy alone , &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
Mer@@ cury is a non @-@ toxic heavy metals that strongly influenced across the food chain in front of pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; the German government for@@ war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; already small amounts , especially in the inf@@ uses of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment , as regards its own homepage with regard to the current top values , however , that a &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard &quot; &quot; cannot be expected . &quot;
Mer@@ cury is above all due to the consistency in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information by the Bundes@@ minist@@ ries to the Green Par@@ alia , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish in roughly in El@@ be , Rhein and River Danube is &quot; permanently over@@ stepped &quot; , &quot; had the &quot; mirror &quot; in March out of paper . &quot;
