special surveys will be given in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
&quot; amounts to pay this prayer are directly to the organisation , which they reserve . &quot;
&quot; every special loan is provided by a separate loan agreement between the benefici@@ aries and the stew@@ ard , in which especially the origin of the funds is given . &quot;
&quot; the revenue from any special loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the benefici@@ aries or for goods or services that are manufactured b@@ z@@ w . ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization are determined and by the basis of what the car@@ et@@ aker may be defined at the time of the loan granted , recipient of a special response . &quot;
&quot; capital deposits of special duties are provided on the special agreement account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is back as soon as possible by stew@@ ard to the Member State in the Member State . &quot;
the administrator has taught the EEC and the EEC relating to the testing by the directors in preparation and about the directors approved by the directors .
&quot; during the time the payout of the Offer is taught the EEC quar@@ terly annually on the development of the special applications , and the expenses for these issues . &quot;
the administrator submitted to the EEC as soon as possible after conclusion of the business year of the organization a detailed accounting of the special calcul@@ ator with an opinion of the external calcul@@ ator of the organization at this conclusion .
&quot; following the full payment of the Offer loan , the EEC submitted to the EEC to be sent to a detailed report on the projects financed by the special agreement . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and guides suitable records and securities , from which the contributions to the special account resulting from the account received and from the account paid amounts and withdraw@@ als to the Member States are visible . &quot;
the EEC and the stew@@ ard work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to do this , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the stew@@ ard up to the full issue of the special response account of time to time a thought exchange about the state of the special agreement , the progress of the provisions relating to special programs or plans and about any other questions that affect the provisions of this agreement . &quot;

&quot; the total quantity of Greece has been set up with the day of accession to the Community to 23 000 tons of battle body weight . &quot;
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine Ham@@ mel - and fl@@ amm@@ ite on the community market within the agreed amounts .
&quot; in particular , the community involves precau@@ tions , in order that the sales volumes of interven@@ tion@@ ists on frozen meat due to the implementation of the Regulation shall not under@@ mines the paragraph of Argent@@ ine Ham@@ mel and lam@@ b . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of refund or other funding measures for the discharge from Ham@@ mel - and lam@@ bs only at prices and conditions , which are in accordance with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community trading in these products . &quot;

&quot; the committee is concerned with this agreement that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b - and goat meat under the agreement are not executed according to the community . &quot;
the committee discussed all the relevant solutions during the implementation of this agreement and recommends the relevant authorities appropriate solutions .
