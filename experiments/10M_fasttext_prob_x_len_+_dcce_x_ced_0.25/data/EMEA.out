&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ur@@ inary Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the committee has assessed for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please refer to your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific debate ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets that can be dis@@ solved in the mouth ) , as a solution to the one ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection @-@ solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ es thinking and Spe@@ aking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or sight of things which are not present ) , distr@@ ust and mani@@ pulation ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , a mental illness , in which the patient man@@ ic episodes ( periods of ab@@ normal mood ) will altern@@ ate with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe until severe Man@@ ic episodes , and to the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past . &quot;
injection @-@ solution will be used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution to the one or the mel@@ ting dra@@ ins can be applied in patients , those that are prepared from tablets trouble . &quot;
&quot; patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are exactly as A@@ bili@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , i.e. chemical substances which allow communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is thought to be mainly known as &quot; parti@@ te ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also ser@@ otonin is called ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in low dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter affects the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , it contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re@@ occur will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , the re@@ emergence of symptoms , has been studied in three trials over up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of injection @-@ solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or similar disorders that compared to increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was stabil@@ ised over twelve weeks on 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ plac@@ ebo , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo that have been stabil@@ ised to 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabil@@ ised with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection @-@ solution was taken in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that compared to increased un@@ rest ( an other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients with a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients being examined for the treatment . &quot;
the company also led studies by exam@@ ining how the body res@@ ides the mel@@ ting dra@@ ins and the solution to initi@@ ate ( dis@@ rup@@ ting ) .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection @-@ solution showed patients , the A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significant stronger reduction in symptoms increased un@@ rest as patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder decreased A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks long , more effective than plac@@ ebo the re@@ emergence of recur@@ ring episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administ@@ ered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg @-@ cans also decreased more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to capture ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ Pyram@@ id@@ ale interference ( un@@ controll@@ able ) , breaking , nau@@ sea ( so@@ jour@@ n ) , fatigue , nau@@ sea ( burning ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the committee on human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) have led to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia , as well as in prevention of a new man@@ ical episode in patients who reported mostly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes have to address with Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee also came to the result that the benefits of injection @-@ solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable to outw@@ ei@@ gh the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission shared the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar episode and for prevention of a new man@@ ical episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l languages ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended initial dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day independently of the meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in doses of a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
the recommended initial dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily ; regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients &gt; 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient population , a lower initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is set out from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the appearance of su@@ ic@@ idal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective distur@@ b@@ ances and has been reported in some cases after the start or a change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy in some cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
the results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder does not have raised in@@ efficiency risk with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic diseases , path@@ ogen@@ ic diseases , path@@ ogen@@ ic diseases , treatments which are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which was one year or less lasting , there were occasional reports of during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l ascen@@ ding dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if with an AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient signs and symptoms develops on a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic medication must be cancelled , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l should be applied to patients with c@@ amp@@ il@@ ations in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states that are related to c@@ amp@@ il@@ ations , with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ osis which were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , an increased mortality rate compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and the infection for unwanted zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in with Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients suffering with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related events involving AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents of patients to release the direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ mer@@ y , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in regards to a deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , where weight is known as secondary effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with itself over@@ bearing side effects such as navigation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically @-@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and that &apos;s why similar Dos@@ age reductions will be made . &quot;
&quot; at CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abol@@ ism can result in common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher Plas@@ mak@@ es@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ abol@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common gift from K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ prot@@ eas@@ ers , seem to have similar effects and therefore similar Dos@@ age reductions should be made . &quot;
after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors the dosage should be raised by AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y to the tin @-@ level before the beginning of the companion therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is administ@@ ered together with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y can be expected with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical trials showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l per day no significant effect on the sub@@ abol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ Rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be out to notify their physician when they get pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole planning .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the concerns in the animal studies at the animal may not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits are justified clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , even with other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication the patients should be for@@ ew@@ ar@@ ned to operate dangerous machines , including power vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 ) on as under plac@@ ebo or were considered as possible medi@@ cally relevant effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the down@@ side effects is defined after the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , treated with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ zo@@ l , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with nec@@ kl@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.4 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks in the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients below Ar@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % in patients , which were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ ger@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients below Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under the Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients below Ar@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium treatment .
in the long @-@ term study phase over 26 weeks at a plac@@ ebo controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treatment patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient &apos;s groups under Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ating controlled laboratory parameters appeared , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , treated at 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l treated patients compared to 2.9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; to the side @-@ effects that can occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their occurrence also includes during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ zo@@ l , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality among older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the launch of the market , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ do@@ ings with Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l has been observed alone with adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; while there is no information on the effectiveness of an excessive analysis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely to use hem@@ i@@ aly@@ sis in treating a over@@ dose of benefits , since Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l has a high plas@@ ma @-@ binding . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is convey@@ ed with the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l showed a high affin@@ ity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ or and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ or , as well as an excessive affin@@ ity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 hr@@ ine and for hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ rec@@ ept@@ or . &quot;
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers presented a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction in the bond between 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 recept@@ or Lig@@ anden , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the coup . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole compared to plac@@ ebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 is the share of the Res@@ p@@ onder patients who joined forces in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values in measuring range , which were defined as secondary study , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at nec@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia , a significantly higher reduction of the back rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ ger@@ d controlled , multi @-@ blind study with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia , about 26 weeks , the 314 patients embr@@ aced and in which the primary study of &apos; weight gain &apos; was reduced by at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.5 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l a opposite plac@@ ebo superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo controlled monthly study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l compared to plac@@ ebo no superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and actively @-@ controlled monthly trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , showed Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l a opposite plac@@ ebo superior effect in week 3 and a maintenance @-@ effect that was comparable with that of li@@ thium or semi @-@ cler@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l also pointed out a compar@@ ative proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ is@@ sion , on such as li@@ thium or semi @-@ gener@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar@@ isation disorder , with or without mental characteristics that partly spoke about 2 weeks not on li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy on therapeutic supplements , in comparison to mon@@ otherapy with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo controlled study over 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who have achieved with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on plac@@ ebo over plac@@ ebo with regard to prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in prevention of a retreat into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on vit@@ ro @-@ studies , the enzy@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ y@@ dri@@ lls and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ation is cat@@ aly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the middle elim@@ inations period lies at approxim@@ ate 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ zo@@ l on CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and with nearly 146 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ abol@@ ishing on CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; with Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ euticals between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia , there were no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a non @-@ specific analysis of Phar@@ mak@@ ine@@ tic has no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ lor@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose of trial with dis@@ agreements with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to pull the conclusions on their metabo@@ lic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies for security sp@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeat@@ ability , reproduction , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the pre@@ clinical data provided no special dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ological significant effects have only been observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have only limited or no significance for the clinical use . &quot;
the effects ru@@ mp a dos@@ ed @-@ dependent anc@@ ill@@ in @-@ tox@@ icity ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg ( equivalent to 10@@ mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10@@ mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ mg of the Middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ Ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis in humans ) .
furthermore a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been found as a result of the exclusion of sul@@ ph@@ ate counter @-@ ju@@ g@@ ades from Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle from monkey to repeat@@ ed@@ l @-@ State @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis with people based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; however , in the human G@@ alle with the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentration of the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ z Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l were found no more than 6 % of the concentr@@ ations that were found in the study of 39 weeks in the G@@ alle by Mon@@ keys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; with rab@@ bits these effects have been observed according to dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11@@ times the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C with the recommended clinical max@@ al@@ d@@ osis . &quot;

the recommended initial dose for Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day independently of the meals .
&quot; patients , who have trouble passing from AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y tablets , can take the mel@@ ting tablets alternatively to AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y tablets ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe simil@@ arity , a similar effectiveness in terms of population has been observed , but a statistical Sig@@ ni@@ fe@@ z could be determined on account of a decreased patient population . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) compared to plac@@ ebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study , on the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters were received earlier a anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ ways or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; in total , published in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , the conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el received in the treatment . &quot;
&quot; considering the patients being treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference in medicines to deterioration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients showed themselves with patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators , that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el in the medicine . &quot;
&quot; it may also be used in patients , breast@@ feeding , or before the treatment of low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phy in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the committee on human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients , with which the first treatment was no more effective , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el in drugs do not have to be given in other medicines to reduce any side effects . &quot;
&quot; January 2008 , the European Commission consul@@ ted as a Bios@@ cience Limited as a permit for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indi@@ ces for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ adi@@ c in patients , in which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is not displayed ( see also section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; male patients should be advised in the treatment of a sperm renovation , since therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility . &quot;
abra@@ sion may cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very frequent ) and ver@@ tig@@ o ( common ) which can affect the traffic @-@ resistance and ability to serve machines .
&quot; below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects listed at 229 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mal@@ zin@@ oma , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 . &quot;
ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ y ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported at 71 % of patients .

Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ym@@ ub@@ uli that promotes the con@@ vic@@ ting of mic@@ rot@@ ules from the Tub@@ ular In@@ dies and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules of its Dep@@ ol@@ isation .
&quot; this stabil@@ isation leads to a inhi@@ bit of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network , which is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ ium conv@@ eys the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of Plas@@ mak@@ om@@ pon@@ ers in the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells and as part of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies has proved that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in is transported to the transport of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ som hel@@ ical transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ ept@@ or and due to the alb@@ ume Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( well @-@ coated protein @-@ rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) appears a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of tum@@ ors .
&quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ mal@@ zin@@ oma is treated with data from 106 patients in two infected studies and by 4@@ 54 patients , treated in a random@@ ized Phase III @-@ compar@@ ative study . &quot;
&quot; in one study 43 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mal@@ zin@@ oma were treated with b@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 is used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mal@@ cin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was conducted in patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ es@@ cin@@ oma , either in the form of sol@@ uble Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion to prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without a label ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of the patients had a han@@ dic@@ apped general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ ale met@@ ast@@ es and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ ed cells . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received any chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adjuv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ ast@@ o@@ dating and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ o@@ dating and adjuv@@ ant treatment . &quot;

&quot; 10 After intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic Mam@@ mal@@ zin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation took off in a multi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic way . &quot;
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching ex@@ travag@@ ant distribution and / or soft delivery of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study with patients with advanced solid tumor , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 175 mg / m2 sol@@ vent @-@ free Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el compared . &quot;
&quot; the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher according to the Abra@@ x@@ ane met@@ am@@ el ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ containing Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was over x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human liver micro@@ some and threads is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily associated with 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) metabo@@ li@@ zed .

&quot; treatment with se@@ amed must be accompanied under the supervision of a physician , the experience used in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the drug is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make self @-@ blood vessels , Ab@@ se@@ amed is in a V@@ ene to inj@@ ected . &quot;
inj@@ ections can also be made by the patient or his super@@ visor unless they have received adequate guidance .
&quot; patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency or patients that receive chemotherapy should always be recommended in an recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per cap@@ il@@ iter with adults or between 9,@@ 5 and 11 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to control before the treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administ@@ ered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney disease , an an@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or so that the body is not sufficiently related to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied mainly operations to increase the number of red blood cells and hence the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that has been incorporated into a gene ( DNA ) that it adap@@ ters to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a V@@ ene in the frame of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients , caused by kidney problems caused by ren@@ al problems , with the reference agent . &quot;
&quot; all patients participating in this study had been revers@@ ed at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , before they were asked either on se@@ amed or further E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ s between the beginning of the study and the distribution period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin stre@@ amed se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer victims were received .
&quot; in the study with patients suffering caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ ost@@ glo@@ bin@@ ders of patients were maintained on ab@@ se@@ amed , as with those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients showed that E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the starting point of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of a enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ech@@ end mig@@ rations and confusion . &quot;
&quot; se@@ amed should not be applied to patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; se@@ amed as inj@@ ections below the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) came to conclude that for Ab@@ se@@ amed has been provided according to the provisions of the European Union of evidence , that the drug shows a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , producing Ab@@ se@@ amed is provided for medical staff in all member states information packages , including information about the security of the drug . &quot;

controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit to which indicates the gift of epo@@ xy can be attributed to the genes of epo@@ xy symptoms that increase concentration of anti @-@ blood symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ mer@@ gers required .
the hem@@ orrho@@ land@@ rose should be about 1 g / dl ( plac@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ ary coron@@ ary heart disease or storage in@@ suff@@ iciency should not be exceeded at Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of the hem@@ ost@@ asis area .
&quot; following the present knowledge , by the treatment of an@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency , that are not yet di@@ aly@@ tic , the progression of kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency is not accelerated . &quot;
in tum@@ our patients under chemotherapy should be considered for the assessment of the therapy cost of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response ( patients that may be trans@@ forming ) .
if the H@@ B increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ B value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ic an@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustment with the aim to keep the hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ gen between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
&quot; the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on the benefit risk of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure should , if possible , prior to the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia is examined and appropri@@ ated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who are under@@ going to under@@ go a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery , as they should have an increased risk of thro@@ pods and vas@@ cular diseases , especially with a fundamental cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting point of care &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post@@ operative illness / vas@@ cular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ xy not proved that they can better survive with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were given an chemotherapy reg@@ ained if a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target @-@ concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) has been pursued . &quot;

the most common side @-@ effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependence of blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of cardiovascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; independently of the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular ab@@ norm@@ alities after repeated blood@@ shed and vas@@ cular complications . &quot;

the survival and tum@@ ors were examined in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double blind @-@ re@@ bound studies and
in the open study there was no difference in the overall survival between the patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etic patients to patients and the patients .

overall survival in the studies could not be described by differences in the incidence of th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications in combination with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etic patients treated patients and in control .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ ws of tum@@ ours in tum@@ ours that are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be excluded .
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are treated to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tum@@ ours , treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a hem@@ orrho@@ id under 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the transferred data . &quot;

&quot; for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta should only be prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta the same is as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , almost 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of sp@@ ine and hips has been examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study embr@@ aced 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis more than 50 years , which had recently suffered a gir@@ affe ; it was examined the number of frames over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bite ) . &quot;
main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the sal@@ ary of the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase in the Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me , the bone substance ) in the blood decreases normal or by at least 75 % compared to the cur@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of sp@@ ine textures under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) has been reduced over a period of three years compared to the patients below plac@@ ebo by 70 % . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis , with those among plac@@ ebo the risk of hips has been reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip ac@@ upuncture , 9 % of patients suffer from A@@ cl@@ asta a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients on plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta so@@ cks within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in repeti@@ tive inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta must not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against zinc @-@ acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or one of the other components .
&quot; as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients are subject to patients with A@@ cl@@ asta the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the inf@@ usion set and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( mar@@ g@@ ments of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta makes up @-@ up material for doctors ready to prescri@@ be the A@@ cl@@ asta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis who explains how the drug is used , as well as similar material for patients with which the side effects of the drug is explained and pointed out when they should consult the doctor . &quot;

clinical evaluation by the treating doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and be based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of as serious side @-@ effect reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bers was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who were plac@@ ebo ( 0.7 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ ve Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the total prevalence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.8 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.8 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) of unwanted drug effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney metabolism Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function , which is expressed as decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um credit ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure . &quot;
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( per year before the administration were measured ) and the appearance of kidney function as well as a restricted ren@@ al function were compared to oste@@ opor@@ osis for over three years comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 percent of patients infected with A@@ cl@@ asta patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the Labor@@ be@@ f@@ unde , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were treated below the normal oscill@@ ator ( less than decre@@ asing m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , in a large clinical trial treated patients compared to 21 % of the patients with A@@ cl@@ asta into the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et @-@ studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures , after a recent example , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in a large clinical trial was reported via local reactions to the inf@@ usion set , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;

clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 ) with either a bone mineral density or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ score for the shaft as &lt; -@@ 2.5 with or without sign of an existing sp@@ ine .
effects on morph@@ ometric sp@@ ine A@@ cl@@ asta lo@@ wered significantly over a period of three years as well as after a year the frequency of one or more new sp@@ ine cells ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients from 75 years and older had a total of 60 % reduced risk to sp@@ inal body compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 0001 ) .
effects on hips A@@ cl@@ asta reported a equal effect over three years on which resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI ) 17 % up to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip re@@ frac@@ tures .
&quot; bone effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta raised the bone density at the steering r@@ acqu@@ ic acid , hip and at dist@@ al radius compared to the plac@@ ebo treatment significant at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of A@@ cl@@ asta reduced by 30 % compared to the current value and was held at 28 % below the starting point of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting line after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the starting point of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting point after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the starting point of up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirror were not tested for rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; total mort@@ ality was at 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;

the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment led more than 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.2 % at the overall cost and around 4.3 % on the thig@@ h .
&quot; clinical effectiveness in men in HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were conducted 5@@ 08 men , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical trials were 7.5 % with A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.9 % on plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study with males ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to once a weekly gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced to the percentage change in Len@@ den@@ ver@@ teb@@ ra @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison with the output value . &quot;
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the fem@@ ur A@@ cl@@ asta was examined to patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically effective Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the fem@@ ur ( medium Ser@@ um mirror of the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase in accordance with the 2,6@@ 27 @-@ specific upper standard in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was detected in two six months studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease of pain @-@ intensity and pain @-@ controlled compared to the output value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
&quot; patients who were classified as Res@@ p@@ onder on the end of the sixth trial ( on the therapy ) , could be included in a post @-@ observ@@ atory phase . &quot;
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients suffering from the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic treatment could be maintained with 141 of the patients with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 of the treatment phase of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid at 64 patients took the following pharmac@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independently . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel took rapidly from &lt; 10 % of the peak after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the top . &quot;

the early phases of distribution ( α and β with the above @-@ mentioned ½ -@@ values ) probably present the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion about the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of administ@@ ered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of inf@@ usion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ um concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion but had no effect on the area under the curve ( Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation against Time ) .

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ class , called Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the fem@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; taking blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ rogen , which are made from and@@ ro@@ genic , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; by the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , the bone structure takes place too fast , and new bone material is called un@@ arranged , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta works by norm@@ alized the bone structure , thereby creating a normal bone formation , and thus gives the bone again strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or under@@ going a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; with application of A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take other medicines / apply or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , known by those who are aware of the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when applying A@@ cl@@ asta together with food and drinks , you are worried that you have sufficient flu@@ ids in accordance with the instructions of your doctor before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public of this document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ur@@ inary Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the committee has assessed for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insul@@ in dependen@@ cies ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular , overweight patients ) . • It can be applied together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ ational medicine ( du@@ al@@ therapy ) . &quot;
&quot; it can additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be customized with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ ated dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or insul@@ in , the present dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ate or insul@@ in can be kept in the treatment with Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ ris@@ ome or insul@@ in can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body @-@ owned insul@@ in can be better utilized and the blood sugar levels can be adjusted , thus making type @-@ 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients , the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy has been examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ resin material , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible to lo@@ wered the blood sugar levels in use of the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study the effect of additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ fuel produced in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 1.9 % while the extra cost of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 4.84 % .
&quot; in a small study , where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insul@@ in in 28@@ 9 patients were examined , the patients , the accounts in addition to insul@@ in , compared with 0.4 % to 6 months , compared with 0.7 % among patients who were in addition plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( decre@@ asing ) , weight gaining and hypo@@ th@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to maturity ) . &quot;
&quot; accounts must not be applied to patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency ( high killing levels - in blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is intended to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients , the met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission of Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited filed an approval for the transport of accounts in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , dom@@ ed and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the head@@ line &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also shown for the combination with insul@@ in in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose ble@@ eding is inadequate and in@@ compatible with insul@@ in due to contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ations or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age are not available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( for example , coron@@ ary heart disease ) risk , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed based on signs and symptoms of a cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gaining or oil , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed based on signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and oil , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insul@@ in . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients below 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ ular disease .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output of liver enzy@@ me ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the field ) or with other signs of liver illness allowed to be pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
&quot; when the AL@@ T @-@ mirror increases up to 3 times of the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzy@@ me are once again to control as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient symptoms are developed that point out on a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved nau@@ sea , fatigue , ap@@ appeti@@ te and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , the liver enzy@@ me can check . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether the treatment of the patient continues with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , should be led to the laboratory parameters of the clinical evaluation . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was detected a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain , which can be due to obesity and in some cases connected with a fluid re@@ tention . &quot;
as a result of a hem@@ og@@ ram entered the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a minor reduction of middle hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ s ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.3 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ og@@ ram by 3 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.@@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of elevated insul@@ in in@@ sensitivity , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is referred to as or@@ ale two or triple combination therapy with insul@@ in therapy with insul@@ in , the risk of dos@@ is@@ addi@@ cts hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the launch , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , reported via a surge or a deterioration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ul@@ a@@ o@@ de@@ ms , with a reduction in visual conditions . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ o@@ de@@ men , however , if patients report about disorders of visual conditions ; an appropriate oph@@ thal@@ mic evaluation should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summ@@ ari@@ zing analysis of noti@@ fications from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
the investigated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 m@@ outh@@ pieces per 100 patient @-@ years with the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frames per 100 patient @-@ years with women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the analysis of cardiovascular events , frames treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fr@@ ak@@ ations per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes an pregnancy , or this occurs , the treatment is canc@@ eled ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the investigation of the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the Pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic or Pharmac@@ ology dynamic , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in exercises . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs , which are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ale contrast , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulting in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ indu@@ ce ) as a result of lowering the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ished in pregnancy , hyper@@ insul@@ in resistance and increased insul@@ in resistance , and therefore reduce the availability of the metabo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not transfer@@ able ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the gymn@@ as@@ or and the B@@ right index@@ es of the lens as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents played over the triple of the upper limit of the standard area often on how to plac@@ ebo , however less common than in comparison groups among met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ ech@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
&quot; in an out@@ come study with patients with existing advanced fl@@ aw@@ as@@ cular disease , the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the launch of the market , it rarely has been reported on cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ ón was used in combination with insul@@ in or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; in summary , there was conducted a summary analysis of noti@@ fications from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients infected with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients infected with compar@@ ative occupational therapy . &quot;
&quot; in the over a period of 3.5 years running pro@@ active study , frames with 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) with patients . &quot;
&quot; while taking a maximum of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear in any symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ ón seems to act via an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) that leads to the animal @-@ model to an increased insul@@ in @-@ sensitive insul@@ ator of liver and skel@@ eton @-@ muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ tance in case of insul@@ in resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to examine the time until the end of the therapeutic effects ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &gt; 8,@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the treatment a blood sugar ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo@@ controlled study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar has been dis@@ continued despite three @-@ month optimization phase with insul@@ in insufficient , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0,45 % , compared to the patients who remain only insul@@ in ; a reduction of insul@@ in treatment in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
in clinical studies about a year at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on presents a statisti@@ cally significant precip@@ itation of the Alb@@ ums / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ te compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was examined in a small , limited to 18 weeks of study on type @-@ 2 di@@ abe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction of the total plas@@ ma tri@@ gly@@ ca@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as a supplement , but clin@@ ically not significantly enhanced L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ ón in comparison with plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or limb@@ s , and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L @-@ cholesterol level . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was not observed statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d decreased values observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was not only so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the ri@@ descent increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ mirror , this has an effect on the gly@@ ca@@ em@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardi@@ ac out@@ fit study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular treatment were random@@ ized in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardi@@ ac therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ ised , with the peak @-@ concentr@@ ations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in the plas@@ ma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV describes the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ action studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ euticals or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in exercises . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ indu@@ ce ) or lo@@ wers the Plas@@ mac@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral application of radio@@ active striking pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mark@@ er was mainly found in the wood ( 55 % ) and a lower scale in har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the middle Plas@@ ma Eli@@ min@@ ating time of un@@ changing Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is about 5 @-@ 6 hours and the entire active met@@ abol@@ ites lies at 16 - 23 hours .
Plas@@ tic@@ on@@ centr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than for healthy volunteers , whereby the prevalence of the or@@ rh@@ age of the mother sub@@ mer@@ its are similar . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies played with mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , after repeated administration plas@@ ma @-@ enlargement with hem@@ os@@ lu@@ tion , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ cent@@ ric heart disease . &quot;
&quot; this is due to that treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ insul@@ in emia and increased insul@@ in resistance , and therefore reduce the availability of the metabo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were in@@ duced during the Rat for increased inci@@ den@@ ces of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epith@@ eli@@ um .
in a animal @-@ model of the family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous Pol@@ yp@@ osis ( FA@@ P ) the treatment performed with two other Thi@@ ot@@ oli@@ th@@ under@@ ones to an increased frequency of color@@ ont@@ ologists .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the head@@ line &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot; &quot;
the investigated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 m@@ outh@@ pieces per 100 patient @-@ years with the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frames per 100 patient @-@ years with women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the analysis of cardiovascular events , frames treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fr@@ ak@@ ations per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
in another study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were examined .
in clinical studies about 1 year the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant impact of the Alb@@ ums / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ te compared to the output values .
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was not only so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the ri@@ descent increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ mirror , this has an effect on the gl@@ y@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic absorption as well as on the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was not mist@@ aken with regard to their primary end@@ point , which formed a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ deadly m@@ yo@@ car@@ dio syndrome , leg @-@ amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , set the results close that with the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on are not associated with the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the head@@ line &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events regarding bone bro@@ kers from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , showed increased incidence of bon@@ fires in women . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ is has been produced in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as can produce no insul@@ in , and type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes where the body is unable to use insul@@ in effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ans led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c sp@@ y , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similar to that with another human insul@@ in . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ans should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insul@@ in ( pure DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; furthermore , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ans need to be adapted when it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other drugs that can impact on blood sugar ( the complete list is the pack@@ et access ) . &quot;
the committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) have led to the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ is to weigh in the treatment of diabetes towards the risks .
October 2002 the European Commission shared the group of Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to grant permission for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
&quot; mixed insul@@ in products are usually applied once or twice a day , when a fast initiated effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;

&quot; patients whose blood sugar has improved significantly , for example , by an intensive insul@@ in therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can perceive symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;

&quot; if the change to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ans is required for the patient a dosage adjustment , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients where hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions were reported after a change of animal upon human insul@@ in , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; travelling across multiple periods , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , since such trips may lead to that insul@@ in and meals have to be applied and must be taken up to other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and to ask his patients to be bi@@ ased by them .

&quot; once the ur@@ inary s@@ ails after two to four weeks is still more than 6 mg per n@@ il@@ iter , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment system , more and more dense inci@@ dents can occur ; therefore , patients may take at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic or further medicines for prevention of se@@ aling accidents . &quot;

&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 762 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol became used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney disease get only 100 mg per day .
main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary tract levels were found in the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study had 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients , which once daily came up to 120 mg once daily in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in any of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and ab@@ normal liver values . &quot;
especially in patients with cardi@@ ac disease in history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects which concern the heart and blood vessels .
&quot; the committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) came into the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic in the blood was more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;

&quot; clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and fact study as described below ) , which were carried out with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy point was in each study the percentage of patients where the last three months were certain Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ egel &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 200 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) for patients with a ser@@ ver@@ incre@@ mentally worth a degree of studies of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x every day and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 100 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the fact study showed a significant superi@@ ority of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sec@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els under 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 100 mg 1 x daily compared to the used dosage Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sec@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els on &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s physician in week 2 and permanently maintain the entire treatment .
5@@ 09 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serv@@ itude &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney dys@@ function@@ alities The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney metabolism ( d. h .
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient . &quot;
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage of the ser@@ um @-@ shr@@ ubs gra@@ ined in proportions of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ äu@@ re@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations &gt; 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and fact study ) had a ser@@ um concentration of &gt; 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the open renewal study of the Phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 a treatment against a pen@@ ch@@ ill ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients had no treatment against a pen@@ zi@@ pper ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the se@@ al@@ box size associated with 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the se@@ aling line until month 24 .
&quot; increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5,@@ 5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5,@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term studies ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with healthy volunteers , the maximum plas@@ macro @-@ centr@@ ations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ric @-@ curve ( AU@@ C ) is simpler and multi @-@ pler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ dis@@ proportionate increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multi @-@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2,@@ 8 @-@ 3.7 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.6 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in percentage of Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ quar@@ rel@@ oc@@ ate has been observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of 10 @-@ 300 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where bone bro@@ kers ) in women after men@@ opause is a risk for low vitamin D mirror .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the food , drink or absor@@ b of other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium , and vit@@ amin@@ ants ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid an irrit@@ ation of es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take place until after the first food intake of the day , the earliest , 30 minutes after taking the tablet should not lie . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately from each other in medicines which are approved in the European Union , the company entered data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE with regard to increasing vitamin D .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also referred to data that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is exactly the dose which is required for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal he@@ ats , such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sie ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ness , Di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ness , Di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ness , Di@@ ar@@ rho@@ d ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ness , Di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ness , Di@@ ar@@ rho@@ d ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ness , Di@@ ar@@ rho@@ d ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( s@@ wir@@ es ) , sh@@ ou@@ fl@@ es ( mu@@ til@@ ated belly ) as well as sau@@ res rep@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients with et@@ wa@@ iger hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergi@@ es ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other components may not be applied AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in diseases of es@@ oph@@ agus ; in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) , or in patients who do not stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;

&quot; capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the tear of a button on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or ob@@ struction of drugs ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) for the day taking place . &quot;
the following critics are exactly to follow to reduce the risk of im@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be sw@@ allowed after the day of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ ynge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not be taken before the first food intake of the day , taking place early 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ and surgical ble@@ eding or surgical interventions in the upper guest house , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tics , only with special caution are given ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; E@@ soph@@ age@@ al reactions , such as O@@ soph@@ agi@@ tis , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ sion , were rarely followed by ös@@ oph@@ age@@ at ( partly were these severe and required one hospital assignment ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore attentive to all signs and symptoms that point out on possible im@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation , and the patients should be pointed out , while driving on symptoms of im@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation , or new or worse wor@@ ding of the drug , sor@@ ting and medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe he@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients , that may not take the drug correctly and / or it may indicate the occurrence of symptoms that refer to an im@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all the do@@ ves take place to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large cases clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no higher risk has been determined , they were rare ( according to market launch ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and related complications , reports ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose therapies ime are primarily intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there is no data available to indicate whether the de@@ duc@@ ting of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a j@@ aw surgical procedure , reduces the risk of a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the j@@ aw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the treating doctor is critical for treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed their om@@ is@@ sions .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned next week@@ days . &quot;
other conditions which affect the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ .org ) before the start of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE also should be dealt with .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium @-@ supplements , ant@@ acid and some or@@ ale medicines can imp@@ air the or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate when they will be taken at the same time . &quot;
therefore patients must wait after taking care of at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; though specific surveys have not been carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical studies were taken together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without being clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended solely for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at does not leave any evidence of direct compensation effects with regard to pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ; most reports have been reported by cancer patients , but also has been reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the Ser@@ um @-@ Cal@@ ci@@ ums up to &lt; 8,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um - phosph@@ ate to &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl ( anti@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as a result of a oral over@@ dose can occur Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ er@@ emia and side @-@ effects in the upper host , So@@ d@@ burn , Ö@@ soph@@ agi@@ tis , Gast@@ ri@@ tis , or Ul@@ zer@@ a . &quot;

the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at on bone mass and frac@@ tional evidence in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the fr@@ ac@@ upuncture degree study ( FIT : N = 6.@@ 459 ) .

&quot; fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ed controlled studies , in which Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily continue to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at the occurrence of at least a new sp@@ inal score is 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats have revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is divided according to intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg temporarily in soft parts , but then quickly converted into the bones or by the urine . &quot;
&quot; out@@ sourcing of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at became approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substance within 72 hours of urine , and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences . &quot;

&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not dischar@@ ged via the su@@ re or bas@@ al transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects men the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines due to these transportation systems . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ag@@ raf is administ@@ ered for adult patients , to prevent a kidney or liver tran@@ splan@@ ts to prevent a rep@@ ul@@ sion of the tran@@ splan@@ ts of the immune system through the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft has already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gr@@ aft and data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney disease , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ raf has been compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transpl@@ ant was sealed after a treatment period from one year ( by example , for example , how often a renewed organ transpl@@ ant or a resum@@ ption of the di@@ aly@@ sis ) was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transpl@@ ant and 129 patients were carried out with liver transpl@@ ant and investig@@ ates how advoc@@ acy is recorded in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with et@@ wa@@ iger hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergi@@ es ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
patients and doctors need to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken at the same time with Adv@@ ag@@ raf as the advoc@@ acy dosage or the dose of the same drug must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transpl@@ ant patients should arrange this medicine or make changes in the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exports of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transpl@@ ant sho@@ ck@@ ings or an increased incidence of side @-@ side effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ immun@@ o gri@@ lls . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the respective daily dosage ; outlines the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ org@@ y control of one in the transpl@@ ant medical physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in a result of a change to an alternative formulation , has to be carried out a therapeutic medicine and corresponding dosage adjustment to ensure that the system@@ ic exports of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
&quot; the Dos@@ age of Adv@@ ag@@ raf should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of waste , and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ saving provisions ( see below ) recommendations &quot;
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ spiegel should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; 4 was the system@@ ic Ex@@ pos@@ ure , measured as a Tal@@ mirror , with both single form@@ ulations for both kidney and livel@@ i@@ ent patients . &quot;
careful and repeat@@ able controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ spiegel are recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant under Adv@@ ag@@ raf to ensure proper substance Ex@@ pos@@ ure in the direct follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearance , it can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient is allowed in the first post@@ operative phase no oral intake by drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment is intraven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentr@@ ates for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the application of the transpl@@ ant repression of the transpl@@ ant@@ age must be maintained ; consequently , consequently , a maximum duration of the oral therapy can not be specified . &quot;
Dos@@ age recommendations - kidney transpl@@ ant the transpl@@ ant the transpl@@ ant therapy should start with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further Dos@@ age customiz@@ ations can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics can change from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transpl@@ ant . &quot;
Dos@@ age recommendations - liver transpl@@ ant the transpl@@ ant the transpl@@ ant therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; Dos@@ age recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf must be converted to a transpl@@ ant trainer from Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raf , so this switch has in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transpl@@ ant After a switch from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants on Adv@@ ag@@ raf once daily the treatment should start with the transpl@@ ant initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ splan@@ tion .
&quot; transpl@@ ant With adult patients , who are being converted to Adv@@ ag@@ raf is an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day at once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transpl@@ ant receiver Rec@@ ei@@ vers were no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ raf in pul@@ mon@@ ary , p@@ ank@@ atic and super@@ vised patient patients in a oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transpl@@ ant patients in a oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day to use . &quot;
Dos@@ age customiz@@ ations in special patient @-@ patient patients with reduced liver function Z@@ ur maintenance of blood tal@@ reflect in the stimul@@ ated area can be necessary in patients with severe li@@ vi@@ ous disorders of the dose required .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function , the kidney function does not influence the Pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ ver@@ incre@@ mental levels , a calculation of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ incl@@ ear@@ ance and supervision of ur@@ inary tract ) is recommended . &quot;
changing from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ raf in the conversion of a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in@@ - on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; recommendations for the Tal@@ mirror in the full ut , the dose should be based primarily at the clinical evaluation of waste management and toler@@ ances in individual cases under tut@@ oring of full @-@ tac@@ tical Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ spiegel control . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended that frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ spiegel during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant , followed by peri@@ odi@@ c checks during the maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ Tal@@ mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , Dos@@ age adap@@ table , changes to immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us thorou@@ gh@@ center@@ ation ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical studies make sure that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the Tal@@ mirror in the blood is 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; in clinical practice , the Tal@@ mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually lie in the range from 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and at least - and hearty patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent y@@ iel@@ ding therapy of liver , kidney and coron@@ ary tran@@ splan@@ ts , generally used blood @-@ concentration in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this resulted in serious unwanted events , including transpl@@ ant sho@@ ck@@ ings or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or Ex@@ pos@@ ure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the respective daily dosage ; outlines the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ org@@ y control of one in the transpl@@ ant medical physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with a transpl@@ ant marriage , which has proven themselves to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants as therapy therapy , are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
the prophy@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ splan@@ tion in adult cardi@@ ac res@@ eller and transpl@@ ant in childhood are not clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
&quot; due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of tac@@ kl@@ ine levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) is included , or other plant pan@@ ac@@ ea during treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö is a particularly careful monitoring of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentr@@ ations , in the blood , because the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f it was referred to as a cardi@@ omy@@ opathy referred to Kam@@ mer@@ - or sep@@ um@@ hy@@ tro@@ phy that can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors which increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , hydr@@ ation of hydr@@ ation and oil . &quot;
&quot; like with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV @-@ light should be restricted to the potential risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin by appropriate clothes or use of a solar protection by means of a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who occupy the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , changed consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual disorders , should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; da Adv@@ ag@@ raf Hard@@ case , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose , is included in patients with the rare to@@ edit@@ ary Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Int@@ oler@@ ance , L@@ act@@ ase @-@ deficiency or gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose . &quot;
the simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedies which are known as Hem@@ mer or indu@@ ction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; it is therefore recommended to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels at simultaneous gas , which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain even@@ ly concentr@@ ations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
a highly pronounced interaction was performed with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ or@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol and with the Macro@@ lid @-@ antibiotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ prot@@ eas@@ ants ( z . &quot;
&quot; Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies , that the increase in blood levels primarily from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the im@@ itation of the gast@@ ro@@ ger@@ inal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ made Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as is used in acute ho@@ sto@@ ols , the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be metabo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 metabo@@ li@@ zed metabolism .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contr@@ az@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , and so that the hormone can increase , is especially careful in decisions about recep@@ tive measures to be particularly careful . &quot;
the results of animals have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will reduce the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ ac@@ on and their half @-@ time can extend .
&quot; the results of a small number of studies on transpl@@ ant patients do not give any evidence that among other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and result of pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in uter@@ o Ex@@ position , a monitoring of the new@@ born on possible effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ born , i.e. : &quot;
the out@@ patient profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often be found precisely because of the under@@ disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As well @-@ known amongst other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is treated in patients suffering from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ ozo@@ ale ) often increased . &quot;
cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated multi@@ focal leu@@ co@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
it was reported via ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant Ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high bond of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plas@@ map@@ rot@@ eins can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
&quot; drug mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level should be convey@@ ed the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by his bond to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ish protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal transactions because of the T @-@ cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VIII condi@@ tional that inn@@ ate blood @-@ interference ) .
dosage and frequency of application are directed to whether Adv@@ ate is applied for the treatment of ble@@ eding or prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood circulation systems such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plas@@ ma , but according to a method which is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell that has been incorporated into a gene ( DNA ) that it adap@@ ters to the formation of human scent factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , however , is made differently , that the drug does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was evaluated in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ ons with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ del , head@@ aches , Py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human sense factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster@@ ile or one of the other components . &quot;
March 2004 the European Commission of B@@ ax@@ ter AG shared a licence for the transport of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
&quot; dosage dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy is based on the gravity of the factor VIII defect , after the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
in the following hem@@ ical occurr@@ ences the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period cannot be under the given Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel ( in % of the standard or in that / dl ) .
inj@@ ecting all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repe@@ ating until the pain and the acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger for the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , the controlling of the enrich@@ ment dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections is an appropriate determination of the factor VIII sculpture . &quot;
individual patients may differ in reaction to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ times .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis Z@@ ur long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be doses between 20 and 40 i.e. from factor VIII pro kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plas@@ ma activities cannot be reached or if the ble@@ eding is not domin@@ ating with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to detect any in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ or values , it is possible that the factor VIII treatment is not effective so that other therapeutic interventions must be wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; the arrangement speed is to be directed after the patient , with maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII pur@@ pos@@ ing Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plas@@ ma by modi@@ fying Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , taking the risk within the first 20 executive days on the largest and by genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) , with more than 100 executive bodies and an@@ am@@ nest@@ y @-@ known incar@@ nation development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the repe@@ al of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors observed . &quot;
due to the rare occurrence of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women lie beyond the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding has no experience .
&quot; most of the patients with the greatest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who all have previously experienced in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , is not known ( frequency based on the available data not transfer@@ able ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of each patient ( 234 persons ) The unexpected waste from the blood flow factor VIII below the post @-@ surgical day ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plas@@ ma and the clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post@@ operative day .

&quot; the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins has been analysed by exam@@ ining the anti @-@ em@@ bodi@@ ment against these proteins , lab parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant performance levels as well as an ongoing peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell proteins , otherwise there are no signs or symptoms resulting in an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ tes with several repeti@@ tive product @-@ positions within the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the first version of the currently available data the CH@@ MP has continued to be assessed as positive , but considering that the security profile needs to be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the Security Board of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the admission fee in five years is supposed to apply for a further renewal procedure . &quot;
December 2008 Com@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited announces the committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) officially stated that the company takes its application for the authorisation of Adv@@ ancement for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer .
&quot; however , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue , which connects other structures in the body , surround it and supports it . &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of virus that was gene@@ tically modified , that there is a gene in the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ exin is a &quot; &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; which has changed so that there cannot produce any copies of themselves and thus do not cause infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ancement could have been st@@ ained directly into the tum@@ ors and enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the un@@ broken DNA in the human body , is usually made to restore corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company laid data from a study involving a patient , at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the field of sub@@ tree , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after CH@@ MP reviewed the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ explained . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of initial submitted documentation , the CH@@ MP is created on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
according to CH@@ MP opinion was not sufficiently demonstrated that the inj@@ ections of Adv@@ exin in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits will take advantage for the patients .
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medication by means of the body , the type of administration , as well as the security of the drug . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the company had not proven sufficient that Adv@@ ancement can be established in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company set the CH@@ MP not aware of whether the jud@@ gement consequences for patients , which currently take part in clinical studies or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ancement . &quot;
changing drug @-@ release &quot; means that tablets are so mer@@ ged that one of the effective components immediately and the other will slowly be released over a few hours .
&quot; aer@@ on@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( h@@ ay @-@ sn@@ aps , caused by allergi@@ es against poll@@ en ) in patients with nose @-@ irrit@@ ation ( pet@@ ri@@ fied nose ) . &quot;
in adults and young people older than 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ on@@ ze is twice daily one tablet that should be taken very with a glass of water with or without food .
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ ger@@ m ( pet@@ ri@@ fied nose ) . &quot;
treatment of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be checked on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main responsibilities were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ yst@@ ack symptoms which were reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study the patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours into a journal , and rated with a standard sk@@ ala , how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; considering all ha@@ yst@@ ack symptoms besides the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported the Aer@@ ators , about a decrease of symptoms by 46,@@ 0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % among patients , the pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nose res@@ end@@ omet@@ rium was regarded , the patients showed a relief of symptoms by 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % compared to the patients , the des@@ o@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ on@@ ze ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( cardi@@ tis ) , harmon@@ izing , head@@ ache , fatigue , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nie ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ ol@@ ences ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , sleeping disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ on@@ ze may be in case of patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other parts , against po@@ etic agents or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another drug for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ on@@ ze must also not be applied in patients , suffering from hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , ur@@ inary or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) , or have had a risk of hem@@ orrho@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission on the company SP Europe distributed approval for the transport of aer@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is on the whole ( i.e. , without cr@@ ush , broken or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ on@@ ze should be applied because of the failure of data on in@@ consistency and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) , not to children under 12 years of age . &quot;
the application &apos;s duration is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of 10 days , because in long @-@ term application the activity of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease in time . &quot;
&quot; after the fall of the swelling of the grin@@ ding in the upper respir@@ atory , the treatment can be continued when needed with des@@ o@@ at@@ adin than mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ ina@@ ze Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the drug is also contr@@ ain@@ dicated in patients suffering from a mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or treated or within the 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attri@@ but@@ able to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combination with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ a , Per@@ go@@ lid , Per@@ go@@ lid , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin or other de@@ co@@ on@@ tiv@@ a , phen@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , phen@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ in , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy has not been tested for this patient @-@ collective and the data is not enough to express the recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ on@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data is not enough to express the recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment at the appearance of a hyper@@ tension or a speed@@ ometer , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be set . &quot;
&quot; with the treatment of the following patient groups , to be cau@@ tious : • patients under digital anxiety • patients with cardi@@ ac disease in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , Blas@@ en@@ hal@@ so@@ b@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ina@@ ze has at least 48 hours prior to performing dermat@@ ological testing , since anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for front actions or to reduce their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered , however , were not observed clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in Plas@@ mac@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psychological testing , no significant differences could be found between the patients with des@@ o@@ at@@ adin and those with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether de@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was alone or with alcohol . &quot;
for the met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible Enzy@@ m has not been identified yet so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ eins .
the dis@@ satisfaction of the application of aer@@ on@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to gain experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies but does not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities when compared to the frequency of normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transmitted to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ a properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied Aer@@ ators in pregnancy .
&quot; however , patients should be understood that in very rare cases it can come to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to a impair@@ ment of traffic resistance or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; the symptoms can vary between a Z@@ n@@ NS depression ( Se@@ en@@ coding , ap@@ nea , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ aps ) and a Z@@ N @-@ stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , Tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering conclusions . &quot;
&quot; head@@ aches , anxiety , scar@@ ce mic@@ ron@@ eous , muscle weakness , arousal , irrit@@ ation , t@@ ach@@ y@@ ar@@ die , t@@ ach@@ y@@ ar@@ die , path@@ ological , v@@ om@@ iting , t@@ wit@@ ches , t@@ innitus , respir@@ atory , t@@ innitus , irrit@@ ation , and hyper@@ tension , or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a T@@ NS stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as astr@@ on@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , p@@ up@@ tible and - di@@ lat@@ ation , grasp , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ man@@ in@@ ale symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ gr@@ ory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molec@@ ule P @-@ Sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells . &quot;
&quot; with an individual dose of an adult , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the rein@@ forcement of subjective keys , or the tasks linked to the catch . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage was found by 5 mg daily no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can give further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ e@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifestations of an Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ ok@@ ze tablets received . &quot;
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ a@@ ze tablets was determined by the overall cor@@ es for the symptoms ( except nose @-@ irrit@@ ation swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine about the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the fluctu@@ ating effect certainly was significantly higher than below a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets showed in terms of gender , age or ethnic group defined patient groups no significant differences . &quot;
in the context of a single dose of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the Aer@@ ok@@ ze is des@@ o@@ at@@ adin within 30 minutes after administration in the plas@@ ma del@@ ectable .
&quot; according to the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ ina@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow of disaster was achieved by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine at day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ is@@ study , which was carried out with the formulation as tablet into healthy adult pro@@ b@@ ahs , has been noted that four Pro@@ b@@ anden Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was too mist@@ aken . &quot;
a component interaction review shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the all@@ u@@ ate of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ equivalent was the exposure to gin of a aer@@ on@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies for security , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity and reproduction , the pre@@ dat@@ at@@ adin can be seen no particular dangers for humans . &quot;
the combination poss@@ essed no greater tox@@ icity than its constitu@@ ents and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredients of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in re@@ production sto@@ ic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was in@@ cum@@ bent on rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and an rab@@ bit in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day non ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic .

&quot; in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies have been taken up , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms number ) by 25 to 26 % compared to the patients who were a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symptoms after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % compared with plac@@ ebo treated patients . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission shared a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ sec@@ ting and Persian rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) . &quot;
it gives limited experience from clinical trials to the effectiveness in applying Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin at youth from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ involved allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease process and can be added after the end of the symptoms and may be resum@@ ed in their re@@ percus@@ sions .
&quot; in the Persian allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during the aller@@ ing period . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established in the context of clinical studies with des@@ o@@ at@@ adin tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was additionally administ@@ ered ( see under section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the high intake of alcohol and alcohol was not reinforced by alcohol ( see under section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases , it can come to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to a impair@@ ment of traffic resistance or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently be@@ aten side effects , about the more common than when plac@@ ebo was reported , fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , m@@ outh@@ fulness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 578 juven@@ ile patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side @-@ effect head@@ aches , these were treated at 5.5 % of the patient who were treated with des@@ o@@ at@@ adin and at 6.9 % of the patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin will be administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ gr@@ ory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molec@@ ule P @-@ Sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical trial with multi @-@ car@@ d@@ ants , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was administ@@ ered for up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administ@@ ered over ten days , showed up no extension of Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; in a single @-@ dos@@ ed study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening of subjective keys , or the tasks associated with the catch . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as kidney secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , itch , sad@@ ness and redness of the eyes as well as itch on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into dependence on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and Persian rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall cor@@ es of the frag@@ ments for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , the ag@@ eri@@ us effectively are produced by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was investigated for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ology in the different forms is similar and chron@@ ically @-@ prosp@@ ective patients can be consider@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; since the history of inf@@ lic@@ ting a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ ari@@ al diseases is expected , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is expected to improve in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic urine , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first Dos@@ age interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients , who were not covered on anti@@ hist@@ amine , from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch to more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ o@@ at@@ adin patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and of vig@@ il@@ ess , as measured by a 4 @-@ points scale to evaluate this variable . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic study , where patients were compared with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , was achieved in 4 % of patients with a higher concentration of des@@ o@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no cl@@ ue for a clin@@ ically relevant g@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , the enzy@@ me responsible for the met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ o@@ at@@ adin is not identified yet so that interactions with other drugs should not be ruled out completely . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ eins .

the clinical trials performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin at a compar@@ able degree of extrac@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies for security sp@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeat@@ ability , Gen@@ o@@ ox@@ icity and to reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can be seen no special dangers for man . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ sec@@ ting and Persian rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by children under 2 years by infection ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that no data are available to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; besides the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ alies should play a role in diagnos@@ ing the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical studies and appropriate laboratory studies . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabo@@ lic ster@@ o@@ adin can be restricted and experienced a higher sub @-@ impact rate ( see under Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , the limited metabo@@ lic metabo@@ lic , is identical to the children that is normal metabo@@ li@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inherited problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ electro@@ act@@ ose absorption or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ atic in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medicine should not take . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was additionally administ@@ ered ( see under section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the high intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not reinforced by alcohol ( see under section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall prevalence of side @-@ effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as compared to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study on adults and adolescents , administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , which came to question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy in question , received a daily DES@@ lor@@ ries of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ ates / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine and the profile of des@@ o@@ at@@ adin can be similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ o@@ at@@ adin can be extrac@@ ted in adults on children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical trial with multiple adults and juven@@ iles , used in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and juven@@ iles , used in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) has been applied over ten days for adults , showed up no extension of Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage was evaluated by 5 mg daily for adults and young people no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness in comparison with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us tablets with adults and young people in clinical studies have no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ ors .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies on adults it came up by the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to rein@@ forcement of alcohol in@@ duced performance anxiety still to an increase in sle@@ ep@@ iness .
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective at the all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as kidney secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , itch , sad@@ ness and redness of the eyes as well as itch on the pal@@ ate . &quot;

&quot; in two plac@@ ebo controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic urine , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first Dos@@ age interval . &quot;
&quot; the dissem@@ ination of this restricted metabo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ panel study with the si@@ pping form@@ atting to children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that can be restricted .
&quot; after 3 to 6 hours , the burden ( AU@@ C ) was about 3 to 6 hours approximately 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a tempor@@ al half @-@ time period of about 120 hours . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. on the board for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) officially stated that the company takes its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and older people for the protection against flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 des In@@ flu@@ enza A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine , which could result in front of a trunk of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus emerg@@ es , which can easily spread from man to man because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system that the vaccine contained in the vaccine is called &quot; physical &quot; and is antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is later able to make contact with a grip @-@ virus of this pedi@@ gree more quickly . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the Mem@@ bran@@ e cover of the virus with the &quot; &quot; surface area &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the surface of the surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as body @-@ alien ) , and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; insp@@ ections of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is not out of fulfilling the requirements of the E@@ MEA for presidential vaccines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information on your treatment , please contact your physician . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific debate ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , associated with human immun@@ o@@ evi@@ rus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which is infected by the acquired immune syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot sw@@ allow the capsules are not consumed as a solution to disposable , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase should only be re@@ acted when the doctor has examined , which anti@@ viral medicines have been taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood is that the virus is attached to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice a day , which are consumed with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg is the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase according to the body weight .
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is reduced in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS does not cure , however , can delay the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which previously did not have been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; this enhanced with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced drug as@@ gener@@ ase has been taken in 206 adults , the previously prot@@ eas@@ ers , compared with other prot@@ eas@@ ers . &quot;
main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with not veri@@ fiable concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the variation of the Vir@@ us last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ eas@@ ers , although after 48 weeks of a virus less than 400 copies / ml than among plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase has also decreased the Vir@@ us@@ last but with the children who previously been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ant , only very few to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , previously treated with prot@@ eas@@ ant , lo@@ wered the Vir@@ us last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ ers : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resist@@ ent against four other prot@@ eas@@ ant drug , there came under a general waste of Vir@@ us last for four weeks than in patients who have continued their previous prot@@ eas@@ ers : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of hem@@ os@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , Flat@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generative Diseases can also not be applied in patients , the cur@@ rants ( a herbal medication used to treat depression ) or medicines , which are just as orph@@ an@@ ase in the blood of health and harmful . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines on HIV , the A@@ generative Diseases are taking the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( modifications in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( lev@@ eling of bone tissue ) , or an immun@@ o@@ activ@@ ating syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection that can be caused by the re@@ viewing immune system ) . &quot;
the committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) have led to the conclusion that the benefits of a general application in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years across the risks covered .
&quot; gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee fixed that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have contrac@@ ep@@ tive in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as they were limited to limited information at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission of G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited filed an approval for the transport of as@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
&quot; generic medicines has been shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ eas@@ ant adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usual , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administ@@ ered by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral pesti@@ cides , and the treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to absor@@ b is 14 % lower than amp@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for one @-@ milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ change@@ able ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for as@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 When A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fied supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses should be applied to as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for as@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ euticals , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other amino acids were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data to un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose to as@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe li@@ vi@@ ability to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
simultaneous application is to be carried out in patients with mild or moderate Leb@@ er@@ ability with caution when patients with severe li@@ vi@@ ability is contr@@ ain@@ dicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; a general must not be given at the same time by pharmac@@ euticals , which represent a low therapeutic width and also provide sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal supplements containing cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk minim@@ ized plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contam@@ ination with blood .
&quot; for usual , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis , have an increased risk of heavy vi@@ cious interactions with potentially deadly disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the relevant information of these medicines . &quot;
patients with existing constraints of living conditions including a chron@@ ically @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ol@@ ses or other glu@@ co@@ f@@ co@@ ids that can be switched on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of treatment is covered the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ depen@@ ded and Supp@@ lies of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended as simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ su@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
&quot; 4 For some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International norm@@ ised Rati@@ o ) , are methods to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; patients who are taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to decreased plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ons of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r less effective ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabo@@ lic interactions with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal supplements can be changed , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ cat@@ astrop@@ hic symptoms , especially if there is also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ on the A@@ generative solution , this intestinal form of children under the age of four years is conf@@ isc@@ ated and should be applied with caution with certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase should be set to duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the v@@ eils are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ eas@@ ants , has been reported via the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an expedition of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had different diseases to be linked to their therapy medicines which are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug addi@@ tive factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabo@@ lic disorders associated with the associated metabo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ant , reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous anxiety , hem@@ at@@ oms and ha@@ j@@ thro@@ sen . &quot;
in HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immun@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tic therapy can develop an anti @-@ inflammatory reactions to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial Ä@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol intake , heavy immun@@ og@@ gles , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , were reported cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Sub@@ str@@ ate with low therapeutic width of a general must not be given simultaneously by medicines which represent a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ate of Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of as@@ gener@@ ase is not allowed to be contrac@@ ted with drugs whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plastic s@@ ails with heavy and / or life @-@ threatening effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C is caused by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r who can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical conc@@ eal and to a resident development .
&quot; in trying to equ@@ alize the hum@@ ble plas@@ mas@@ cot by a dose of other prot@@ o @-@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects on the liver have been observed . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient enjoys a cur@@ rant , the am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r@@ ally and , if possible , the Vir@@ us load is to check and the cur@@ rant is un@@ ra@@ zed . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the drug is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence down ) .
5@@ 08 % increased for C@@ max by 30 % lower if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily applied , which occupy the efficacy and im@@ mortality of this treatment . &quot;
52 % lower when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) administ@@ ered .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in the plas@@ ma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a do@@ cking recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended however a con@@ stric@@ ted monitoring , since the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the anta@@ em@@ aker component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , is recommended for at least one hour apart at least one hour ( see ant@@ acid below ) . &quot;
therefore in gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would be reduced .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ eas@@ ers and existing limited data might susp@@ ect that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ points may susp@@ ect the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable to be treated as del@@ avi@@ r@@ din because of decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ mas@@ cot less effective . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of combining am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous gift of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in plas@@ mas@@ on@@ cent@@ ric ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at 193 % , and thus a rise in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; when it is possible for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase is advised to reduce the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not conducted but could be increased the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ kes of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol a daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol at Plas@@ ma ( 0 replies ) to the 2.8 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or indu@@ ction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , potentially to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be applied to toxic responses , associated with these medicines , when applied in combination with a gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ ers it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase , since it can occur to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va , which are known as an enzy@@ mes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plas@@ mas@@ tic level of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um @-@ concentr@@ ations of calcium processors like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Field tu@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ ti@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ ti@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , thereby causing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can increase its plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ations considerably , and reinforce PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors in conjunction with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual impair@@ ments and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in a clinical trial where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules are given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days to pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate ( 90 % -@@ fi@@ asco intervals : 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these gl@@ ko@@ kor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment can survive the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors on such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ su@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases of plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel with simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel@@ increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations to stabili@@ zation the mirror , since the plas@@ tic@@ on@@ centr@@ ations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased at simultaneous genes of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
therefore it must not be applied together with oral bi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while on the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ants point to a possible increase in the plas@@ mas@@ cot of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3- to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on o@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , particularly if there is also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; due to the per se of small compar@@ ability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adjust how the am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be adapted when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ised Rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ arthritis effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predic@@ table ; therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption is recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side @-@ effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in simultaneous genes of as@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; this medication may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful dis@@ ruption of possible utility for the mother , compared to the possible risks for fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk of activ@@ ating rats , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r on people move into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a reproduction study of impair@@ ments that was administ@@ ered by the em@@ bodi@@ ment in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r was showed during the lac@@ tation period a decreased increase of 12 body weight in the post@@ pon@@ ement .
the further development of the offspring including Fer@@ til@@ ity and reproduction capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r on the dam@@ s .
the in@@ consistency of as@@ gener@@ ase has been examined in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the effects associated with the A@@ generative treatment side effects were slightly up to moderate , occurred early and often led to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV treatment of applied medicines , or whether they are a result of the under@@ disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects originate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ eas@@ ant patients received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which were valued by the investig@@ ator than in connection with the study media below and in more than 1 % of patients appeared , as well as under the treatment performed surgery . ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) with HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and potential under@@ skin tissues , more extrac@@ ting and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissues , hyper@@ trop@@ y of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ dium of fat . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ spect as not previously treated individuals , which were treated with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ in over a middle duration of 36 weeks , was only observed one case ( Sti@@ t@@ ack ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , at 245 NR@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with various NR@@ s over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; rash were usually slightly up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ ed or mak@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ent nature , with or without itch , and disappeared spont@@ aneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks without having to be canc@@ eled with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose have been reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis ( ART ) . &quot;
in case of HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immun@@ otherapy can develop an anti @-@ inflammatory therapy ( ART ) to develop an anti @-@ inflammatory reactions to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections .
&quot; in with PI @-@ treated patients , which were 600 mg of a gener@@ ase twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degrees 3 and 4 ) which were observed under all@@ evi@@ ated increases of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ - and CP@@ K values which were used in patients suffering from low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently . &quot;

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both ak@@ ut and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as in periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute cells and is provided with chronic µ@@ M with chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the im@@ itation of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in people is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ ine not previously @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r used treatment schem@@ as - the described mut@@ ations only rarely observed .

&quot; a mon@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , where a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure did not appear within the 59 , with prot@@ eas@@ ant patients showed resistance to those who were in adults . &quot;

based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance based analysis of Gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .

&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always approach the current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems for analy@@ zing the results of resistance . &quot;
based on ph@@ e@@ otyp@@ ical resistance based analysis @-@ based analysis @-@ based inter@@ pret@@ ating systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are applied to patients with prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests , have been clin@@ ically @-@ phenomen@@ al Cut @-@ off@@ s ( partition points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a pesti@@ cides . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r associ@@ ative pattern generates a certain clo@@ ency against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity of in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , cl@@ avi@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ers for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r Resi@@ sten@@ z@@ pf@@ ad either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ spect as not previously treated patients , with which a degrad@@ ation against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ate insulation ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isolation . &quot;
the early departure of a vers@@ oul therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can affect the following treatment .
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cl@@ e@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( NR@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , mainly obtained with a low @-@ carbon k@@ ill@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a hundred and thre@@ ef@@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one NR@@ TI were included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ suff@@ r@@ ity of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the period of the output level ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ age ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plas@@ ma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ negoti@@ able wave of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ broken as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 million infected children aged 2 to 18 , from which 152 had been treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in studies , a general solution to take and capsules in doses from 15 mg / kg every day , 20 mg / kg every day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it was given no low do@@ si@@ zed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the PI @-@ treated patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ LA , together with a gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plas@@ ma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with an medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
19 basi@@ l on these data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation with PI @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ted &quot; gener@@ alities .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to maximum Ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
5@@ 08 % increased for C@@ max to lo@@ wered by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % discount of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influenced the scale and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can conclude on a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance at the plas@@ ma , with the quantity of im@@ min@@ ent Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ used am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of free active components in dependence on the overall drug @-@ concentration in the Ste@@ ady state across the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines , those CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bits or inhi@@ bits a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generative capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is made out of the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ ly than from capsules , hence are a general solution and as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able at a milli@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney function is likely to be minor on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment cl@@ ata lead to am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ds comparable those that are obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies to the c@@ rank@@ y with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , with doses , ben@@ i@@ ne hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular cor@@ at@@ ant with doses , after 2,@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , un@@ covered . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been understood and the relevance of this observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; however , there are little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , but there is little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity testing , the bacterial @-@ reverse gu@@ ise tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , was am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and monitored in clinical everyday life by the measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; previously , clinical studies have not been observed any significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase even after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate both during the control and with the use of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; for a system@@ ic plas@@ ma exposure , the significant under ( rab@@ bit ) or not significant higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage were observed , but have been observed a number of low changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and light skel@@ eton , which point to a dev@@ oti@@ onal development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fied supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses should be applied to as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for as@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application is to be carried out in patients with f@@ aint or mild liver dis@@ rup@@ ting with caution when patients with severe li@@ vi@@ ability is contr@@ ain@@ dicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; 26 For some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International norm@@ ised Rati@@ o ) , are methods to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase should be set up on length 27 , when a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk to a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addi@@ tive factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabo@@ lic disorders associated with the associated metabo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C is caused by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r who can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical conc@@ eal and to a resident development .
5@@ 08 % increased for C@@ max by 30 % lower if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in the plas@@ ma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a do@@ cking recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended however a con@@ stric@@ ted monitoring , since the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would be reduced .
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of combining am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; when it is possible for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase is advised to reduce the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um @-@ concentr@@ ations of calcium processors like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Field tu@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ ti@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ ti@@ pin , n@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , thereby causing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
in a clinical trial where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules are given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days to pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate ( 90 % -@@ fi@@ asco intervals : 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; at simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ised Rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ arthritis effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl es@@ tradi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; this medication may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful dis@@ ruption of the possible utility for the mother , compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
a reproduction study of impair@@ ments that was administ@@ ered by the em@@ estation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r was showed during the lac@@ tation period a decreased increase in body weight during the breast@@ feeding .
the in@@ consistency of as@@ gener@@ ase has been examined in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is an indication of an indication ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both ak@@ ut and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute cells and is included in µ@@ µ@@ M with chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0,50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ate insulation ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isolation . &quot;
&quot; based on this data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation with PI , to be expected to be considered to be expected . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ used am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of free active components in dependence on the overall drug @-@ concentration in the Ste@@ ady state across the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;

&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the impact of kidney function is likely to be minor on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies to the c@@ ens@@ ity with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , with doses , ben@@ i@@ ne hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular cor@@ at@@ oc@@ ular cor@@ at@@ ant with dos@@ ages , which exc@@ el the 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been understood and the relevance of this observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; however , there are little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity testing , the bacterial @-@ reverse gu@@ ise tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was im@@ pe@@ en@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate both during the control and with the use of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these findings make sure that in Jung@@ le the met@@ abol@@ ism passages are not fully mature , so that Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of wor@@ ding ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to be used is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ eas@@ ants ( PI ) -@@ previously @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; n@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase solution for entry was neither with PI @-@ treated patients nor with PI @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to absor@@ b is 14 % lower than amp@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for one @-@ milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ change@@ able ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should , once they are able to sw@@ allow the capsules , with taking the solution to the inser@@ tion ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for a general solution is 17 mg ( 1,@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , as no dosage recommended for the simultaneous use of a general solution to absor@@ b and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination with these patient groups can be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment is not necessary for Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , is an application of a gener@@ ase solution to involve patients with kidney failure . ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ on is a general solution to participate in small children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver suffer@@ ings and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration may result in a compens@@ ate im@@ itation of the met@@ abol@@ isation of these medicines and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening effects of ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk 47 of transmission of HIV to others due to sexual contact or contam@@ ination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International norm@@ ised Rati@@ o ) , are methods to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase should be set off on a long run , when a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk to a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addi@@ tive factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabo@@ lic disorders associated with the associated metabo@@ lic disorders . &quot;

the in@@ consistency of as@@ gener@@ ase has been examined in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV treatment of applied medicines , or whether they are a result of the under@@ disease . &quot;
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ ine not previously @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r used treatment schem@@ as - the described mut@@ ations only rarely observed .

&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the drug ) . • Al@@ dara has been tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with War@@ zen in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with complete degrad@@ ation of the patients . • Al@@ dara has also been examined to 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , in which the patients were treated six weeks and al@@ dara or plac@@ ebo either a day or five times a week . &quot;
main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete lowering of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara has also been tested in two studies in total 505 patients with ak@@ tin@@ ic ceramics .

local Hau@@ actions are common but the intensity of these reactions is generally accepted during therapy or the reactions should be returned after completion of treatment with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od creams .
&quot; if it is necessary because of the discomfort of the patient or because of sever@@ ity of the local application actions , a treatment periods can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the treatment of untreated skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment .
&quot; there is currently no data on long @-@ term healing @-@ rates of over 36 months after treatment , should consider other suitable therapy forms . &quot;
&quot; patients with recur@@ rent and previously @-@ treated BC@@ C@@ s are not clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in advance tum@@ ours . &quot;

there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for the treatment of sac@@ tin@@ ent ceramics to anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the acoustic ker@@ at@@ ose of the under@@ poor and hands support the effectiveness in this application form , therefore , such application is not recommended . &quot;
local pan@@ de@@ actions often occur but these reactions usually take effect during the therapy of intensity or go back after the treatment of therapy with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream .
&quot; if local skin actions are causing great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed to some days . &quot;
&quot; for the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AK@@ F@@ ittings provide lower total heating rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot;

at 60 % of the total of 119 with i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od therapy patients healed patients completely off ; this was at 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo therapies in the case ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved during 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od during five mal@@ function application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; hist@@ ological confirmed , individual primary super @-@ cell bases with a minimum size of 0.5 cm ² and a maximum diameter of 2 cm . &quot;
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of these data show that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;

&quot; the year @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show patients with clin@@ ician cooling , after one or two treatment periods of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; the approved indications of extern@@ ally F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts , Ak@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ opo@@ elles in case of pa@@ edi@@ atric patients are usually not tested and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dara Cre@@ am was examined in four random@@ ized , double blind @-@ controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od could not be shown in these studies in these studies ( 3x / Week for a period of &lt; 16 weeks ) .
a minimal system@@ ic admission of the 5 % long I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream with the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest standards of pharmac@@ euticals in Ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and buried 0.1 , 0,@@ 2 and 1.6 g / ml with the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
&quot; the obvious semi @-@ term semi @-@ hour period was approximately 10@@ times higher than the first half @-@ hour time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study , which indicates a prolonged re@@ tention of the medication by means of the skin . &quot;
&quot; the data for system@@ ic Ex@@ pos@@ ure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od presented according to top@@ ical application on MC disease patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable with healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ ose , or super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on the paint tox@@ icity in the rat , doses of 0,5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG , a significantly lower body weight and increased sp@@ leen ; one also four months a guided study on the paint application flo@@ wed no similar effects on the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice with mice in three days a week in@@ duced no tum@@ ors on the use site .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption from human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic is a risk to humans due to system@@ ic exposure to very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice , treated with the effective cream , formerly and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; in the study the safety of the drug was examined , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by exam@@ ining his effect on reducing G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine and regarding the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years of age , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine by about 60 % , and half the children treated at the end of the study a normal large liver . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain relief , Ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , pain reduction , pain in limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat pumps , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion set . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of the lung function ) , T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be applied in patients suffering from hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not applied . &quot;
&quot; the European Pharmac@@ euticals agency ( E@@ MEA ) is given every year to all new information , which may be known , examine and update this summary as required . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is obtained patients who obtained Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with regards to the reactions to the inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 the European Commission shared the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. represented an approval for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ l @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mammals @-@ cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is for long @-@ time enzy@@ mes in patients with secure diagnosis of a sample ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ osis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ l @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase @-@ deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the illness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabo@@ lic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can if the patient can be toler@@ ated all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no do@@ ves can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined and for these patients no do@@ ves can be recommended .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients may develop infectious reactions that are defined as any in connection @-@ effect , which occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored much more closely and the inf@@ usion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , in which re@@ plac@@ ements for medical emergen@@ cies should be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is usually formed within 3 months from treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infectious reaction , need to be treated with caution at the use of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; since little experience in order to resume the treatment after a longer break , must be careful due to the theoretical risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction after a break in treating the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the beginning of inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to try to minimize the potential inf@@ usion reaction .
in the event of an easy or medium @-@ sized infectious reaction should treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or reducing the inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
&quot; in case of a single , severe infectious reaction , the inf@@ usion has to be stopped , until the symptoms are brought to decline , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 are ( Anti @-@ hist@@ amine / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in inf@@ usion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate in which the incur@@ red reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase consists . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies cannot be directed to the direct or indirect impact on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ natural development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as no data to new@@ born , which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ asy about the breast milk , it is recommended while treating with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the side effects in clinical trials were ordered mainly as inf@@ usion set reactions , which were observed during 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) . &quot;
&quot; unwanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension to a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration : very frequently ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respir@@ atory and lungs in the previous history , there were heavy reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing problems and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children &apos;s unwanted drug addi@@ tive effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a Ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with a predominantly severe form of delay and duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients there occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ tation version , whereby patients aged 5 years with a serious drop @-@ form ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days of patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature exp@@ ir@@ ation from the study ) , for 13 / 45 patients no by radio@@ immun@@ o@@ it@@ ational antibodies , including 3 patients where it never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ versions . &quot;
patients with error to the low anti @-@ em@@ bodi@@ ment presented a stur@@ dy reduction in the G@@ AG &apos;s Spi@@ eg@@ els in the Har@@ n during patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction in G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal to low neutr@@ alised inhibit@@ or effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ st activity in vit@@ ro which seemed not to imp@@ air the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of unwanted drug interactions , even though the occurrence of unwanted disease interactions typically coinci@@ de with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies . &quot;
the justi@@ fication for the enzy@@ mes is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the cum@@ ulative sub@@ str@@ ate and the prevention of another accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzy@@ mes .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ asis is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ or@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were rec@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient marked the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients have been en@@ rolled when they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute en@@ closures in the 6 @-@ minute walking distance .
&quot; all patients have subsequently been rec@@ ited for an open @-@ label evaluation study , where they received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks therapy , the patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms treated patients compared to the plac@@ ebo group enhancing the lung function and the en@@ vi@@ ability given in the following table . &quot;
the open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as follows from the following table .
the decrease of the percentage percentage percentage is about this period clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with an Hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly in the treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study were a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks a more significant waste from the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established , which remained constant until the degree of study . &quot;
&quot; regarding the heter@@ ogen@@ ic path@@ ogen@@ ic disease among the patients , which coinci@@ de with the use of a combined end@@ setting ( an expected percentage range of five patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) and a deterioration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a year @-@ year open phase @-@ 2 study was conducted in which primarily the safety and pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was investigated until the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the severe dis@@ continued form and 4 with the middle temporary form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased by increased G@@ AG@@ A mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) has been established after the Z @-@ score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mid @-@ term form , while older patients with severe dis@@ continued development can be determined only limited or even any progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a Phase 4 study , investigations into a pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ do@@ atisation sch@@ ata were carried out at the G@@ AG mirror in the resin , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute en@@ closures were carried out . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the Do@@ zation scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every two weeks in patients suffering with weekly inf@@ usions , a reasonable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two Do@@ atisation are equal . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will provide any new information which will be available , evaluated annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug can be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to the patients suffering from older and less affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies for security , tox@@ icity , with non @-@ profit fields , tox@@ icity in repeti@@ tive g@@ abe and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data can be seen no special dangers for man . &quot;

&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fol@@ ate acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin additionally an &quot; anti @-@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( drugs against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liqui@@ ds ( for a fluid angel ) . &quot;
&quot; patients whose blood picture changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should arise up , set off or reduce the dose . &quot;
&quot; the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed demanded the formation of DNA and RNA , and prevents the cells divide . &quot;
&quot; the transformation of ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of drug and a long @-@ term life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study on 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their condition . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ prolifer@@ ative lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were treated in 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which had previously been treated with chemotherapy ( other medicines for cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , and both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin received in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9,@@ 3 months during all administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; patients who had previously received an chemotherapy was obtained , was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared to 7.3 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , patients suffering from cancer not carry the record epith@@ eli@@ um , during administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer lifetime than with the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission shared the El@@ i Lil@@ ly Ne@@ derland B.@@ V. entitled to transport A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
each bag has to be saved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % more so@@ dium injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from penetration and with 0.@@ 9 % more so@@ dium injection @-@ solution ( 9 mg / ml ) on 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ commercial bron@@ chi@@ al epith@@ eli@@ um ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is shown for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al epith@@ eli@@ al epith@@ eli@@ um ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body ( KO@@ F ) is administ@@ ered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .

&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin actions must be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oid . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 cans , and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy sector , and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third def@@ ying cycle .
&quot; patients who receive ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be created before every gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a plat@@ el@@ ism . &quot;
al@@ kal@@ ische phosph@@ or@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dosage will take place under rec@@ kl@@ ating the blood picture or the maximum not @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA than mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common toxic C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) &gt; C@@ TC degree 2 blood circulation .
&quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity &gt; degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , therapy has to be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA needs to be abandoned when in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ t@@ ti@@ o a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or not @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 or so@@ - fort at the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials has no indication that in patients aged 65 year@@ s- or when compared to patients aged 65 years of age an increased risk @-@ effective risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age based on non @-@ irrit@@ ability and effectiveness .
clinical trials were necessary in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of &gt; 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment needed to go beyond the dosage adjustment needed for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance from under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver func@@ tioned off from the 1,5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - Grenz@@ wer@@ - and / or Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( at abbrevi@@ ation of liver metastatic ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ based on the upper limit level ( in the presence of liver metastatic ) . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to the expertise of supp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administ@@ ered out of patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phy has once again reached a value of &gt; 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ ism - Cypri@@ ot has once again reached a value of &gt; 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phy speed , th@@ ru@@ ism and maxim@@ ized non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity in the previous treatment cycles - see ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non@@ th@@ ological tox@@ icity such as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was desp@@ ised if a pre @-@ treatment with fol@@ ate acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients must be instruc@@ ted to be treated with pun@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , follow @-@ up and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reducing treatment @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium @-@ in@@ suff@@ iciency ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sali@@ va ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ ls@@ tic ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy to avoid therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is intended to avoid intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ time delay for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred , such risk factors had for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid - accumulation in the trans@@ cell room a dra@@ inage of the therapy before the ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment can be wo@@ unded .
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ers , and zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , when this ingredient is usually administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ de@@ ed life of life ( except yel@@ lo@@ fi@@ eber , this vaccine is non @-@ trained ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible cran@@ i@@ fication of the reproductive tivity is made by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - should be advised to take advice concerning the sper@@ mac@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ logistic@@ s.com ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in higher doses ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) to a decreased pe@@ em@@ ing ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of a multip@@ lication of side effects . &quot;
therefore caution is advisable when in patients with regular kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid is used in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - ac@@ idity in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy which should be avoided on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; since there is no data regarding the intervention potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application needs to be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the scent status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased surveillance frequency from the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Rati@@ o ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for using p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but like an@@ de@@ - and an@@ tim@@ el@@ ites are expected in an application in the pregnancy severe birth defects . &quot;
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if strictly necessary and after careful dis@@ ruption of the user for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible degrad@@ ation of the reproductive @-@ capacity is made by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment of treatment , advice concerning the sperm @-@ spectrum . &quot;
&quot; it is unknown , whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the sti@@ ched baby cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity unwanted effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % by 168 patients with Mes@@ hel@@ hel@@ i@@ om , as well as 163 patients with Mes@@ hel@@ hel@@ i@@ om , which were random@@ ized in cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ o . &quot;

&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I , between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patient relevant weight loss . &quot;

it must not be applied to patients who are treated with cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( for preventing the organ of transpl@@ ant in transpl@@ ant patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in for preventing blood cl@@ auses .
&quot; it must not be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorbed syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are included in the diges@@ tive tract ) , or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers . &quot;
July 2007 the European Commission shared the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited appro@@ ve for the transport of Or@@ li@@ stat G@@ SK throughout the European Union .
alli is a weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I &gt; 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; alli must not be used by children and young people under 18 , since not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , Or@@ li@@ stat is not only slightly res@@ or@@ ised , is at elders and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function not adaptation of the dosage . &quot;
• Over@@ sensitivity to the substance or one of the other components • simultaneous treatment with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Swimming treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of gast@@ ro@@ ast@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase when alli is taken together with a fet@@ ched single @-@ box or fatty nutrition .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes with improved metabo@@ lic control could be , patients who need to consult a medicine against diabetes before beginning a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic must be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
patients who take alli and drugs against hyper@@ tension or increased cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these medicines must be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional vibr@@ ating measures , in order to remedy the possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases , with simultaneous use of Or@@ li@@ stat and Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in was observed a reduction of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in @-@ plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel . &quot;
&quot; when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ li@@ stat , the Quick @-@ Values ( internationally norm@@ ative Rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) might be affected ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , which were treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with Or@@ li@@ stat , the concentr@@ ations of the vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the standardization . &quot;
&quot; however , the patients should be advised to take a suppl@@ ementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vit@@ amine . ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a Ein@@ mal@@ d@@ osis A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers , which at the same time Or@@ li@@ stat has been observed , a low decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on Plas@@ mac@@ a concentration . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of Or@@ li@@ stat are mostly gast@@ ro@@ ast@@ inal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological impact of the drug , since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the gast@@ ro@@ la side effects were obtained from clinical trials with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , are not known ( frequency based on the available data not transfer@@ able ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects , which were observed after the launch of Or@@ li@@ stat is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of certain magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ si@@ bly that the treatment with alli can lead to def@@ enses with regard to potential or actual gast@@ ro@@ and potential side effects .
single d@@ ants of 800 mg Or@@ li@@ stat and multi @-@ compul@@ sory payments of up to 400 mg three times daily were administ@@ ered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight people aged over a period of 15 days with no significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of the cases reported by Or@@ li@@ stat transitions , either side effects or similar effects have been reported in the recommended dose of Or@@ li@@ stat . &quot;
&quot; based on humans on humans and animals can be taken out of a quick back@@ bone system@@ ic effects , which are to the li@@ pass@@ able properties of Or@@ li@@ stat . &quot;
the therapeutic effect is in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper thin w@@ edge due to co@@ ar@@ du@@ ous attachment to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of g@@ astr@@ al and p@@ ank@@ le Li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg Or@@ li@@ stat , taken three times daily , absorption of about 25 % of the food is blocked . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies on adults with a BM@@ I &gt; 28 kg / m2 document the effectiveness of 60 mg Or@@ li@@ stat , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ ched diet daily . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameters , the change of body weight towards the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) was evaluated as follows : as change of body weight in the study ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those studies that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction of 12 months has been observed , the largest weight loss in the first 6 months was observed . &quot;
the average change in total cholester@@ ol@@ in was with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg -@@ 2.9 % ( output value : 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.9 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was compared with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output rating m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; in the circum@@ ference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg ( raw value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) . &quot;

&quot; a permanent weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more movement , the un@@ eas@@ ant diseases can prev@@ ent@@ able and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and get to sleep permanently healthy . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ le , which may also be found as st@@ ating on the packaging of foods . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates , how many calories you should take a maximum of one day . &quot;
&quot; note the data below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat , which you should take with every meal . &quot;
&quot; which amount for you is suitable , take out of the information which is the number of calories available for you . • Under@@ standing the way of the capsule is the compliance of the recommended fats . &quot;
&quot; when you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by keeping the recommended obesity , you can maxim@@ ize the weight loss and at the same time decrease the probability for nutritional defic@@ ien@@ cies . • You should try to increase gradual and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This decreased cal@@ orie intake , it should allow you to gradually lose weight approximately 0,5 kg per week to lose weight without getting frustration and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; low physical activity &quot; means here that you can work daily only little or even down@@ stairs , e.g. at 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to put in realistic cal@@ ory and li@@ abilities and also to adhere to it . • It is useful to make a nutritional log with information about the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Provi@@ ders to move more before you start taking alli .
&quot; the alli program for supporting weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of further information material that can help you feed @-@ cal@@ orie and fatty acids , physically active . &quot;
&quot; in conjunction with one on your type recommended program to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target body . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is applied with chemotherapy for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in Chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are excessive exposure for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as anti @-@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as the effect in this age group does not provide enough information .
&quot; this means that the substance is the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi has been studied in three main studies to 1 8@@ 42 adults , which were chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong or moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are 59 % of patients having been treated with alo@@ xi , in 24 hours after chemotherapy no v@@ om@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , excessive payout for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are 81 % of patients having been treated with alo@@ xi , in 24 hours after chemotherapy no v@@ om@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; with a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
March 2005 the European Commission consul@@ ted the Company &apos;s Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd. for the transport of Alo@@ xi over the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ ces : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting at strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with moderate an@@ af@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi towards prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting which is in@@ duced by a strongly anti @-@ angi@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a before the chemotherapy given cor@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
&quot; as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ dar@@ mp@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nest@@ y ob@@ struc@@ tions or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after inj@@ ecting eng@@ org@@ y . &quot;
&quot; however , with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable to extend with medicines that extend the Q@@ T inter@@ v@@ all or in patients where the Q@@ T interval extends or which tend to be such an extension . &quot;
&quot; apart from the connection with another chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is intended not to be used in the days after chemotherapy nor to the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies inhi@@ bited Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the basis for tum@@ ours of the five examined chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( Cis@@ care@@ atin , Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide , Cy@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
in a clinical trial no significant pharmac@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ - concentration of Met@@ o@@ cl@@ op@@ r@@ ami@@ ds , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in one of a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ ev@@ ine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ din , C@@ im@@ eti@@ din , C@@ im@@ eti@@ din , C@@ im@@ bal , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , coron@@ avi@@ rus , mal@@ tr@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences about applying Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies occur not before , therefore , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant , unless it is considered to be considered . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to ob@@ serving side effects ( overall 633 patients ) , who at least possibly were with Alo@@ xi related to head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity , and reactions at the cost of performance ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in Post @-@ Marketing . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of unwanted events such as in the other Do@@ ors groups ; there were no dose of action to observe . &quot;
&quot; there were no Di@@ aly@@ sis studies , due to the large distribution volume , there is probably no effective therapy in a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized double @-@ ind@@ entation studies were given a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 Cis@@ care@@ at@@ ron , &lt; mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ron and 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , which was given to be intraven@@ ously with no D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ ind@@ entation study , a total of 667 patients , which received a highly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy with 4@@ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , were given to patients who were 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ mark , which were given to us by day 1 . &quot;
results of the studies with moderate @-@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy is summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies on the indication chemotherapy medications and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron would be comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of on@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the clin@@ ician investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the I@@ onic channels and to extend the duration of action potential and to extend the duration of action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted with 221 healthy volunteers , was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single d@@ ants from 0,25 , 0.75 and twenty mg . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift , follows an initi@@ al decrease of the plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ations , a slow eli@@ mination of the body with an average tempor@@ al half @-@ time period of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plas@@ mac@@ on@@ center@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentr@@ ations @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the entire dosage range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer victims .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans , the average sized ( ± SD ) increase between day 1 and day 5 common ( ± SD ) increase of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , that once a daily basis achieved by 0,25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days ; however , the C@@ max after the introduction of 0,75 mg was higher . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % will be eliminated on the kid@@ neys , and some more 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ites , which in comparison with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on the Met@@ abol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in low dimensions , the I@@ so@@ en@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in met@@ abol@@ ism by Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron became found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made as un@@ altered substance , made approximately 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a single intraven@@ ous bol@@ ts in healthy , the overall body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in patients with severe li@@ vi@@ ability dis@@ rup@@ ting the tempor@@ al elimination @-@ time and the average system@@ ic ex@@ position with pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies have been observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered to be sufficiently across the maximum humane treatment , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 from pre@@ clinical trials , evidence indicates that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only be involved in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on channels , which can extend to v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the activity of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose covered in about the 30@@ times of the therapeutic exposure for people ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a multip@@ ly frequency of liver tum@@ ours ( thy@@ ro@@ id , adren@@ al gland ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses and since Alo@@ xi men are determined for single use , the relevance of these results are low as for humans . &quot;

June 2006 the committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expertise in which the authorisation of authorisation for the treatment of hepatitis C is intended for the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C in case of al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ uri@@ ous solution .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is similar to a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same arz@@ an effective part , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; reference sample &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ prolonged ) hepatitis C ( triggered by an viral infection ) .
&quot; a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic analysis shows the liver tissue damage , moreover , the values of the liver en@@ cyclop@@ ae@@ dia Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) will increase in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast into which a gene is taken ( DNA ) , which an@@ fies this to the formation of the drug . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon , set up data that occupy the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug ) , efficacy and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the effectiveness of the reference between 455 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , how many patients were measured after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after hi@@ ring treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is &quot; &quot; for non commercial Pur@@ poses &quot; &quot; for non commercial Pur@@ poses . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , concerns were vo@@ wed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which said to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; after hi@@ ring the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ ers , the disease has been re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated in more patients than at the reference agent ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test was introduced in the study on the investigation of the question , which the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cr@@ ust @-@ depth skin @-@ infection ) and small in@@ duced lad@@ ders ( cr@@ acking or mou@@ ding ) .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not supposed to be used to treat infections that were veri@@ fiable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ide resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this type of infections may not affect .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the age of age should not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient speaks after two or three days not on the treatment , the doctor should examine the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial reef ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
&quot; main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies of the percentage of patients , whose infection disappeared after the end of the treatment . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected H@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ exin @-@ related inci@@ dents : if the results of both studies were taken in front line , about 90 % of the patients of both groups have been taken to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , found that Al@@ tar@@ go has been caused in the treatment of ab@@ st@@ aging ( temporary hol@@ low in body tissues ) or of infections that were veri@@ fiable or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the customer .
&quot; the committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) came to conclude that the advantages of al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial impair@@ ment against the risks outw@@ ei@@ vers : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • un@@ loaded little Laz@@ ations , di@@ ap@@ hr@@ ines , or se@@ wn wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; May 2007 , the European Commission shared the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. for approval of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot;
patients in which no improvement within two or three days should be examined once again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of a awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation by the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be , the treatment has been abandoned , the sal@@ be carefully det@@ ects and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection can be started . &quot;
&quot; ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in should not be applied to the treatment of infections , where MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen , or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies with secondary open wound , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in in patients with infections that were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resist@@ ent St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
&quot; an alternative therapy should be considered , if after one of 2- 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected position occurs . &quot;
&quot; the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ in@@ am@@ ul@@ in and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been tested , and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; due to the low plas@@ mas@@ on@@ cent@@ ric system , which have been achieved during people after top@@ ical application to the di@@ ced skin or infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ or in vi@@ vo not to expect ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; due to the low system@@ ic Ex@@ pos@@ ure after top@@ ical application in patients , Dos@@ age adap@@ tions are not considered to be required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in during a system@@ ic treatment is applied with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
the animal studies have shown a reproduction treatment after oral in@@ ges@@ tion and are inadequate in terms of a statement of effects on the birth and the red@@ dish / post @-@ natural development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
&quot; when deciding whether the stit@@ ching continued / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be completed , the benefit of feeding for the baby and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy is weak@@ ened for the woman . &quot;

the drug mechanism of ret@@ in@@ am@@ ul@@ in is based on selective uni@@ formity of bacterial infection by interaction with a certain binding place of the bacter@@ i@@ ology of the bacter@@ i@@ oms which differs from the bonds of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial fabrics .

&quot; in case the local prevalence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in at least appear certain inf@@ ectivity , should be directed to a consultation by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ in@@ am@@ ul@@ in opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the insulation is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ speaking to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional virus factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ one @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that concern the liver ) in children between one and 15 years that are not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied as part of a two doses of existing vacc@@ ination whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if during the immun@@ isation is a low risk of a hepatitis B infection and is ensured that consisting of two cans of the vacc@@ ination may be led to an end . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desired can be given Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis B vaccine .
vacc@@ inations take effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the virus and surface anti@@ gens as &apos; foreign &apos; and creates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the Twin@@ rix vaccine since 1996 and has been assigned to the Twin@@ rix system since 1997 .
&quot; the three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix will be administ@@ ered in the framework of one of three doses . &quot;
&quot; since Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a sixth month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix led children between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last inj@@ ections on the development of sc@@ em@@ bodi@@ ment against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the level of protection of Ambi@@ rix had similar to a six @-@ month distance and a 12 @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , appeti@@ sers , sor@@ eness , redness , redness , redness and fri@@ ction . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients that may not be applied to the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) not being applied .
August 2002 evaluated the European Commission for G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals - a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the whole world
&quot; the standardization plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose will be administ@@ ered at the date of choice and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ chim@@ ist for hepatitis A is desired as well as hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccines or with a combination of combin@@ ant . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B @-@ virus in@@ ju@@ red after a Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ation ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) -@@ anti@@ body levels are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ants vaccines .
&quot; it is not yet completely secured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons are addressed to a disease vaccine , which require a refres@@ chim@@ ist as protection , since they are also protected by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 . for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction , for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and supervision should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardization is recommended with the combination simp@@ y , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; at Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , after the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ orization may not be achieved after the vacc@@ ination Anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and Anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ antibodies , so that in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ ination may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; as an in@@ tra@@ der@@ mal inj@@ ections or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle can lead to an optimal vacc@@ in@@ victory , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , at Th@@ ro@@ ot@@ cy@@ top@@ ia or blood pressure can Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected to inj@@ uri@@ ed since it can occur in these cases to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gases . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix has been administ@@ ered in the second life year in the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated Pol@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us credits ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or with a combined Mas@@ urian vaccine administ@@ ered , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ otherapy , there must be assumed that there is no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial that was performed with 3 vacc@@ ination of these wor@@ ding in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ro@@ enter@@ i@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccine . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 2029 vaccines have been administ@@ ered by a total of 10@@ 27 vaccine in the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 - including 15 years , toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans of combin@@ ant @-@ combin@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ u@@ ity on a calculation base for a vacc@@ ination candidate , but not on a comp@@ uted basis for each person . &quot;
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.6 % of prob@@ es observed compared to 39,@@ 1 % in the pro@@ pul@@ ling after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ c@@ anned combination .
&quot; after the whole vaccine cycle 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the pro@@ b@@ ahs had administ@@ ered the ambi@@ rix had been administ@@ ered , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % among the pros which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dos@@ - combination . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of matri@@ mon@@ ality was compared to pro @-@ band ( d. h. throughout the whole vaccine at 39,@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ b@@ anden who were given Ambi@@ rix , compared with 36,@@ 2 % among the people who received the 3 @-@ cans combin@@ ant . &quot;
the frequency of pre@@ valent pain and matri@@ mon@@ ality was small and comparable to that which was observed after administration of the combin@@ ant @-@ vaccine with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study with 1@@ - until 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ination was the appearance of local actions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group , comparable with the 3 @-@ cans , which was observed with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; for the 6@@ - until 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was a frequent occurrence of pain ( on the inj@@ ector ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , reported . &quot;

&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was carried out at 12@@ - until 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 cans Ambi@@ rix and 147 got the standard combination simp@@ y with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y was out@@ able , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ter rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dos@@ en@@ im@@ al is significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which have been achieved in a clinical comparison of 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after ending the full vacc@@ ination ( i.e. , month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ination were either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with a combination simp@@ y with 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B @-@ A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
persons who were at the time of vacc@@ ination between 12 and 15 years old could be detected the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and Anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ antibodies for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that which was formed after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination simp@@ y which has been found out of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - until 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ antibodies comparable 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vacc@@ ination is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as by bathing in through waste water contaminated water . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark jungle , a bl@@ ew face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( jel@@ ly ) and other symptoms that may cause a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot be fully protected from an infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B. , even if the whole vaccine has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are infected with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B @-@ virus ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel ) a vaccine may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that are the liver har@@ ming or symptoms , which are similar to those after a Hepatitis monkey or hepatitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express themselves by ju@@ gs rash , respir@@ ation or swelling of the face or tongue . • if you have occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • if you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to quickly have protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the usually planned administration of the second vacc@@ inations ) . &quot;
in a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined share of hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a recur@@ ring hepatitis B surface area ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with decreased content of effective components is usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination prior to completion of the vacc@@ ination .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from individuals who suffer from severe blood@@ thir@@ ties , under the skin and not in the muscle . • if you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a disease or treatment in your own body @-@ own resistance , or if you / your child is under@@ going a cam@@ er@@ aly@@ sis / under@@ go . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Send your doctor if you / your child take more medicine / take ( including those that have been administ@@ ered without delay ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( si@@ RNA ) have been administ@@ ered / or this is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not adequate and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limb@@ s .
&quot; if ambitions are administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be adequate . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be administ@@ ering or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent to vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which have been known since issu@@ ing the first approval for the transport system , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefits @-@ risk for Ambi@@ rix will remain positive . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix has been placed on transport only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over one month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium co@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ centr@@ centr@@ ations ) in pre @-@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ite is divided - split by several p@@ ants to meals - cur@@ ly , under the food mixed or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ und ( through the pancre@@ as in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose @-@ son@@ de ( through the nose in the stomach of leading bottles ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared to any other treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a head@@ lamp medicine , i.e. without any substance ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to appeti@@ te loss , a ab@@ norm@@ ality in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , ti@@ less@@ ness , nau@@ sea , des@@ per@@ ation , nau@@ sea , failure , rash , in@@ pleas@@ ing body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) have led to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high levels of ammon@@ ite are effectively prevented .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; because due to the rar@@ ity of the illness at the time of approval there was limited information on this medicine . &quot;
the use is indic@@ ted in all patients where a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel is already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born age ( within the first 28 life @-@ days ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fold form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , which manifes@@ ts after the first life of life , there is an indication of the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic En@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to sw@@ allow tablets or for patients with be@@ u@@ ck@@ disorders is AM@@ MON@@ APS also available in gran@@ ule form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose will be individually calculated according to the protein ance , and for the growth and development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake . &quot;
&quot; after the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
patients suffering from a premature lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ trans@@ b@@ oul@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ ings or argin@@ ine in a dosage by 0.3 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with an argin@@ ine c@@ app@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase @-@ lack must be argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ APS tablets may not be administ@@ ered by patients with sl@@ u@@ ties , since there is a risk for the origin of the E@@ soph@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
each tablet AM@@ MON@@ APS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium - according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g Nat@@ ri@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MON@@ APS , therefore , should be applied to patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney suff@@ iciency , as well as with so@@ dium re@@ tention , and eco @-@ formation in particular with caution . &quot;
&quot; since Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at about the liver and the kid@@ neys occurs , AM@@ MON@@ APS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency only with extreme caution . &quot;
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS during pregnancy is therefore non @-@ trained ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high doses ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slo@@ wing of ne@@ ural multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; it also took a dev@@ oti@@ ation of distor@@ tion syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functioning nerve damage in the brain , and thus a disability of brain growth . &quot;
&quot; it could not be noticed whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is dischar@@ ged in humans into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS is un@@ trained during stagn@@ ation time ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials of AM@@ MON@@ APS , at least 56 % of patients stood at least an unwanted event ( AE ) at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and in 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MON@@ APS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ APS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ab@@ etic patient , which developed a metabo@@ lic termin@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ e@@ azi@@ ebox , hem@@ og@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ erer N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose came at a 5 month old babies with a mixed single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed for a intraven@@ ous administration of cans of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity showed .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabo@@ lic active connection that con@@ ju@@ red by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine con@@ ju@@ amine that is sign@@ posted over the kid@@ neys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore ideal as an alternative de@@ hydr@@ ation of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the urine cycle can be accepted that for every gram so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0,12 and 0,@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
&quot; it is important that the diagnosis is early on and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival progn@@ osis and the clinical results . &quot;
the progn@@ osis of the early mani@@ pulation form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms of the new@@ born age has almost always inf@@ li@@ zed and the disease conducted even during treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al cat@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ ck@@ le @-@ free an@@ alogue within the first quarter of life . &quot;
&quot; by tick @-@ analysis , the exploitation of altern@@ ate paths of nit@@ rogen emissions ( so@@ dium eth@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , so@@ dium ben@@ zo@@ at and nat@@ ri@@ dium amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rates of new @-@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) diagnosed in 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ite c@@ ephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many for intellectual disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fold form of the disease ( including female patients with the heter@@ ozy@@ g@@ ous form of Or@@ ni@@ th@@ trans@@ b@@ ah@@ am@@ yl@@ ase @-@ deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ ite im@@ pedi@@ atric and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly any rever@@ sible and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
&quot; it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is ox@@ i@@ ded to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is manufactured in liver and kidney enzy@@ me with glut@@ amine con@@ ju@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created . &quot;
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and his met@@ abol@@ ites in Plas@@ ma and Ur@@ in were determined according to gifts of a single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber flow and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeti@@ tive g@@ ging of or@@ al cans of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ y@@ at and his met@@ abol@@ ites also was examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous gift from Nat@@ ri@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ men &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood sugar to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ abil@@ ic Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ers ( cardi@@ ac measurement for electro@@ cardi@@ og@@ ram or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; if an@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the prevention of blood vessels in patients applying to a PCI , a higher dose is administ@@ ered and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or coron@@ ary heart to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; about 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox inj@@ ectors / II@@ IA @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drugs for preventing blood cl@@ auses ) with the conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI the patient is often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery , to prevent a decision to prevent cl@@ asp ) , and they received additionally other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ auses , such as abor@@ tion and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift from G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( death cases , coron@@ ary cases or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year a total of just as effective as the usual treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who have been subjected to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for serious ble@@ eding in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other she@@ et@@ ine or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied to patients who have recently had a blood , as well as in people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney disease or a heart infection . &quot;
the committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission of The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd shared a licence for the transport of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ant@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ mid@@ ator ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) at an emergency access or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of angi@@ ox by patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of .@@ mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is conducted in another episode , an additional bolt should be given up to 0.5 mg / kg and increases the inf@@ usion for the duration of the entry to 1,75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
after the PCI may be taken after clinical conditions the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a circulation of 0.5 mg / kg is administ@@ ered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ oplast@@ y . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox by patients with a PCI is provided by a initi@@ als of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation .
the safety and effectiveness of a single bolt from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value is shor@@ tened ( ACT by 5 minutes ) to below 225 seconds , should be shor@@ tened to a second bolt of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance lower ACT , the re@@ ation and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully defined before applying and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis should be given intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , another control is no longer required , provided the 1,75 mg / kg Inf@@ usi@@ ons@@ d@@ osis is administ@@ ered correctly . &quot;
&quot; with patients with moderate ren@@ al functionality ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,@@ 4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is among 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis is to be administ@@ ered by 0,@@ 3 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with moderate levels , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) included in the ACT number 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without tin @-@ customiz@@ able by an average of 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 At patients with severe kidney disease ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients is an@@ gi@@ ox inj@@ ected ( see under section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be used 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous gift of non @-@ frac@@ tional Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of burnt @-@ cou@@ mar@@ in .

patients may be monitored during the treatment carefully with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood pressure especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in combined with an other anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans is administ@@ ered ( see section 4.5 ) .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was found in the application in combination with an effective insul@@ in in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body can produce no insul@@ in in two studies with a total of 1 370 adults and a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body insul@@ in is not eff@@ ected effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ ost@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , after six months a lowering of 0.7 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.7 % at insul@@ in l@@ is@@ pro . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was reduced % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,30 % in human regul@@ insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insul@@ in l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients suffering already in hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adapted when it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glu@@ co@@ gs .
September 2004 shared the European Commission of San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH to get approval of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is considered sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting either in the area of the abdom@@ inal , surface or del@@ ay@@ ment , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous inf@@ usion to the field of pancre@@ as . &quot;
&quot; due to the decrease of gl@@ uc@@ t@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ished insul@@ in resource , the insul@@ in need to be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the real strength , the brand ( Her@@ - writer ) , the insul@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ c@@ del@@ ayed etc . ) , the type of insul@@ in ( animal insul@@ in ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insul@@ in need . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or the break@@ age of a treatment , in particular in patients with a insul@@ in @-@ type diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ wer ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
changing a patient to another insul@@ in type or insul@@ in another producer should take place under str@@ ingent medical supervision and may make a change of dosage required .
the time of occurrence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the drug profile of the used insul@@ in and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; these substances , which can increase ble@@ eding activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ ine , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Conver@@ ting enzy@@ mes , fi@@ br@@ ate , hydro@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , cy@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ ide , sal@@ ic@@ ide and sul@@ ph@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ iz@@ tics such as sc@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine @-@ regulation will be lo@@ wered or absent . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies on reproduction treatment showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ insul@@ in regarding the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post @-@ natural development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insul@@ in ul@@ is@@ le enters into the human breast milk , but generally occurs insul@@ in neither to the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ised upon oral application . &quot;
&quot; in the following , most of the clinical trials are listed , group@@ ed by system bodies and ordered according to decre@@ asing the frequency of their occurrence ( very frequently : &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000

studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ al of insul@@ in ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency occurs faster and the average duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal insul@@ in .
&quot; in a study with 18 male individuals at the age of 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 @-@ diabetes mel@@ ting , insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic effect of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg is a dis@@ proportionate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ity effect , and with 0.3 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportionate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ity effect , just like human@@ ities . &quot;
insul@@ in l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast effect as normal human insul@@ in and achiev@@ es the complete glu@@ co@@ dium effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insul@@ in .
&quot; the data was obvious that in an application of insul@@ in l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal is achieved a comparable @-@ ran@@ quit@@ ous gly@@ cem@@ ic control , such as with human shelf insul@@ in , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
