<seg id="9">"patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, which are exactly as Abilify, should be adapted to the dose of Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by the neurotransmitters, i.e. chemical substances which allow communication of nerve cells among each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is thought to be mainly known as "partite agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also serotonin is called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripibzol like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in low dimensions than the neurotransmitter affects the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, it contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and their reoccur will be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, the reemergence of symptoms, has been studied in three trials over up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection-solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that compared to increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was stabilised over twelve weeks on 347 patients with semi-placebo, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that have been stabilised to 160 patients where the manic symptoms have already been stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection-solution was taken in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that compared to increased unrest (an other antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>

<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection-solution showed patients, the Abilify in doses of 25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significant stronger reduction in symptoms increased unrest as patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder decreased Abilify in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks long, more effective than placebo the reemergence of recurring episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg-cans also decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to capture (observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapPyramidale interference (uncontrollable), breaking, nausea (sojourn), fatigue, nausea (burning), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnie (sleeping disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the committee on human therapeutic agents (CHMP) have led to the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia, as well as in prevention of a new manical episode in patients who reported mostly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes have to address with Aripidazol, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee also came to the result that the benefits of injection-solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia, or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder, if a oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>

<seg id="53">"if you consider the common gift from Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4-Inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors by CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV-proteasers, seem to have similar effects and therefore similar Dosage reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors the dosage should be raised by ABILIFY to the tin-level before the beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>

<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi towards prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly anti-angiogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a before the chemotherapy given corcosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"as Palonosetron can prolong the coldarmpage, patients should be monitored with anamnesty obstructions or signs of a subacute Ileus after injecting engorgy."</seg>
<seg id="2620">"however, with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable to extend with medicines that extend the QT intervall or in patients where the QT interval extends or which tend to be such an extension."</seg>
<seg id="2621">"apart from the connection with another chemotherapy, Aloxi is intended not to be used in the days after chemotherapy nor to the treatment of nausea and vomiting."</seg>
<seg id="2622">"in clinical studies inhibited Palonosetron did not inhibit the basis for tumours of the five examined chemotherapeutics (Ciscareatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cyxorubicin and Mitomycin C)."</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial no significant pharmacinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-stat- concentration of Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6-Inhibitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2624">"in one of a population-based pharmacinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6-Inhievine, Cimetidin, Cimetidin, Cimetidin, Cimbal, paroxetine, coronavirus, maltravir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the clearance of Palonosetron."</seg>
<seg id="2625">"experiences about applying Palonosetron in human pregnancies occur not before, therefore, Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant, unless it is considered to be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observing side effects (overall 633 patients), who at least possibly were with Aloxi related to headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%)."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of oversensitivity, and reactions at the cost of performance (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in Post-Marketing."</seg>
<seg id="2628">"in the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies of unwanted events such as in the other Doors groups; there were no dose of action to observe."</seg>
<seg id="2629">"there were no Dialysis studies, due to the large distribution volume, there is probably no effective therapy in a Aloxi- overdose."</seg>
<seg id="2630">"in two randomized double-indentation studies were given a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emogenic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 Ciscareatron, &lt; mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Doxorubron and 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours), which was given to be intravenously with no Dexamethasone."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"in a randomized double-indentation study, a total of 667 patients, which received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with 460 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, were given to patients who were 32 mg of Ondanmark, which were given to us by day 1."</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate-ogenous chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy is summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"in clinical studies on the indication chemotherapy medications and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron would be comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the QTc intervalls with the corresponding effects of onsetron and Dolasetron."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"according to the clinician investigations, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the Ionic channels and to extend the duration of action potential and to extend the duration of action potential."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"the aim of the study conducted with 221 healthy volunteers, was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.v. administered Palonosetron in single dants from 0,25, 0.75 and twenty mg."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"resorption After intravenous gift, follows an initial decrease of the plasmakoncentrations, a slow elimination of the body with an average temporal half-time period of about 40 hours."</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasmaconcenteration (Cmax) and the area under the concentrations-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional to the entire dosage range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer victims.</seg>
<seg id="2638">"according to intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans, the average sized (± SD) increase between day 1 and day 5 common (± SD) increase of Palonosetron-Plasmaconcentration at 42 ± 34%."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"from pharmacopoinetic simulations, that once a daily basis achieved by 0,25 mg Palonosetron reached 3 consecutive days; however, the Cmax after the introduction of 0,75 mg was higher."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"approximately 40% will be eliminated on the kidneys, and some more 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison with Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor."</seg>
<seg id="2641">"in-vitro studies on the Metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, in low dimensions, the Isoenme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in metabolism by Palonosetron."</seg>
<seg id="2642">"Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron became found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron made as unaltered substance, made approximately 40% of the given dose."</seg>
<seg id="2643">"after a single intravenous bolts in healthy, the overall body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"in fact, in patients with severe liviability disrupting the temporal elimination-time and the average systemic exposition with pallonosetron, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"clinical studies have been observed only after expositions which are considered to be sufficiently across the maximum humane treatment, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"10 from preclinical trials, evidence indicates that Palonosetron can only be involved in very high concentrations of Ion channels, which can extend to ventricular de- and Repolarisation and extend the activity of action."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"high doses of Palonosetron (each dose covered in about the 30times of the therapeutic exposure for people), which were given daily over two years, led to a multiply frequency of liver tumours (thyroid, adrenal gland) and skin tumors in rats, but not with mice."</seg>
<seg id="2648">"the underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high doses and since Aloxi men are determined for single use, the relevance of these results are low as for humans."</seg>
