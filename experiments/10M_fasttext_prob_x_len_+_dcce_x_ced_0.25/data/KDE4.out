package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; doing these easier now .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select settings , open the map tools and select the desired modules there . &quot;
&quot; this is a partial list of default modules from the package k@@ de , add@@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; includes before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or the list of stor@@ my , if present , delete . &quot;
the module Acc@@ ept@@ filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extr@@ as An@@ chor@@ filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s up@@ dat@@ able working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M builder in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , choose Extr@@ as DO@@ M tree Show ... and therefore open a new window with the DO@@ M the straight web page . as a default , the ad starts with the root node of the document , example : wireless element , all other knots are sub@@ elements of this root canal . &quot;
&quot; the module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for a further view of objects with the M@@ IME @-@ type I@@ node / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbols and text views , in order to view the content of your local fil@@ es@@ ystem . &quot;
&quot; the partic@@ ular@@ ity of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists in defining the folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map graphi@@ cally . all object is depic@@ ted by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . therefore , big files , even then can be easily detected , as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; F@@ S@@ View , is an entry in the Tre@@ ch representation of a rect@@ angle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . for easy navigation , you own the right edge of meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the colour of a rect@@ angle , which is switched through colour mode , can be either depth for the light detection of the sp@@ elling camera or the illustration of a different file peculi@@ ar such as name , owner , group or m@@ ime type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ elled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature you may specify , if enough space to display is present or if the area of subordin@@ ates are present only ) . furthermore , you can define the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; Dar@@ setup algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be respected , that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ per@@ in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; this goal is not always respected . there is a frame drawn to show the sli@@ pping of the entries , and this framework require space , which is lost then the subordin@@ ate entries . note that there is less space for the frame when the rect@@ angle square is square . &quot;
&quot; as spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation remains to be left . here it is for the lab@@ elled and to prevent space loss by frames always beneficial to the areas that are as quadr@@ atic as possible . the best methods for this are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive secondary division . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal booked area for an entry over the menu item view , which instead , instead , a rob@@ bery @-@ pattern is drawn into the surface of the transm@@ itter entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ um . &quot;
the picture image gallery will be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extr@@ as picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; once you call the image gallery , a dialog will open up with which you can define the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option names of the page allows you to adjust in a text box to adjust the title of the picture gallery page .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a script to adjust the number of mini@@ pictures in each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the cross @-@ name fil@@ en@@ ame of the picture , you &apos;ll see if the fil@@ en@@ ame in the gallery will display in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ field file size of the picture , you &apos;ll see if the file size is displayed among the images in the gallery . &quot;
with the cross @-@ ring image size you &apos;ll see if the size of images below the images is displayed in the gallery .
&quot; in the dialog folder , you determine where the gallery will be stored and which sub@@ folders will be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection , save into HTML file , enter where the HTML @-@ page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the cross@@ breeds sub@@ folder you can set up with a sli@@ der or a turning point , up to what level the sub @-@ folder are included . &quot;
&quot; with the cin@@ emas original images , you &apos;ll put sure whether the original images should be copied into the gallery . &quot;
with the crossing the commentary box you can use a comm@@ ent@@ file for descri@@ bing the images in the gallery .
&quot; in the cross @-@ field of sel@@ fish colour , you can indicate a different colour @-@ view over the original images in the original images . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extr@@ as HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser may be defined here :

&quot; an easy to use camera interface will be available to you to connect with your digital camera and your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ tization . of course , each medium and any maps , which is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tization ; contains a quick image processing with basic imaging tools . you can use this to review your photos , comment and correc@@ ting . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ tization , easy to use is made available professional skills available . it works fully in the 16 @-@ bit Far@@ br@@ aum and all available modules support the raw converted by li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC @-@ colour management - work@@ flow . &quot;
improved database with much more met@@ ad@@ ata as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens can be sear@@ ched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs also comes &amp; digi@@ tization ; an open source project . that means it &apos;s on the support of the end users . you should therefore get problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; tries to make the mil@@ king of problems or improvement suggestions as easily as possible for them . this opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . this opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&quot; &amp; Pres@@ sure ; is a project supported by a community . i.e. , users and developers arrived to each other . if you would like to come to other users of &amp; digi@@ tization , we would like to answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ tization . in this mailing list , you would like to answer any questions of other users . in this mailing list , you should already be spoken in English , you should therefore be power@@ fully aware of this language . &quot;
you can also check the digi@@ tization ; homepage to visit news about fre@@ ed versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; the best start to get involved in &amp; digi@@ tization , is the registration in the developer mailing list . instruction to login in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; when you come and start ; for the first time , you will be asked where you can store your images and your database . you can select a local , remote or remote folder , or click the folder symbol folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data collection is stored . this path remains the same for all the images . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folder as you want . &amp; digi@@ tization : will you use additional as Al@@ ben@@ Library . settings Pres@@ sure Coll@@ ections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images , as a base folder . no picture is seen as album . no picture will be changed . during the browsing of the folder you will get a progress display like this : &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tization ; dur@@ ous@@ y searches the libr@@ arian in all of its depth . you can &apos;t shut up a sub@@ folder ; unless there is i@@ ste in hiding folder . this allows you to suit your de@@ bs &amp; digi@@ tization ; take a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will not take photos as symbols . you can take the change by using any photo taken out of the album and this will be used as a symbol symbol . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you configured the base folder , you can set in &amp; check ; your digital camera up . after that you should learn how to use My albums and my key@@ word to manage your photos into the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw materials : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so you can get . possibly the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , so you can find a list of supported raw material cameras in the menu Help . &quot;
how you set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ w Dec@@ o@@ der@@ settings and Ro@@ h work@@ flows .
&quot; an easy to use camera interface will be available to you to connect with your digital camera and your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ tization . of course , each medium and any maps , which is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
modern digital cameras are registered with the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the interface can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also be used under the connection to the seri@@ ousness Port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses the program g@@ photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which has been designed for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to machines and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transmission through the seri@@ ousness Port are slow , this connection has now been de@@ prec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports these cameras and introduces the transfer of pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link .
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must be created with li@@ bex@@ if support , so that the press @-@ makers will not be able to read from some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 com@@ rade . if the P@@ KK support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be mist@@ aken or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ tization is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules : the KDE image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common modu@@ l@@ structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to supplement &amp; digi@@ tization ; by writing a small module around a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ tization came ; themselves perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + . &quot;
&quot; that pul@@ ling and place of images works everywhere , you can place an image in another part of the alarm system , using the horizontal partition line or another application window . the only limitation is that a picture is not in keywords , data list or searches . &quot;
&quot; - a file @-@ specific selection allows you to highlight the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ w , Films and Audio
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields , which is now displayed in the symbolic view . thus , the fil@@ tering is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind it is displayed as the symbol@@ ise . which fields are shown you can configure in the dialog of the setting @-@ settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; presents an organized view on your phot@@ ovoltai@@ c pages . these albums are stored according to the folders , where they are stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date , on which the album was first written to be sorted . the date can be changed to the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you set up a scanner , you can scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a screenshot directly to an album , select the screenshot of the screenshot . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from an album to another , you can drag the photo to the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu , you &apos;ll have to move on the same type also several pictures and copy it . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album includes a collection of photos and the album features , allowing you to list information on this collection . to click on the album features , you must click on the album right click on the album and select the menu tab . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method of highlight your records , so that you can choose from a common name by selecting the tool@@ bar , if you want to add or delete new collections in your collection . if you want to add new collections , you can make it in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used if you sort your albums by date with View albums sort by date .
&quot; buttons el@@ der , average , neu@@ ester : these set the date on the one of the oldest , the new image or the portion of the album . this will first tries to calculate the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file can be used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first came to an album &amp; digi@@ tization , the first image of the album was chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is to help you to remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first photo is not representative of the album and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; text@@ menu &amp; quot ; As &quot; &quot; Alb@@ um@@ et@@ schau &quot; &quot; . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be c@@ ited .
&amp; Pres@@ sure ; supports the input of key@@ word for individual photos in the field of my key@@ word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection always includes all the pictures of the album . of course you can use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the window display . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of these curtains with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time you &apos;ll briefly wait , while the pre @-@ looking pictures are generated . this allows you to avoid where you can re@@ generate all previous pictures in the menu Extr@@ as . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be shown below the preview preview . what information this is , you can change about settings ; set up here . select the albums page and adjust the range of images to suit your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the Th@@ umb@@ nails have help patterns , the mar@@ g@@ s. if you let the mouse c@@ ursor a moment over an image . the help displays the most important features including all of the photos . the screenshot displays the screenshot above in the main window and shows such a help window . &quot;
photos are all done by doing it at &amp; digi@@ tization . albums and tags allow you to organise your pictures as it suits you . the picture editing shows your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements in the menu bar . you can have the choice between the view of the images , a sli@@ deshow or the editing of images . &quot;
you can open the image processing with a photo by clicking on either F@@ 4 picture ... or the context menu of the picture with right mouse button and editing ... in the section title ; picture editing you will find a guide to how you can edit your photos and edit them .
&quot; it may occur that &amp; digi@@ tization ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo to a different program by selecting the context menu , and how to adjust these your needs if your program is not en@@ umer@@ ated , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that it may happen after the processing by other imaging programs to problems with the related met@@ ad@@ ata . some programs do not save this data , if you saved the altered image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , bl@@ ending , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pres@@ sure , there is two options available for rotation . the simpl@@ est is to click on the P@@ review and click on . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the P@@ review and click F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . please note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you come a photo from &amp; digi@@ tization , delete , it will be moved to the M@@ ül@@ men of &amp; k@@ de ; postp@@ oned . f@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Dis@@ f Falls you prefer to delete yourself , you can use this by using Shift ; discharge . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ st@@ quot ; organized your photos by using the data . &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses either the EX@@ IF @-@ Date or if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; when you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et below in the Dat@@ um@@ ber view , so that you can only see the photos of the chosen days . &quot;
photos with key@@ ed handles provide a flexible and powerful opportunity to organize your photos and cat@@ alo@@ ise . tags are sti@@ ckers to be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word was assigned a photo , the photo can be found through the selection of this key@@ word or search . &quot;
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all photos that have been highlighted with this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . through this , you can also organize your tags . you can also fold pieces of the tree &amp; quot ; My Stich@@ ting t@@ li@@ bite ; so you can find the Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : so you can find the keywords which you &apos;re looking for , easily find . &quot;
&quot; the tags are stored in a database for fast access and added key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also use your tags in other programs . moreover , the tags are imported to the loss of the database once &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the pictures noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new tags by clicking with the right mouse button either to &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot; &quot; button ; or to an existing key@@ word , after you click on an existing key@@ word , after you cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , this becomes the per@@ plex@@ ity of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking the key@@ word with right mouse button and delet@@ ing . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself is not deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a key@@ word by moving it to the desired location in the tree and drop it off . then , a menu that gives you the possibility to drag the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in the tree . &quot;
&quot; you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button , and edit in the context menu . you can edit the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My Stich@@ wor@@ m@@ quot ; change . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as an album menu . additionally you can draw the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to take &amp; digi@@ tization ; s functionality connect with key@@ word to use , you must first select your photos with key@@ word . alternatively , you can click on the appropriate key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot; &quot; button . alternatively , you can also click on the opposite of the pictures and select from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a photo with any number of tags . the photo will appear once you choose one key@@ word of the keywords , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was done etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have made a photo with key@@ word , this is shown below the preview of the picture in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word on which you can open the context menu of the photo , and select from the tags menu . the menu will show you only the tags you have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the contem@@ plate view indicates a time @-@ dependent hist@@ og@@ ram of the number of images per unit . a selection framework can select on this hist@@ og@@ ram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame . thus all related images are displayed in the main window . &quot;
in the bottom box you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; cover all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dates , dates and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ ula to search box is a small lamp is the green if the search takes place . if you click here , the fil@@ tering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search doesn &apos;t have found , then the lamp will be red . &quot;
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side@@ bar with the tel@@ esc@@ ope . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can always watch this search here as a search crit@@ erion . after you saved it being saved as a search crit@@ erion . after you saved it &apos;s filter in the list .
&quot; when you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be done . the results will be displayed in the main window . if you want to change your request a name into My search list , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in the context menu . &quot;

&quot; if you want to delete an existing search out of the list , select in the context menu menu . &quot;
&quot; the Exten@@ ded Search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules will be used to add the options for a search query in the Alb@@ ite database . any option can be added , delete or deleted . each option can be added with others through the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... moreover , you can create ho@@ oks of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , hair algorith@@ m . this allows to compare images by compar@@ ing these sig@@ natur@@ es . the lower the difference between two images , the more correspond to them . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar one . by means of a pig @-@ a@@ erts the result is increased or shr@@ inks . if you move a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the un@@ used search in the left side@@ bar then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : post@@ cards : draw a fast sketch and &amp; Pres@@ sure ; find the appropriate images . also here can be a pig @-@ value .
&quot; this rider is available for intuitive maps based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature program . you can push the mouse button with the mouse wheel or push it and move . move it while you are fil@@ tered with the mouse button . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires the image of your images of Ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Ge@@ o @-@ folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pres@@ sure , provides a lumin@@ ous in a separate window available with which you simply can compare pictures . he works with all supported image data formats , also raw files , together . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em illumin@@ ate from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ ous menu and its window opened . if you come back in &amp; Pres@@ sure , main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ ance with L Extr@@ as lumin@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; from the Vor@@ umb@@ nails , you can compare the images that you want to compare in the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow shows you to see which copy in which window area is to be seen . you can also compare it with the other image . you can therefore compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to copy quickly from a picture series . if you want to navigate pa@@ ar@@ wise from the tool@@ bar , then use the left mouse button on any pattern of view to display it in the right area . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal li@@ abilities work directly from the lumin@@ ance like F@@ 4 file &quot;
&quot; all imaging information from the right side bar of the main window have been available for both view@@ points in the lighthouse , e.g. simply visual differences with illumin@@ ating data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each area you find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , you must recognize them at the crossed arrows . to keep the visible area of the picture . in the mode P@@ review will be pressed . in the mode P@@ review will show both images of the same image range . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the z@@ oom controls among the images or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to enter into the image and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures when you are preview in the mode P@@ review .
&quot; what is a digital component management - away from the fashion ? digital component management views each part of the process after the picture has been taken up to the final edition and the permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ ans or digital photos , however , does not make a form of digital component management . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect , protect and use photos . we consider the downloading , remove , evaluate , group@@ ing , optim@@ ised , optim@@ ised , maintain , maintain and export of images . &quot;
&quot; digital components participate in , indi@@ ces , categ@@ orized , ensures that searches , transform@@ ers , conf@@ ection@@ able , and exports content that have a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data of data . met@@ ad@@ ata are provided according to your definition data that will provide information about or a documentation of other data that will be managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you can find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you do , then use your met@@ ad@@ ata to save very fast search and secure archiving to which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you have to do and know before you need anything into your system , the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . you have to decide whether other access to your photos may want to save it on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; take note that you will have to change on a greater drive sometime . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . accommodations can be found quickly about your location , unless you stayed in a year several times at the same place . if you do enough photos , you will be sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant immigration of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % of work files will not want to re@@ organise your structure for these contents . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the p@@ ile processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simplify a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an ex@@ pi@@ red image .
&quot; we also highly recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata ad@@ ata in the setup page of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ tization . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file , then you can select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which is to change ? make them a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work , as you should now indicate each photo key@@ word , compl@@ ementary and evaluation . of course , you can select all pictures that may need the same attribute and then set the value . you &apos;ll start best with the rating or the ranking . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let us now use key@@ word , key literally , as with other programs often called hot , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
if you import cat@@ alo@@ orized images from a different source with built @-@ embedded use then &amp; digi@@ tization ; automatically insert the tree for you build b@@ z@@ w the images to the right place . the modified key@@ word are made by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. updated while the under@@ trees are tr@@ acked .
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ l@@ apped . this is a very rough representation , as each block of met@@ ad@@ ata is made in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ame and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the key@@ word - the next section refers to signs , or comments , the third important tool for your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want to let most anyone want to see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in getting your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from a distance not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is present . Wow ! one starts to dream , remin@@ is@@ ations , the historical time span has been present again ; you might even listen to the silence . the cap@@ tion therefore has completely changed your perception of this panor@@ amas . &quot;
for others who consider your photos is the title possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest . remember the key is it the importance of viewer to transfer Him through the motive which you moved has to understand what you understand .
it is fine when an image is not perfect if it &apos;s the strength to have only one cap@@ tion for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ tization , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE will provide you with your wishes into cap@@ tion and / or the title of the Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? what would you like to find in a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth ? good , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already starts with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to use the ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization can already be unt@@ apped and will be able to start more deeply in the future . I can also export your traveling with Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth . you can also export the photos at the reception area . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Maps spect@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; copy@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and describes the practice the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms are also in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the furnishings page of &amp; digi@@ tization has to be depos@@ ited as information :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for writer and author ) : this field should add your name , or use the name of the photographer , for example if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization should not be changed . this field does not support Kom@@ mas or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on as divi@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for fi@@ bers ) : associated with the author . examples may be the work@@ book of the photographer . examples for this can be titles as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent Phot@@ ograph . as this is a note about the author &apos;s field , it must be filled out . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily be the author . if the photographer has been listed for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here . if the photo is a stock photo , then the image / agency offers the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against mis@@ use . each of which has a little more than basic met@@ ad@@ ata , delete or change the solution for the majority of your photos . for individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi@@ professional pros this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ tization ; will provide such a module for p@@ ile processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : PL@@ AT@@ TEN@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , disk power , ECC , transmission errors , aging of storage , recovery , redund@@ ancy , condition , temperature , widespread super@@ sti@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that could happen on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen with traditional paper pictures or negative . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery firm in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs this must be treated and you can no longer keep your CDs and DVDs in archives . naturally , you can also get CDs and DVDs in archives . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it lies in your jud@@ g@@ alley . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ ks and good accessibility . the best DVD recording are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you are writing a lot of reliable . it is thus about the right to select . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you have just been written only . that &apos;s why we use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . despite this massive protection they are needed for form@@ atting , ul@@ avi@@ olet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster the apparently miracle of CDs and DVDs . it also runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged dis@@ ks , hard@@ disk , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray dis@@ ks seem to win the For@@ mat@@ ing against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and therefore it has been said almost six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . it is also true for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
&quot; after reading this , you slowly burn with a good recording at high quality media in a non @-@ exclusive format . also check out the media with a description , date &amp; author no@@ du@@ es and then on animals protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ cs reserve your statistics for itself . your manufacturing processes include a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study about the error mechanisms by hard drives : dis@@ car@@ ving study &quot;
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks stop at the longest when you are operated in temper@@ ament range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . these errors are the most common fault of error , S@@ MAR@@ T may not determine this bug . some of S@@ MAR@@ T fixed errors will announce the expected situation amounts to between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only about the complete loss due to over@@ power supply . of course , you can also have data loss due to a current event before you secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without great problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices are not going to do so much , that can cause heavy chips and high @-@ speed processors , these can cause serious damage , hardware @-@ age , non @-@ break@@ age , destru@@ c@@ tible mother@@ boards and other defects . therefore , protect yourself prior to the avoidable result of a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most widespread protection against Strom@@ ness is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that portion of the energy heat absor@@ b@@ ed and the rest is ground@@ ed . however it is usually available in the form of an plug @-@ in . remember that not every socket also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care of which he protects protection against light@@ ning bolt and thus protects the right connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ load of any cable can use on your machine , you should be careful that also all the periph@@ er@@ als are connected to your system . some manufacturers provide an over@@ voltage connection for your mo@@ dem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore contain the protection for the mo@@ dem . this means you are ideal for traveling . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection can protect your system against smaller variations in the power lines , it will help you with a complete hair loss . even a failure of a few seconds may result in loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful in inter@@ rup@@ ture free power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection against over@@ voltage movements , these devices can automatically supply cordless energy . this gives you the opportunity to store your data and to run the system . in addition , you should be sure to keep the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the life @-@ time of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare his security in electricity disorders , with costs to prevent this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you &apos;re thinking about how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should think about getting all the cables before you go to the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store this as a backup target for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data . &quot;
&quot; they are very expensive compared to the hard@@ disk , however , very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; a dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send data about compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general security solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; your free store is available on photos online , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com . the professional version will not provide you with more photos , in case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you &apos;ll get un@@ restricted memory which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data protection , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically generated thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the large companies in the offer of a backup and a distribution of storage . thus they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ secure . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission range in machines . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody is telling you when a transmission error occurred . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection to one day . nobody seems to have no protection for it . nobody seems to have thought on it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that inside your computer .
&quot; un@@ reliable power components are a further source for transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ viewer in the data flows . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission issues , you should look to the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of errors each year . &quot;
Z@@ FS by Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with turn@@ out at low levels and is available under one of the GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ ational file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanism used and is available for Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % for job systems . at Not@@ ebooks is already the proportion of the theft .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the most masters . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or rein@@ st@@ ony . and it is currently only limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under Linux ; however , no longer has been si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travel F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the investig@@ ating process during an operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ able status will be avoided . if a file has not been completely stored before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; from digital cameras , 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings are removed from fundamental physical borders , is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural fron@@ tier for this progress . sensitivity and pre@@ dat@@ ors for all kinds of light sensors are no longer a far away from this border . &quot;
&quot; today , cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ api@@ xel cameras and the end result is rather deterior@@ ated . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality optics , the optimum size for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras require a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard disk is available today for 100 &amp; euro ; therefore , do not provide any other for data loss . so you can make your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make any inci@@ dents like the rein@@ st@@ allation of your OS , exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your view@@ ings on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a bolt suggests you are lucky when the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air conditioning : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are hazardous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vation always means a non @-@ storage storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring building , into your office or a similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another benefit of physical separation : as above it is said one more common reason for a backup loss despite secure the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , you can save one day . &quot;
&quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files is to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot of a history , and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot;
&quot; difference insurance : a backup of the files has been changed since the last complete security . this creates a complete snap@@ shot of two time points : the complete security , and the final difference . &quot;
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it creates the original status to each time to restore such a backup .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmis@@ sions copied r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this is com@@ pressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
ensure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer for a DVD or another visual medium .
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to detect losses and restore it . at the same time , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . each further ej@@ ection should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , origin@@ ates , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ find images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... &quot;
&quot; so that valuable images could survive the next 40 years , that &apos;s about the period in which you really are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; since the future due to your nature is un@@ predic@@ table , you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re@@ assessed during the time . unfortunately , there are no other option than the current system down@@ wards . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easily it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
&quot; this question should actually be answered on the basis of the statements made in this document . use or change open standards , which are supported by many applications . &quot;
virtu@@ alization is now available today . if you have an old system to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is fairly simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and visual technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist printing for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means growing .
let &apos;s suppose that you have planned the scal@@ ability with one and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but hang it not . &quot;
&amp; K @-@ Dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ dc # source is / dev / s@@ dc # source is / dev / s@@ dc / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ O ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , fat@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if needed
open Source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software there you can read it . this task will be easier from year to year easier .
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format which slowly dis@@ appears from the market . so you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard developed by the GI@@ F . but it is more lu@@ st@@ ine , supported by X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can be used for improved colour information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F and a slow commune . this format we would like to recommend you to Save your pictures . &quot;
&quot; T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as image format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ com@@ pressed forms or in a container with a le@@ lu@@ st@@ free com@@ pression algorithms . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative File format is a licensed and open resource format which was developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G is now based on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is committed to the use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a handful of camera is now available and we hope to share the competitors Canon and Nikon it at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace 2001 , Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is included with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer a original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive . X@@ MP doesn &apos;t fit the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . however , you should think about problems in connection between the met@@ ad@@ ata file and the image file and as above all , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as containers and put it all together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organisation that supports fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , which includes working on an architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ ten@@ tious efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the dealer or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera of the camera , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your resource archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a fin@@ ite editing process you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tization , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these have been cut from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them first in Web@@ gal@@ eries , cook in MPEG , use in contact leaf@@ lets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; digi@@ tization . in section add a picture to an album you &apos;ll find a description of how you can already add photos to your hard disk . however the camera interface will provide you with many advanced settings to import images to your album database .
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization , connect it to the machine , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it off . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , this is trying to connect with your camera . some cameras do not appear . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame appears and a symbol of the file order for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the links properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . please note that with some digital cameras do not provide all information .
&quot; the rider met@@ ad@@ ata is showing the internal met@@ ad@@ ata like the P@@ Is , manufacturer Not@@ ting , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar out of the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization . please note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos to your computer is the click on the button . this loads all photos from their camera to one album and then we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired option with the default option of &amp; k@@ de . once you select the photos , use the button Download and then download it . the button selected will be chosen until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is this supported , an option New download is available . these pictures have not been checked by &amp; digi@@ tization . in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the pres@@ ets . if you choose this option , you will only have the new pictures downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you download the buttons all download or use it , a dialog will be displayed in which the photos are placed . the list of existing albums will be displayed as normal folder , displayed in the section My records . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after that you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; Pres@@ sure ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photographs , you can delete them from the camera . you can clear all of them by using the button Clear All . if you just want to delete a few , then you must first select and delete it afterwards . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to restore you from the camera . you should not verify it completely . you should therefore check carefully before you delete them from the camera . in case you don &apos;t want to delete the camera , since this is considerably faster . &quot;
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for photos often not particularly expres@@ sive names . this can usually be recovered after the photos from the camera . this can be recommended to double fil@@ ries in the same album . therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been taken into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the image and for file @-@ based under@@ mine . if you use this last option is automatically created a folder each day .
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the information about the author in the section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . when you select this , the corresponding entries are copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all loaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer a different date format than the standard format , you can use e.g. in the processing field the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % D % H : % M : % S . switch to the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in small case letters . or in large letters , if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , den &amp; digi@@ came ; used for a photo , is shown below the name that the camera is displayed in the preview . your settings for ren@@ ame will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tization ; can use any information about the orientation of the camera to time recording . not all cameras do this information . in section page bar Metad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
&quot; the automatic turning is usually switched on , and if your camera did not deliver this information , leaves the picture in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic turning point , use the button Exp@@ and@@ ed and choose the Autom@@ atic spin in the lower area of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provided information about the date , where the photo was made available , can create &amp; digi@@ tization ; this will be automatically loaded onto the image data . all images with the same date are available in the same sub@@ album . in the section page bar Met@@ a data you can read , which information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually off @-@ off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ tization ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this option . use this option Advanced and select the option dates at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the button . select the file optional dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than a file with the default &amp; k@@ de methods .
&quot; after the selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ tization ; you where the images are loaded high . a folder sharing dialog for the camera will be displayed . select the desired folder and press OK to load the up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be shown in long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal and l@@ ati@@ tudes and which can be indicated on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place . not everyone uses a plane to use an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can click on a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization : users who want to locate the location of photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is well the position data of a photo to play . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data get into the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ ons are supported in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module ( manual ) and finally about the manual entry of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . however , there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as maps or by transmission of data using a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , but this data is stored in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical attri@@ bution . &quot;
there are various programmes for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract the data of images and the GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal and l@@ ati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script that works using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the hall@@ marks of the ordin@@ ated coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ googl@@ e.com does not show European roads . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , all navigation details for Europe show . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tization ; trying to give you much control over his work@@ flows like possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization . you need to check these settings . you can switch to these settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; select action can be set on built @-@ in preview or phone editing . you place the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and the copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , when the option is to download from the camera interface . also with a database synchron@@ ization , this data is written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author is a syn@@ onym for fi@@ bers : this field should be the professional record of the photographer , as such as an employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a further description of the author , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to specify the photo , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or agency should be listed here , then the group or agency should be en@@ umer@@ ated here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . it is achieved that the met@@ ad@@ ata are permanently contained in the picture and are not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization ; imported without lost .
&quot; image fittings can be saved as embedded lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JP@@ EG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with images built into images . therefore , your compl@@ ments may also be read by other images , these are already written by that of &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; the page settings includes all the options for the information that appear , when the mouse c@@ ursor in the main window is printed about a file . depending on the chosen option this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&amp; # 160 ; Pres@@ sure ; supports a number of different formats and some video formats and audio formats . to set out which file types &amp; digi@@ tization . to set out what file types &amp; digi@@ tization . you can preview the file expansion of this list and remove any of these enh@@ ancements .
default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Updated right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ tization , can be set on this page on the default values . however , some images have turned different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the entire image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can get better stimul@@ us results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this one here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use the tool@@ bar in full mode . &quot;
&quot; head@@ - and under@@ ated areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker and bright colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in the picture editing , this picture @-@ mode can be inserted mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and can be switched off . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are coded into a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the text files , please read this article in Wikipedia to the closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the setting P@@ NG com@@ pression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation is not reduced the image quality since P@@ NG is using a lu@@ st@@ free algorith@@ m . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can put this value on a high com@@ pression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high com@@ pression . &quot;
with the option T@@ IF@@ F files com@@ press you to turn the default -@@ pres@@ sion@@ sal@@ g@@ algorithms for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it does not affect the image quality because the default -@@ algorith@@ m is lu@@ st@@ alled .
&quot; with the setting of loss @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files , you can save them lu@@ st@@ ine . even if you have written the dis@@ ed setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with the normal JP@@ EG . as this paragraph , met@@ ad@@ ata was not supported , but was still in planning . &quot;
&quot; in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tization , image processing was only a tool for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default settings is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ saving green pixel of the C@@ CD @-@ sensor can react more sensitive to ultr@@ avi@@ olet light , this difference features a little soft to detail . this option draws a little soft to eliminate this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option draws a little soft to elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws a little soft to elimin@@ ates this problem with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD @-@ quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only when the white is not set . default , it is a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white card that has been photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ scored pictures in four steps more details in the back@@ light . for other cameras , this option is ignored . &quot;
&quot; the standard is it the spot@@ light , so the parts of your images are built @-@ in , because of the in@@ ability of your camera shows the best text , as it shows the spot@@ light in different ros@@ at@@ rains . most recently , you can attempt some parts of the missing information from the top @-@ to @-@ design . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ tization therefore try to re@@ construct the missing red and red bul@@ ls out of the yet uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixel . of course this is a question how much colour or wh@@ ites you want .
&quot; when you select the option re@@ constructed , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be customized for every picture separately . &quot;
put the L@@ umin@@ ous to your taste . you probably have to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be made later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tization . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tization . in order to keep the time for the demo@@ lition .
a demo@@ a@@ icing -@@ algorith@@ m is a digital image process that comes from the colour@@ ful image sensor that displays many cameras and is known as CF@@ A @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; Pres@@ sure came ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives available : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m of the D@@ cra@@ w . it produces however colour@@ art@@ ef@@ acts in the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can bet the red and blue @-@ correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you are carried out during the raw converted . &quot;
a profile translated the colour information and gives instructions like this again should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; Pres@@ sure ; information such as Far@@ bin@@ ge is to be translated into the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior If a picture is opened in the image processing / colour administration module with blank files .
&quot; color folder , set up the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tization ; investig@@ ates this folder during the start . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to store . everything can change when opening the blank file later .
the colour view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images color@@ fully manages not the entire screen .
&quot; input profiles should be used to the camera unit and model that you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have a color @-@ tone or gam@@ mak@@ et . currently corrected it cra@@ w gam@@ ma not for con@@ versions at 16 bits depth . this means you have to perform the color @-@ tone mapping . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the soft @-@ proof profile , with which you em@@ ulate how to print your image from one device . this is very useful before you print image , as your printer commands a smaller colour area than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . this could you manually correct instead of leaving on the blind algorith@@ m of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious that color profile is provided for and for what is provided . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles . this answer is of course in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon pro@@ filing leaves the style for the purpose : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutr@@ ality , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de , imag@@ ery and work@@ ings . many modules support which were written to cooperate with each program , which is the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select that you want to use and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window , and in addition you will find some even in the context menu of the previous window . &quot;
&quot; short@@ listed for tasks , which are carried out by modules can set in the menu under settings in short @-@ command . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules can be downloaded via the K@@ IP@@ I project under http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the sli@@ deshow should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator , the time between the imaging , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other cross@@ roads turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata or out , which ends at the bottom end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show a list of all the cameras supported on the left side . on the right side there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to connect a camera that is connected to the computer . here are the port settings . currently , here are seri@@ als , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage devices . you have to select the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ pro@@ ms , indicate where you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization , you need to connect the camera with your computer to switch it in the display mode . &quot;
&quot; make you know if &amp; digi@@ tization ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set up camera dell and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will be displayed in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any type of name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confirmation dialog to rel@@ oc@@ ating &gt; Pictures to the M@@ ül@@ mer , you can configure the conversation of &amp; digi@@ tization ; while delet@@ ing a photo in one album . in the sections delet@@ ing a photo and delete an album you will find more details . &quot;
editorial changes made by the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ tization ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise , you will need to apply changes to the button . &quot;
they can also tie the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ tization ; at the start attachment . this speeds under circumstances the start operation of &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; the setting of Bei@@ m starts look for new pictures &amp; digi@@ tization ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the starting time of &amp; digi@@ tization . if something from the base folder has been deleted , asking for digi@@ tization : you whether it should delete them from the database . &quot;
various shades can be used in &amp; digi@@ tization ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can select from settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in creating a new design for digi@@ tization , you will find more information about this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tization ; contains a quick image processing with some base tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correction and improvement . the image processing may be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu and selection of the entry ads .
the editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization . so you are under certain circumstances not part of your distribution . you will find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in section image processing .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , which indicates the fil@@ en@@ ame , current date number , a enlargement factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for fast access to the most frequently used functions .
the processing functions of the image processing your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file Save or the button Save the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you should possibly take a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the editing file or using the button of the button editing in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change which you have done on the photo since the last time . &quot;
almost every action of the picture processing can be und@@ o res@@ sed and restored . the last action can be und@@ o by selecting the processing or restored by clicking editing lines from the menu .
&quot; if you often use this , you should make the short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to the back@@ tracking and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift ) to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; about the back@@ tracking and re @-@ button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer pressing , you will receive a context menu . if you choose one of the menu items , all actions are also und@@ one or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the phone number , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image r@@ under or the entries in the menu . if you want to make changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can get in the photo and get out of zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the in@@ sured menu .
&quot; to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magnific@@ ation factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full mode displays the photo in full mode . you will see in the normal view , where you can use the tool@@ bar . normally , you can visit this in the setup dialog by &amp; digi@@ tization . you can also view this in the setup dialog by &amp; digi@@ tization . you can view this in the setup dialog . see this section to set up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the actual picture , you can print the picture in the menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; pressure dialog . you can adjust here the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole phrases . you only need to select pictures from your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available , without the navigation boxes , even in the picture processing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multi@@ f@@ aches on the same rider leaves the page bar out and disappear again in the edge .
&quot; in the lab@@ eling view , you can input holes with unlimited size or insert . please note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are permitted in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data support only ASC@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC compl@@ ementary field in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after which you have commented , you can use either the button , or simply change the next picture , the signs are then saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the applying button , there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , this will always be done when you choose a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written into the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the review evaluation shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in addi@@ cts and sor@@ rows . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the page bar , or with the keyboard bar . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select this and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the keywords showing a search box for fil@@ tering the key@@ word , the key@@ word and a selective box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
the keywords will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the specified key@@ word . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief in the input of keywords in a picture series . if you have different keywords , these are stored for fast access . &quot;
&quot; key@@ word ( s ) may also be set by mark@@ ers of the corresponding An@@ tes fields in the tree , and all the tags of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the top view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word version . &quot;
&quot; the sc@@ anned sc@@ rap filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and search views are used , only the intersection of these two are displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw the tags and drop them off . suppose you have selected several images in the main view , in order to pull out using key@@ word , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . then a dialog will ask you whether you want to use the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the top example , the main window shows the images on a calendar tag . the key@@ word filter is reduced to No keywords , which indicates the quantity of three pictures . they were pulled up with Str@@ g + a , and then a key@@ word should be drag@@ ged into the choice and stored there . a dialog will ask if this key@@ word should be put . &quot;
this search for changes will take place when you start the program . it can also be switched among settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and discover that it would have one or its needs , you can easily change this with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in terms of control . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which you are looking for in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; 3 . : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
you can e.g. choose an extended search across all elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the cross field at the end of the rule and then use the button &apos; group@@ ing . the options are as follows : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r ? free space is there to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I used it mainly to practice ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a far@@ b@@ aker work@@ flow , that is the colors that have actually photographed and sent colors come from . with a colour@@ ful work@@ flow , you can reach that colours on your monitor or scanner and the colours you print or on the web publish them out of your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; when the theme comes to color management , everybody wants to know which buttons it needs to press . unfortunately , the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with information information about color management . in addition , you will find links with more detailed information and enable you to receive the desired results . &quot;
&quot; if your work@@ work@@ flow meets all six below criteria , then you do not need to take care of color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that has been calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum . ( further information can be found below )
&quot; your only other images are sent via e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is . &quot;
so when s@@ R@@ GB works so well and make life for all so simple why should you use another color tree and make thoughts about color @-@ management ?
&quot; a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we can truly see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours we can see the hor@@ ses@@ hoe region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farmers so visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click info and then on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to check@@ out my monitor when I decided to work only in the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum or not , you need to work your monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ , because s@@ R@@ GB doesn &apos;t matter the circle . if you want to work as in the Far@@ br@@ aum by s@@ R@@ GB , you need to either use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB standard , an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , the same , automatic shut@@ down and contrast of the menu cor@@ rigi@@ ate Autom@@ atic correction are automatically attemp@@ ting out of your colors the best . you will be experimenting with these effects , to see which is best viewed in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method sk@@ ali@@ ert the full image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point will change as bright as possible without its colour sh@@ ado@@ wing . this feature is often a Mag@@ ical correction for pictures that are dark or full . &quot;
&quot; un@@ equal : this method j@@ us@@ ted the lumin@@ osity of the colours of the selected image , so that the hist@@ og@@ ram of the intensity function is as flat as possible . sometimes , it produces the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces just cra@@ p . it is a very powerful operation which either causes wonders to an image or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automatic abra@@ sion : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . they select the dark and bright border @-@ tones and j@@ us@@ ks the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ o@@ grams . &quot;
&quot; contrast , this method increases the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest level of values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for poor photos . &quot;
the white @-@ comparison of &amp; digi@@ tization came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ straight correction is slightly limited because over a Far@@ br@@ aum is working with 8 @-@ bit per colour . in case you can perform too far from the original image , in case you can perform the white @-@ bit mode in the raw mode , so your chances of correction is better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white syn@@ onom@@ ical algorithms , protected by P@@ aw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it through the menu @-@ order colors white @-@ comparison of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the pres@@ ch@@ u@@ ster can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and preview of the target picture . the preview is adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white video , then it is enough to click the window . &quot;
the preview of the Target has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ ram .
&quot; on the right above , a hist@@ og@@ ram appears that dynam@@ ically changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ og@@ ram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ escence . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ia . &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on the shadow , satur@@ ation and Gamma . the shade will allow you to improve the shadow details of your photos or also download it . &quot;
&quot; an@@ stat with the controls mentioned above , you should use the color temperature slide . press this button and then somewhere on the scene to use the color temperature of the white balance . this type are also automatically set the temperature and green values . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white comparison with the list of preference . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ layer indic@@ t@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color canal is over@@ exposed . this will display the combined result in the whit@@ eboard . this is displayed in the P@@ review as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; buttons save as and store are exactly this . every setting of the white balance you have set , you can save it into a text file and then load it later . &quot;
the button pres@@ ets is using all fil@@ tering values again to their default values and associated neutral white @-@ balances . note that also neutral settings may be a different photo than your original results . if you save this will be your original image .
&quot; you can set the co@@ di@@ sti@@ r per color channel for the editing image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely spread JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ dation is better for high @-@ quality pictures . this coding also stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialogue as to the processing of raw materials . it uses the modification and assignment of colour profiles . color @-@ tone mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the handling . a det@@ a@@ illed manual for the use of colour profiles , you can rate the chapter of color management . &quot;
&quot; a further important tool can be found in the menu under colors key values . this tool displays an integrated way to finish several color channels at the same time . this is useful when your camera or your scanner always wants to make the same error , and you will always find the same correction . &quot;
&quot; to correct a very powerful possibility of correc@@ ting problems is the tool for gr@@ ading , that you can find under colors gr@@ ad@@ ation in the menu . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tools paint effects will provide you with four color effects , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and a cant@@ een filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was solar isation , even Sab@@ ati@@ er called , an effect of the picture . the colored , dar@@ ker areas sheltered from the added light . this tool was a partial negative part of the picture . this tool permits you to fine these interesting effect fine . &quot;
the intensity controls the solar isation . at about 50 % intensity the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible is . another raise finally creates a negative image that so does not produce on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
&quot; this is an example of the solar movement . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and the ( 2 ) , which applied intensity is 30 % . &quot;
the Vi@@ vid filters recre@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contr@@ ast@@ eful effect that makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it easy to make sure many photos .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day light @-@ optimized re@@ plac@@ e. the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors with day@@ light and high contr@@ asts , but also a number of photographers , especially those who hardly distingu@@ ishes landscapes , too much . &quot;
&quot; the Ne@@ on@@ filter si@@ p@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contr@@ asts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ é . at large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light @-@ conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the paint contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can to experiment with the various colour aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu and you can use the button below . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you make a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one to great satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool is reduced to increase the satur@@ ation instead of increasing them . all changes you can perform in the preview . if Him would like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool Gr@@ ad@@ ation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contr@@ asts / Gamma is the tool of sound @-@ correction to improve the exposure . even if dialogue on this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of sli@@ der . more concrete the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ o@@ grams . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph@@ ite of the intensity setting , a hist@@ og@@ ram , the active channel as well as the selected area . beneath the graph@@ ite are three slides in which are cli@@ cked and postp@@ oned to change the intensity &apos;s values . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and pay attention to it as the picture changes .
&quot; on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be considered . the preview is dynamic , updated with the settings of the picture . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ og@@ ram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mix Y axis is represented . for pictures of a digital camera is often the linear hist@@ og@@ ram by a single pillar domin@@ ates . in this case the linear hist@@ og@@ ram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is useful .
&quot; three Reg@@ ul@@ ators : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle notes , commonly called Gam@@ ma@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the three colours can be used in the review of the original image , in order to automatically update the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic b@@ illing . &quot;
output values : the output values allow for selecting manual values for each range . there are also two regul@@ ators to change the output values for example to create a back@@ light image as background to create something else in the foreground .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the picture . &quot;
&quot; save as and store , with these buttons , the indicated values can be saved in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded again . there@@ for the Gimp is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and use the three colour versions , the input values will be re@@ group@@ ed automatically for all shadows , means and Sundays , and click on the preview of the original image to set the input value of the hist@@ o@@ grams for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ous channels . &quot;
the option In@@ bel@@ ating indi@@ k@@ ator controls all shades to display over@@ loaded pixels and you can preview the combined result of all channels . this is how you can preview the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
&quot; below you can see an example of the placement of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is being updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modification Channel : this selection box allows to channel the channel that is changed from the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case the linear mode will assist in the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode . &quot;
&quot; if you move to the right , for example , the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright tones with dar@@ ker output cor@@ ks , and that the associated picture pixel is dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original pictures is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the area you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move this then and down , until the value to your flavor is . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , you can accurately do this . each bend that you created can be stored in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp &apos;s format . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this method and the three color shades , automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun @-@ t@@ ints . activate the color p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blu@@ epr@@ int , blue and L@@ umin@@ ous curve . &quot;
&quot; the option In@@ bel@@ ating indi@@ k@@ ator controls all shades to display over@@ loaded pixels . if in more than one channel shift pixels , you get the combined result displayed . it is an indicator that is , i.e. you can see the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white picture that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ Canal . shadow and sun @-@ sounds are set with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and is applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and this corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel Mix@@ er of the &amp; digi@@ tization is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the shades of photos .
the channel @-@ mix@@ er is another highly developed tool for mixing the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu channel channel mix@@ er of the photo editing .
&quot; with the channel exten@@ sible box you can select the color for the hist@@ og@@ ram , this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be seen as compared to your own rider . &quot;
the preview of the goal has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ ram to show you the appropriate color frame .
&quot; controls for the module are right down : controller for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . in case you can also enable the appropriate color components , as the channel @-@ mix@@ er will retain the DAS tool to create magnificent black and white conver@@ ters of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible ru@@ stling tone that does not appear in the same spot in the color channel , and their smoke patterns will occur in each channel . if this is the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion thus improve in which you can reduce the color@@ full first . &quot;
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any any bl@@ ender setting can save you later and then load . the file format is the Gimp channel Mix@@ er format .
the option In@@ bel@@ ating indi@@ k@@ ator controls all shades to display over@@ loaded pixels and you can preview the combined result of all channels . this is how you can preview the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been re@@ produced . the option L@@ umin@@ ia is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photo was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action capability . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step as color pictures can be converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ out profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
&quot; Grün@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lin@@ eup filter . this looks good , with all the scenery and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin , as well as the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin filter . &quot;
Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a or@@ anges Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this enh@@ ances landscapes , maritime scenes and a@@ erial photos . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) orange @-@ filmed . &quot;
rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film @-@ exposure with a red light filter . this creates dr@@ astic @-@ effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ ess to day @-@ time . so much like the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
Gel@@ b@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film @-@ exposure with a yellow lin@@ eup filter . this is the most natural color @-@ tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Co@@ kin .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium tones by adding a bit col@@ dness in the shadows of a pressure and the re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 Co@@ kin .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool texture apply to apply decorative textures to one image .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait on a wall . the menu item image texture and image processing can be used for it . &quot;
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the length of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool to add a decorative frame can be added to a picture .
keeping an eye on the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to add a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scattered eye . under picture frames the module can be started out of image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . ski@@ pping the picture with a nice line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) that ch@@ opped off with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button @-@ saving and decorative fits a decorative frame with patterns added .
width : covers the width of the frame in percent . the value area for the width is reduced from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this with the frame decor@@ ating target will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool following aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ ated text into an image at any point . this also goes to multiple places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with your mouse . if you need text box , orientation , color from the color size and the character set with its characteristics as you need . you will simply choose a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ lit background . already the picture is ready . &quot;
any setting which you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool sten@@ cil helps you place a template on a picture .
the menu picture template uses in the image processing can be used to create templates over one image .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on size and orientation . however , if you want to add the P@@ NG file format and you should add with maximum com@@ pression ( 9 ) to increase the file size of the template , so simply send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ tization ; mail@@ ing@@ list Pres@@ sure check @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil with the button @-@ button folder in the dialog box . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noticed for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the wor@@ zel@@ ord@@ ner is set for the sten@@ cils for the sten@@ cils , that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . the selection of a folder is updated automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , three buttons are with which you can change the enlargement factor and position of your image . &quot;
&quot; enlarge : this button enlarged the picture above . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; reduction : this button bur@@ ns the underlying image . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you need to enlarge the picture according to the mouse button . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move this button to move the picture under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired location .
use OK if you want to apply the template on your image . the image will then be adapted to an automatic scanning size .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; provides three different tools to di@@ ver . each one of you has mer@@ its in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ness is a traditional tool for the sharp@@ ness . it is very fast and simple , but generates especially in dark areas , gr@@ ading images . &quot;
&quot; un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture shar@@ per . indeed , it works more psych@@ ov@@ is@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to be atmospheric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s here a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken out of Gimp and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang . &quot;
&quot; re@@ kin@@ d@@ osing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters for adjustment . &quot;
photos without focus and most digi@@ tised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this in turn leads to a common color combined with only minimum differences . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally need more detri@@ mental less than regular cameras for the private user .
&quot; with JP@@ EG images , a camera internal sharp@@ ness has been applied . images in the raw format , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner can turn a shar@@ pen@@ ed page during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this , you will get control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness tool . you can call you with the menu of the menu . &quot;
&quot; you should be dealing carefully as the results do not seem very natural : the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but increases the har@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fy it via the menu entry . you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : one picture is too tight . the solution to draw a bit soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen@@ ing . use the tool to draw a soft sign with the menu supplement , and experiment something with settings . the pad@@ lock on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview can help edit the image . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should first be tried out . if you make the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask , become smo@@ ker and the impression of gr@@ ats close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radio . you should therefore shar@@ pen@@ ed pictures of the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped picture to be added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the swelling is worth a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and to apply the difference . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ t from shar@@ pen@@ ing and hence still@@ ness in many faces , cel@@ esti@@ al and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a pig = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ sing re@@ focused on a picture through improving the sharp@@ ness . it used to be used by copyright @-@ protected fil@@ tering filters -@@ algorith@@ m of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to create a picture of &amp; quot ; re@@ focused approach ; this is better approach than trying to sharp@@ ens the photo . this is a better approach than just trying to sharp@@ ens the photo . you can usually start the use of an in@@ shar@@ k mask . you can start using it from the menu by clicking on colors re@@ vocation in the image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular F@@ altung operates much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , depending on the original pixel . the F@@ IR Vienna in@@ verse of the pal@@ ate &apos;s F@@ altung is also influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixel . it causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular F@@ altung . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images the default value should put 1 good results . you can put a higher value if your image should be very bl@@ ur@@ red then click on Heiligen@@ p@@ ons .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.95 and respective . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ly effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ ck@@ filter : an increase in the smo@@ ker filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful . however , values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful . however , values higher than 0.1 is very poor . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will continue to consume the image . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sch is . in most cases , you should use this value in 0 to run annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you might also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ h@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ ri@@ descent size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ational speed . however , an increase in matri@@ xes can choose good results , especially if you select large values for the circular foam or pal@@ ate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any refund parameters that you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try all the cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but leave later in@@ pleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you are reading pictures and com@@ press com@@ press , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ com@@ pressed picture . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king can produce better results as sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by being bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighbourhood used as sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , inv@@ alu@@ able mas@@ king must always generate art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never indicate the effect of the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed filter . practically , the result of the F@@ IR @-@ filter is always at least as good as the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better in handling small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can make a comparison between the different fil@@ tering , on a small un@@ focused picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp colour picture has to be corrected . this picture has been made using an analog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto @-@ focus lin@@ se .
&quot; for more information on the methods available for example , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
&quot; the regul@@ ator smooth@@ ed the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed of the area of the sub@@ mer@@ ged area , in order to generate a natural P@@ up@@ lift . &quot;
&quot; the dy@@ tin@@ te allows a customized colour for pl@@ up@@ lift . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot;
the tool error correction is one of the most highly developed tool to fail to remove the desired ef@@ acts with un@@ parall@@ eled speed .
the video algorith@@ m was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; this tool contains various preferences as starter , in order to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are down below : &quot;
&quot; in case you want to edit the filter settings fat , you can use the rider smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail@@ eh@@ ousing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a even@@ ly smooth@@ ed on the picture . a value of 0.7 should keep details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be subjected to detail . please note that the details will always be subordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; jud@@ ging dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es even@@ ly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . in case you have a film @-@ related pattern . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best handled with a value nearby 1 . &quot;
smooth@@ ed &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ evi@@ p then define the relative gl@@ uc@@ tance . therefore use this value to the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more the more smoking is occurring as it then becomes difficult to create the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ petition : returns how often the algorith@@ m is running . usually it is enough here 1 or 2 .
&quot; Win@@ kel@@ on@@ screen since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : wind @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is small , you should also be small for a long run . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral st@@ ep@@ width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral st@@ ep@@ width in pixels . you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never exceed 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More about quality that you obtain from choice of this option is only small . he doubles the running time . we recommend it to allow him to leave .
&quot; buttons save as and store are exactly this . every setting of error error can be stored into a text file , and later be loaded again . &quot;
&quot; however , educational error is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and take a high CPU load after it . you can therefore ab@@ ort the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b ab@@ ort . &quot;
below you can see how images can be corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black arti@@ fact that was caused by a poor watching during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; rou@@ bles@@ ome is a very powerful tool to reduce pictures . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorith@@ m by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool displays out sel@@ ectable image filter available to remove spots and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or mo@@ wing spheres ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor det@@ ectors of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been done with a digital camera and a high standard sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined smoking that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will need only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain in default settings . &quot;
radius controls the window size from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is moving over the image and color in it is checked and thus smaller fl@@ ags .
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of the filter . this value puts the pixel filter to determine if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and lubric@@ ate or lubric@@ ate again . &quot;
edges : controls the accuracy of the filter . this value improves the frequency response from the filter . if he is too strong can not remove the whole noise or pre@@ disposition . put it on a value nearby the maximum when you want to remove an alert of smoking or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing any details .
&quot; lumin@@ ance : controls the intoler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend that either color or lumin@@ ance to change , to improve the image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of which is controlled by the details settings . &quot;
color : controls the color @-@ toler@@ ant of the picture . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change in order to improve the image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the details settings .
&quot; Gamma : controls the gam@@ mas @-@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas , which is typically more bol@@ ted to increase . he also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the phosph@@ or absorption . this value defines as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if he is lifted up , the edges appear to occur . if he can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges , it can remove smokers and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save and store : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for the reduction , which you have set can be saved into the fil@@ es@@ ystem , and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how smokers can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and this corrected with ( 2 ) . the reduction of smoking has been applied with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ ly for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen@@ ed . this allows you to use a soft sign with the menu item cor@@ rigi@@ d , and experiment with the smooth@@ est on the right side of the dialog it shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce phot@@ og@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter to restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to emerge Gau@@ ß &apos;s , film gran@@ ting , com@@ pression , com@@ pression , and detri@@ mental images that flow in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . the smooth@@ ing takes place along the image and therefore gets the content as it also makes the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and textures , the text error is done . the algorith@@ m for restoration was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the com@@ pression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of com@@ pression surgery ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ com@@ pressed picture . this setting should correct these issues . &quot;
&quot; buttons save as and store are exactly this . every setting of photo restoration may be saved into a text file , and later be loaded again . &quot;
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however it can take very long and take a high CPU load after it . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can see how a photo with like @-@ shaped diamond cut off .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity to the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and this corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that was used with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts led by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ ations and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool Hot@@ pixel permits it Hot@@ pixel of photos that have been controlled with a C@@ CD camera , eight were used to remove algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , tot@@ e or hot pixels are particularly high at high @-@ quality raw materials photos an issue as many cameras with JP@@ EG com@@ pression over a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels have . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; &apos;s pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pixel &quot; ; there is currently no manual approach to select the bad pixel . &quot;
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the button of the Light . the tool will automatically identify the hot and bright pixels .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark picture directly in connection to detect new name or bright pixels by C@@ CD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the proper dark picture to the correc@@ tive image . please note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and this automatically invites you to the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview will help you correct the result in the picture . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are taken out in all previous areas .
&quot; choose an area around the broken pixel to preview and see the results of the filter . select after this , select the best filter method to cross these pixel blocks . these are the available filters : &quot;
thir@@ sty - it will be an average of the neighbouring pixel . the color of the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixel . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels which have a distance from 1 from the Pix@@ el@@ block to be taken to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ tering method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ ically : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can view the Hot@@ pixel correction to a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original picture was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ fication - is a tool to correct the Vign@@ et@@ ting , i.e. under@@ ated corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; for@@ esi@@ ble lenses , especially those in the middle and large photo format , often the entire sensor area could not be illuminated . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ank ) them the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light to the sensor there . Tele@@ objective may also demonstrate that . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters need one factor 1,5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . for@@ c@@ angle lenses , even with center @-@ filter , an opening of f / 16 or less use , since otherwise in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large cutting areas of today &apos;s film and the colour or gray stu@@ ff@@ ing of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ filter by a fil@@ tering transformation in a raw image , which is applied without this filter . the tool focuses on a picture filter . the algorith@@ m is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vign@@ a Cor@@ rection and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of lumin@@ ous absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the default density is 2,@@ 0 , what a visual filter with an aper@@ ture angle of 2 , un@@ matched by increases the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ il@@ ation , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and gam@@ ma @-@ settings : the editing of an image with the Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ fication output reduces the lumin@@ osity of the target image . you need to re@@ use the exposure of the target image with these options . the Reg@@ ul@@ ators provide only positive values , as you only have to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er rev@@ amping of exposure of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contr@@ asts / gam@@ ma at zero and use the Gr@@ ad@@ ation from the &amp; digi@@ tization . pictures from the menu of color Gr@@ ad@@ ation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ fication @-@ correction is applied to an image . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the Vign@@ et@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ tive image . a fl@@ us@@ - and contr@@ ast@@ eful correction is also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Lin@@ d@@ ver@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colour@@ ful distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second hor@@ ades treats the general geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or counter @-@ witch shape of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third dit@@ ch has a similar circular effect , fl@@ eight but to the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ efficient fourth Gr@@ ades corrected the distant corners on the part of the second gr@@ ades . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; generally , this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second gr@@ ades . with negative values can be corrected , and positive values can be corrected or distor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the fourth Gr@@ ades . this value seems stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most of the lenses , the &apos; Corner parameters changed the sign of the parameter . &quot;
z@@ oom : this value scal@@ ates the size @-@ size and thus leads to a correction of the first wheel . negative values enlarge while positive the picture is smaller .
&quot; light : this value j@@ us@@ ks the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . values you use for your image , are stored and used at the next starting as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the tonn@@ age or cus@@ hion correction should be carried out before all audi@@ ences or size changes . at best , you perform this correction as all the first by . if you re@@ ap an image and then carry out an extra @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be obvious that the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool displays you a vertical and a horizontal option line . move the mouse button in the picture views to fix the lines at this point . afterwards you can fix the line / ho@@ oks of the lines with the help of the lines . &quot;
if you want to correct an anti @-@ shaped tra@@ verses the resulting picture black corners . you can transform these with the cutting @-@ tool set in the menu or remove the z@@ oom Reg@@ ul@@ ator of this dialogue .
&quot; for most pictures the tonn@@ age ranges from . the next logical step for some motives , such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings it is the perspective to correct the all angles in the picture 90 degrees . please note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight conc@@ er@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the correc@@ tive correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) , and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the algorith@@ m is based on a method of simul@@ ating infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ i@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; on the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can see the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters setup and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the gr@@ ading texture of a highly sensitive movie simul@@ ator . the ISO regul@@ ator changed the quantity of the film gra@@ zing and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows will know as snow !
&quot; since the filter colour channels to reproduce by infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color is missing . &quot;
this is an example of infr@@ ared camera . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the edited image under ( 2 ) see . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra into the top .
&quot; the &amp; Pres@@ sure ; filter film @-@ gr@@ itt is an easy to use tool to reproduce film @-@ gr@@ itt , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers large silver @-@ gra@@ ins of the photo em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ channel effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treat@@ able image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from daily life . in case you want this specific , gallery @-@ like , street photography , especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ men photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the Kör@@ ner will be calibr@@ ated . the default value is , although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you are even more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film item for a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the working ( 2 ) . the original film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter oil painting , creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ legal protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter oil gem@@ s gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and breast @-@ feeding are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two shelves to affect this effect . the upper chosen the brush size between one and five out of th@@ icker brush are better for large pictures . smooth@@ ing the smooth@@ ie or , from the other side looked , the hin@@ d@@ iness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the work is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin@@ out size for this 640 pixels high image is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter coal use uses color and intensity gra@@ dient for creating a carbon finish . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ise you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
&quot; there are two shelves with a valuation of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper shelves choose the rod from and the lower j@@ us@@ ks the contrast , the contrast . &quot;
this is an example of the co@@ atings filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adapting the intensity .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was repaired in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to return your images using a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , where color does not use the difference between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ stro@@ us landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows you to adjust the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave @-@ bu@@ cks 1 : shares the image in cells and makes it look like it is seen by gl@@ az@@ es .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to wav@@ el@@ blocks 1 is distor@@ ted the image here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the button .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an art work using un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed effects . it is used to proprietary algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
z@@ oom Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : wi@@ g@@ out the image along s@@ inner lines that can go from a centre . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ redness to a zo@@ om@@ end camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often used in sport photography .
radi@@ al un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : conf@@ uses the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ redness of a revol@@ ving camera .
removal scheme : wi@@ g@@ out the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back in the background .
&quot; movement pricel@@ ess : wi@@ g@@ out the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ redness of a linear movements , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
sof@@ tening un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : caught the image soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and gl@@ os@@ sy dre@@ ad@@ effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle inc@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; in@@ suff@@ ice in@@ ept , conf@@ using the image by random shift of the pixels and simul@@ ates the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera . &quot;
intelligent in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ ped this without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops in your image . this gives it natural your images a great look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by protected algorith@@ m .
dro@@ pping size allows the size of the drop to change . as the dri@@ zzle size does not automatically increase with the size of the picture it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the sperm effect of drops in the picture .
&quot; you can keep an area free of rain drops in order to select the area , e.g. a face that is free to stay free . if you start the filter rain drops off the range will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain drops . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the be@@ worked picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirror or rotating into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform or transform mir@@ rors . &quot;
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of picture quality .
a picture to enlarge is simple . the big question is how you can get an image blo@@ wing and the details get sharp ? how can you find the missing info again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorith@@ m which is used here is doing a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; the tool used to change the size makes an line@@ are inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool . &quot;
&quot; many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , for example Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation , using an image . &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m photo was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio : if this option is activated , the entry of the new size is the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more the more smoking is occurring as it then becomes difficult to create the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; buttons save as and store are used exactly in this way . any input for photo can be saved as a text file , and later be loaded again . &quot;
&quot; photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what it does , but it can still take very long and to drag a high CPU load . you can break the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo bub@@ bles by enlar@@ ging a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) is the result of linear standard Aug@@ mentation to compare .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequent operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to add a picture . the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photo will cut the way off . so you can change a good overview of your photo to the cutting area . you can drag the size of the area by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can drag the size of the rect@@ angle with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting cut , use the button of the cutting button of the tool@@ box in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save file to save the cro@@ pped photo . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ section you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain . &quot;
&quot; in the mold on an aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the width of width is always assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cut off aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use Cen@@ timeter , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see for example a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their side @-@ relationship rati@@ os . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons for the selection automatically horizontal or vertical .
&quot; below you can set the area with the Max . ratio kno@@ b the area to the access to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool subject to side ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or vertical ) , these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image measurements are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , and does not reflect the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the com@@ for@@ ting aid allow you to don@@ ate in support , so that you can put your pictures better . these support are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic ponds are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third party , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal tri@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; Golden Center : the Golden Center is a split that is divided into various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a nau@@ sea @-@ sea or the sp@@ ells of a sun@@ flower . it emerg@@ es in all sorts of things that we felt as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used in the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to expand your temples and p@@ yrami@@ ds . artist and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i eps . 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 ,
the Golden Center provides liquid relief lines at your disposal when you set a picture . these help are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring your goal good results for your photos to get near@@ er . compared to third @-@ reg@@ iment a liquid line of the eye can follow through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the beh@@ older along the line of the spiral and creates an symmet@@ ric flow on this way .
&quot; another rule is the rectangular area of the golden spiral , also called Golden square . it should give something that the eye is in the center of composition . that may be a line or different objects . this something can just be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles also lead from the top of the golden spiral . your verti@@ ces are the middle points of the golden tri@@ angles . please note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , the Golden tri@@ angles are no equivalent tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ als can place a static object dynam@@ ical appeared . &quot;
&quot; when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect of a professional photo ograph called dynamic sy@@ ry . try to place your educational background on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently . &quot;
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al reflect and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ious pond .
&quot; with the button color , you can put the color of the relief lines . in case you can have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture around any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo then it happens easily that you are not exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates an image in which things are turned around an angle . you can fix it with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing and tool free rotation , select the target corner . &quot;
&quot; spin your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button settings , you can switch to the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right above . &quot;
&quot; at your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation is a horizontal and a vertical line at your disposal . move the mouse c@@ ursor in the scene to fix the two lines . now you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now edit the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have filmed a picture , you will be able to find unwanted holes in the corners . a way to fix it is the function transform and use the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function Autom@@ atic sugar . select one of the following options :
the --@@ anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after turning it . but keep in mind the above warning .
all per@@ tin@@ ent transform@@ ations are carried out at one fix@@ ture to the so called reference point . this point is displayed in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective you must use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right of the dialog , you will find some information which can help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle on top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after the adaptation of the perspective , the picture will be a bit sc@@ ary . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
after which you have adapted the perspective you get un@@ pleas@@ ent tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to ber@@ some it &apos;s the picture with trans@@ forming adding from the image processing .
&quot; the tool @-@ tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no rotation , the image is trans@@ verse . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . you can transform this module via transform@@ ers . &quot;
sc@@ iss@@ ors your picture by using the Horiz@@ ont@@ al angles and the vertical angle . you can press horizontal and vertical at the same time . if you press up preference . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the view @-@ section .
&quot; for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool @-@ tool to adjust your picture . &quot;
&quot; after which you have carried out the coating , the image becomes a bit conf@@ lic@@ ted . for a single loop , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shifts are twice as bl@@ ur@@ ging and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after shr@@ inking , the picture has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate these is to cut the picture with trans@@ forming cutting from the image processing . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tization ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write formats . the following formats therefore depend on your system and in some cases of how these libraries have been comp@@ elled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats in this position . however , they will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F below . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tization ; only displays files in formats . this happens on the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file extension . you can edit this list of file extension . in the configuration configuration you can find more information .
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to select even the format used . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports both formats .
picture com@@ pression is the use of data com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ists on digital images . there are redund@@ ant information in order to save the image data to an efficient manner .
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , gl@@ atter@@ ing results as JP@@ EG in the same com@@ pression surgery . the 200@@ 0s version can also be saved , if this is indicated in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to find out more about the raw materials , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous landscape and Cambridge in Colour very useful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw converted video . you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tization ; supports the shop of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is included in &amp; digi@@ tization . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ tization :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . however , this formats and will look forward for watching movies . &amp; digi@@ tization ; but if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can use the movies to play movies to play the program for playing back . &quot;
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you go back before .
synchron@@ izes the met@@ ad@@ ata between the database and all the files of the current main window . the images created the met@@ ad@@ ata of the database and not in other way as with this menu .
&quot; menu item of the K@@ IP@@ I Modu@@ ls , for the manual , automatic rot@@ ational / mirror for the current image on the basis of the EX@@ IF information . &quot;
&quot; sorted all pictures in the current album according to their name , path , date , file size or their rating . &quot;
&quot; starts the comparison of all met@@ ad@@ ata between the database and all files , so not just those in the current view as with this menu . the met@@ ad@@ ata database is over@@ written by the data of files in variations . the other variant can be started from the menu album . &quot;
all @-@ configured cameras are en@@ umer@@ ated here . you can add the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please see the camera to set up further information .
K@@ IP@@ I module can be exported to a series of images in a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth .
&quot; if you can test the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do good when the initi@@ ale contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four comp@@ ut@@ ations with the Module White . &quot;
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ tization : included . your description follows here .
&quot; all imaging tools such as sharp@@ ness , soft@@ ness , so@@ ok@@ us , un@@ sharp , bl@@ ur mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialogue type that shows the effect on the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture &quot; &quot; in this dialogue : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress report shows the status of the filter on the current image . links from him permit 5 buttons to change the comparison mode of the proposition @-@ area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter is applied to the range of the selected pre @-@ foam area .
horizont@@ ally divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter is applied to the range below the selected tip range .
ver@@ tically divide . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal divide . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &quot; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the pre @-@ foam area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can turn off to show over and under@@ exposure . the colors can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and click on the part of the picture you want to see . preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated instantly .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings are removed from the last use of the module .
the page bar features shows the essential information about the chosen image and is largely explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed into the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
&quot; this rider is available for intuitive maps based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature program . you can push the mouse button with the mouse wheel or push it and move . move it while you are fil@@ tered with the mouse button . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires the image of your images of Ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for mach@@ ining of color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files , which are of &amp; k@@ de ; are installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and interfaces used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog range , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the file folder . &quot;
the c@@ ursor is displayed in the pall@@ et view as a line . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside it . the color is described under the pall@@ et view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the c@@ ursor there . then move the mouse with penet@@ rated left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ field Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted in the c@@ ursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ writing . this mode can be set by selecting the crossing below by Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as in the last section , can be used together with the promotions , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the parts of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a po@@ len@@ der character , meaning that a color can be inserted in the cli@@ p@@ board , this can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit . &quot;
the colors in the range and the output of colour choices can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left side .
&quot; graph@@ ite viewer ; is a KDE program for watching &amp; Graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs are free layout programs . graphs are available in science , especially in computer science , and so far , there have been no modern &amp; GUI ; programs to visu@@ alize graphs and programs , according to the program author &apos;s author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with just a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly interface with all the features of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de programme .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; Graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; programme in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in graphs in &amp; Kate ; graphs re@@ counts and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; Kate ; to open or the graphs in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component
loading of big graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to present more than these knots )
&quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . required in detail : &quot;
the main window shows the open graphs each in one &apos;s own window . in the beginning when you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; without an argument the tool@@ bar only contains the icon to open and the ( empty ) List has been opened . click on the first symbol to open the dialog file .
&quot; after you have chosen one or more of the dot , the main window looks like in the lower the screenshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the character . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; the mouse @-@ wheel use ( high and lower without special buttons , left and right at penet@@ rated &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the just changed in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; loaded the file from a different program is shown the following window will be displayed :
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h is to be loaded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; you can also remember your decision later , you can also use the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a Graph@@ ite outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; site instance , &amp; eg ; in the file Browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; or to open the graphs in a sub@@ window of the already current instance . &quot;
as with the last option you can permanently save your choice but also change it with the tool dialog .
&quot; in the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save and later . &quot;
&quot; you can also define how the graph can be divided into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical pages may be chosen freely . &quot;
&quot; when you use several pages , you can choose whether the portions of the graph@@ ite will be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the different parts of the graph . &quot;
side@@ bar with one on several sides divided graphs without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the page again shop gives the opportunity to set out the behavior if a file was changed on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set up a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time . &quot;
the opening gives the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; if a graph is open beyond a running session . you can set up a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window ) or determine that every time is asked .
the site property management provides the possibility to set up the starting @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you can set up a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine to be asked for each start then .
&quot; the context menu , which usually occurs by a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens further options : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; Graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; Graphi@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; and dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the standard for targeted graphs . he produces hierarch@@ ical or mach@@ ined images of court graphs . the algorith@@ m lays down the edges into the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short can@@ als and as few cant@@ ors as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorith@@ m is the standard for odd graphs . it produces depic@@ tions according to the spr@@ ing@@ ray model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ K@@ aw@@ ai algorith@@ m is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorith@@ m creates for odd graphs a spr@@ ing@@ ray model - layout . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold army and includes a multi @-@ mo@@ il for the treatment of large and g@@ ec@@ lu@@ st@@ alled graphs .
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; -@@ algorith@@ m is the node circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams by several cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then run by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as parameters , and the calculated layout of graphs after st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format you can change , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graphs ( directed or odd ) , and turns the default algorithms for the respective type ( dot ; for stri@@ ving , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for odd graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , the overview is displayed , provided that it is necessary . otherwise , it is not displayed and the positioning of the positioning is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the what is the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor . click with this mouse @-@ c@@ ursor to a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get more help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; Graphi@@ vi@@ z ; tools for display . it needs the following package :
&quot; a special institution is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; in the menu settings , you will find more options . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the symbol Edit@@ ors is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for character tools , the stat@@ us@@ bar , the .@@ colour palette and the Git@@ tern@@ etz where you stand the symbol . &quot;
&quot; created a new icon . if the current file has been altered , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . then there is a dialog where you can choose whether the icon is to be created by a template , or whether you want to start from scratch . &quot;
&quot; again , the last und@@ o @-@ made step returns again . if you do not have taken a step back , this feature is disabled . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I Module Images provide tools available to take new pictures and add it out .
&quot; this module can be used to invite new images to both the external sources and to send it down . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
images sc@@ ans : use K@@ oo@@ ka interface to reading images from a scanner technology supported by the SAN@@ E project or another source like video streams . so this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SAN@@ E .
&quot; in case you open the menu item , a dialog that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . you can also choose the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will replace your own window by selecting the default default values in order to select your image accordingly . the cher@@ ished file size is displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
be sure that the window is completely displayed as some settings otherwise will not be displayed .
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to fix the Options set . here you can select the com@@ pression and the type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image saved . &quot;
you can create screen@@ caps once you have chosen in the menu Im@@ por@@ tier@@ ite &gt; screens : a window appears in which you can set the various monitors :
select The complete desktop reading in order to insert a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all own program window is selected , the vo@@ ic@@ able program will disappear , so you will see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will be read after a short delay to check the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the entire desktop reading only the window is read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screens will wait before it starts . in case you need to switch on other working spaces , you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screenshot is made , the dialog options of the target image , with the options described above . &quot;

&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization is available for images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo to loc@@ alize . height , long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tudes are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your images with geographical information , you need a GPS track as XML @-@ file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and give the menu on . the top to viewing dialog will then download . this file contains of course data that were added at the same time at the same locations , as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
if the file loaded a automatic cor@@ relation which shows the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera @-@ time has to be calculated with GMT . this can be done with the time@@ zone . place your camera @-@ zone here .
the setting for the maximum time vari@@ ance is a high devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera . if the devi@@ ation below are the data mer@@ ged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have don@@ or data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the tim@@ difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you don &apos;t have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ alization in a large time@@ difference between camera and GPS lies , you can put these limits here and then push the button cor@@ related to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set up with this dialog manually . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . as dialogue with a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ alization can also be found and set up and set . select the relevant region and enlarge you see it again , until you have reached a sufficiently high level of accuracy . the map must always be selected manually . the map can be changed manually . the map can be changed manually . &quot;
completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang onto the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ er tool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Modul picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML sites .
&quot; this module can export your albums into a picture gallery , from HTML sites to version 4.01 . you can choose the albums to be exported to HTML sites . the character set for UT@@ F @-@ 8 is coded to provide a best internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four riders , which can be adapted to the settings . the rider selection allows you to choose all albums which are to be exported to HTML . with the three buttons on the right , you will quickly find a large number of albums . in the area include the alert and the text of the HTML page appears . &quot;
&quot; the rider appearance clearly defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely declared itself . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the picture is displayed directly with your standard feature , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show . &quot;
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your related pictures . select a folder that contains the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default colour deep water . it also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the rider Th@@ umb@@ nails will allow you some of the settings from the album Rider for the Th@@ umb@@ nails , which are small images to be displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window indicates the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break down the process .
&quot; if the module created the pages , the window will not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program@@ m@@ ations to determine if errors throughout the production . the web browser will be launched automatically at the end to preview the preview of Gallery . press closing to include the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I imag@@ ery is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to look at pictures .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I imag@@ ery is allowed to view a selection of pictures and to carry on them basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or rel@@ oc@@ ating . he has been used for quick image and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown by default in full mode . this can change in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG &apos;s lu@@ st@@ ine module is a tool to change pictures without imp@@ air your quality .
&quot; this module allows to store for the actions listed below , images in the JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses to quality or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the lu@@ cid storage is it climb@@ s the file size , as no com@@ pressing the color information takes place . for example , this can be used e.g. at the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to enable you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client still has no documentation . in case you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ .org . note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata module currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team . &quot;
&quot; with the import -@@ function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the file optional dialog with which you want to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data is copied after you pushed onto the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work in all formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not to any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check out exi@@ ve 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a sli@@ deshow .
&quot; the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG @-@ video , using a defined length , using a defined length , you can also insert the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images , you can also add a audio file in the MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; all images will automatically select to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select an wall@@ paint for the sli@@ deshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; you must first select the pictures to be packed into the MPEG sli@@ deshow . afterwards , you can launch via extras , MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . &quot;
the pictures selected from you are then displayed under picture files in the portfolio . there you can also change sor@@ ting of images or content of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be chosen from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and CD . PAL is set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds which will display a picture . the speed of the image above is specified below . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
the background colour can be set next . in doubt you should leave it black . the name and the path of the generated file can be set under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . retain as the extension mp@@ g as possible .
&quot; if you specify a audio file under name of audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your machine , you can get a coffee with the button code . depending on the speed of your computer you can enjoy a coffee and enjoy the sli@@ deshow if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right bottom . &quot;
the printer assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo@@ sizes . this is e.@@ g : sensible to print you or print with the Gimp module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command @-@ head@@ lines d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original feature of Dave is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your cam@@ er@@ ah@@ er@@ ers . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file , and run the module . the raw image converted window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now re@@ boot the values new to optimize the converting process . the first option decides if the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the key parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be j@@ us@@ hed . if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a quad@@ rant R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the appropriate information , so if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion base . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains equal and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a distor@@ ted algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tag@@ ged Image format , T@@ IF@@ F , maintains all the information of your image and uses the lu@@ st@@ ine L@@ Z@@ W com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise otherwise you should not use the JP@@ EG format , as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to select JP@@ EG as the storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is included in the RA@@ W file in the JP@@ EG file in the ex @-@ file information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion . in case you want to break this process back then you can use this process . &quot;
&quot; the st@@ acker processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time . therefore , use this mode for instance , e.g. by testing in a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the options available are virtually identical to the version for individual images . here , however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write the file . this is useful if this in a previous attempt has been created . a preview is not available how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to un@@ com@@ press all images in one album , using the program also from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported : &quot;
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can fix the pre@@ fix , which should be used to start number and tim@@ est@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to modify the size of multiple images in a collection of images . it is using the program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can enlarge the picture , or enlarge , four types of image change will be made available : &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot;
not propor@@ tionally : not proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; printing preparation : preparing the picture for the photo print . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ api@@ ers . the target image , including background size , edge size and wall@@ paint , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images using your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the sending pictures previously . more images can draw on the list of pictures to be drawn .
&quot; after you started the module , the images window will be displayed in the pictures selected by you . you can add more images to the button with a file @-@ op@@ tionally . for the last selected picture , a preview page will be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also draw pictures on the picture list and add it there to add the list of images to the pictures .
with the kno@@ b images you will remove images from the list of the images below .
&quot; after you have selected all the pictures , you can use the button OK with the button OK , the new message -@@ window of your e @-@ mail . you only need to add the addresses and the header pages here . the pictures selected are attached . &quot;
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and every@@ time used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . in case you select Thunder@@ bird so you must specify the correct path for your installation .
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you have to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the election of comments in a raised file , the comments to the images will be added to a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files but it &apos;s best adapted among lu@@ st@@ air formats like T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JP@@ EG format .
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG under images file format and the original files in JP@@ EG format are , then the original files are added to the images added to the images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window is not automatically closed for you to view the status messages , in search of errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be launched automatically at the end . with the button , you can ch@@ ill this window ? &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced , sli@@ deshow appears to have a window with questions like you have shown your sli@@ deshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL transitions at the presentation are activated very elegant image transitions through OpenGL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the sli@@ deshow will be very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images in the lower left corner will be displayed during the presentation .
the ph@@ one@@ p option makes it possible to display the presentation in a continuous loop . you can then manually ab@@ rupt then with Es@@ c .
the option images to happen by chance ensures that the images are shown in an acci@@ dental order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
&quot; with delay between the images , the time @-@ time gap can be placed between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transitions between which you can choose . by chance choosing a different effect during each transition between pictures .
&quot; during the sli@@ deshow , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can view the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ ks currently has no documentation . in case you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ .org . note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background picture is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the work@@ space .
&quot; this module is currently using selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub @-@ menu , as a background for your KDE labels . &quot;
&quot; if you have provided your pictures and videos with any comments , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , then in person , locations and in the group keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you see the categories , for which you have provided information than you have provided your images and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information that view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course look at the current view@@ points . in the following , each one is described here . &quot;
if you press the mouse on the entry of the picture changes the view of the browser . see picture .
&quot; when you select a further person only the pictures are displayed , on which both individuals are to be seen . through this selection method you can restrict the number of the displayed images of a few thousand pictures on a few more pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view th@@ umb@@ nails to view the pictures of your activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same icon in front of their name . however , you can save his own image , which is of course also available for places , keywords , and other categories that you have defined themselves . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images in addition to the name , select the button that you need to use the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of people and at the same time a list of key@@ word ( if you do not have appropriate images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to determine which image for each individual person is to be displayed . now you can choose the picture item window , as shown in the picture . here you can custom@@ ize the image factor to your wishes and choose which part of the picture is to be displayed and can be cut . &quot;
&quot; once you call in the main window the entry Su@@ chen , a dialog will be shown that is very similar to the dialogue to fix the image features . this dialog can look at the picture once more . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string into the lab@@ eling or description , the compl@@ ementary text or descriptions of images will be sear@@ ched for this text . if you like , you can also enter a date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here you will see some pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . if you do not like to read manu@@ als , but rather like to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and look at the quick@@ est , the screen@@ caps and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and select in the first dialogue the demo , in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , for the first time , or select in the menu for the menu item , photo album ; subsequently , some example will be loaded and you can try out the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as a coher@@ ent HTML document . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this body you see here : . as the name suggests , this ly@@ e @-@ statistics shows you about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you multiple different periods of time . each body then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by pointing the bar only 10 minutes sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can edit the displayed message view from the database ( if you select a date , the tim@@ eline is always shown the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time bar , so if you select an area , you &apos;ll select only pictures of this period . you can pick out the selection by clicking on a beams of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album Federn will provide you with two options available to create HTML @-@ websites with your images . the one is integrated into &amp; k@@ photo@@ etch ; integrated in the following part of the user photo album . integrated version described you can set up using HTML file .
&quot; before HTML pages you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and finish . in the following , each area is exactly described more exactly . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the survi@@ vor@@ s and a description that is to contain HTML file . on k@@ photo@@ album , HTML @-@ sample pages you see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can be created ; or export file is to be displayed on the Over@@ view page . information about the export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . therefore , you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer . at the moment all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific images from certain spect@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can define how to look at HTML @-@ sites . most settings are clear , which is why not specifically entered . &quot;
&quot; below you can set various resolutions for the pictures . therefore , those who have to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images do not download the maximum resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the spect@@ ator of your side may change the resolution at any time . so , it can browse your pictures with low resolution , resulting in a lower transmission time , as if he wants to get a picture larger , he switches to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this introduc@@ tory section , you set the different folder and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; it is best to choose for all your HTML files , and for every subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder is automatically generated and you can select for all future pictures of the location . here you can either select a folder or a KDE sponsor protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you created your images , you can check if this really all can be displayed for viewers . if you have created a URL for the base folder , the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will launch in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the file you created by you , you do not need to copy them manually . so that the import function , see correctly , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; the settings described above have described all three on base folders and URLs . in these , a sub @-@ folder created , whose name you can specify in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you encounter a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you might want to create your pictures with these images . you can of course create a HTML page to consider the pictures , reception , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . this work will not even happen . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import and import others into your database . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the images are stored in the file , or if the file is only a short@@ cut to the file , that you can share all images to the file , however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu File or together with HTML sites , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this becomes an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; a external .@@ k@@ im file searches for the pictures in a two @-@ fold way . first , the images are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . of course , the images of the URL you have indicated to create HTML files . this is of course only possible when you created your .@@ k@@ im file by using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog will be descri@@ bing for the export of images which you can export through the menu File . &quot;
the main option of this dialogue is whether it should be about internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available to you :
&quot; when you choose to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atic to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the pictures automatically copy for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures already have been com@@ pressed and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not com@@ pressed the files . if you would like to do this simply select the option export file .
&quot; the last option of this site is maximum image size . if you want to send your friends images , you might not want to send the images in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large . here you can limit the size by saying , for example , that every picture is a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file Im@@ por@@ ters ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to Im@@ por@@ ate consists of four steps . first , you have to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import@@ ing images to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you can import the category person to the import@@ ing file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is to be imported into the third dialogue window , which categories of the imported file will be imported and which categories are to be imported into your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can import the categories of the import@@ ing file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be simple to browse and look at : if you look at pictures , you can often look inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to view photos of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this hand@@ book you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) Fest@@ ing the information about your images , via ( 2 ) the finding and prestige , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adapt@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for the pamper@@ ing of your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often it also closes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file ; saves all its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file , which you can backup on a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where they would like . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notices the folder in which your images are stored and used in future starts . in case you want to launch another folder in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so you can launch a different folder in your photo album , with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / pictures / index@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry settings , you can set up ... get to a window by which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user &apos;s manual , you will be explained in the different settings . &quot;
&quot; to see the links you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings the review and options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help available , which you can view through a button shift to the F1 button and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; in it was described as you can choose different properties , e.g. individuals , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; to see the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each available group you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options you can set complete members , for example , all members of a group at once in a group , instead of explaining all the groups of a medi@@ ate as in . &quot;
&quot; in view the settings options that are available to you for fixing the member groups , you can choose the category you want to configure . in the left of the window , you can find a list of the current categories and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modu@@ l@@ system with other graphics applications such as Pres@@ sure and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . more information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu module . the modules can and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , but most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules . &quot;
&quot; since the modules can be used together with multiple applications each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album files ; demo database may always be tested with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album @-@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . say not , I would not have war@@ ned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that are using the modules on K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album will not work . this is the down@@ side when you share features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their pictures in albums : this type of order is not supported , simul@@ ated it for some modules the order after albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; thereby simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply matches the current view , so all pictures that shows you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
next to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album must also be transferred to a list of albums . here is a list of albums as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album &apos;s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category you have specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you choose for example the category persons , will have chosen &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you choose to choose this one and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; because some modules are not compatible with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the area modules , which modules are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see an example of a laun@@ ches , once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , see the window using the tool@@ bar , see the window , with which you can browse your picture database . however , in the section we will look back to this window , but now click on the entry photos , which shows you an overview with all the existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the opportunity to see each image associated with notes , where the image has been recorded . you can either re@@ configure each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures of Jes@@ per . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for seeking and browsing , as you can read in the section , be used . if you want to see these comments if you use the embedded viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by choosing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album because you will always use them again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to drag the images within the list : if you have , for example , have a family party and are shown in all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons you can find that the used names are moved upwards , can find the person faster and arrange . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting after date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected any comments for each image individually , you might want to edit all selected images and add these images with notes . simply click on the front and return buttons , which are located at the right top of the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at one time with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you see a browser window that shows the US as a sub@@ group . to show you that it is an excess group , a special symbol is shown . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the menu @-@ menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also draw an entry on a category and set it here to locate this to a sub@@ category of this entry . please note that you are exactly your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this . &quot;
&quot; you can shift the individual elements of the same condition by moving the cor@@ ds that form the top of the frame , anch@@ oring and postp@@ one . you can also make your own window by drawing him outside the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... which offers you the possibility to store the current construction and appearance of the window . &quot;
you can also get a frame complete out . if you want to see this window later on , use the button options ... and here window a / bl@@ ending . this procedure will see you in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the entry images in the browser , you will find an overview of the pictures currently selected , or all images if you do not have a filter . you can configure the size of the Th@@ umb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simple . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture will be set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture section . if you have not yet opened a window with an image feature , a new ad window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can delete images in the picture , and select either the removal button or select either the removal button or select in the menu item Edit selection . now , the window will be shown you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; for this problem , you can use a solution for this problem . you can also use this problem with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . you can also use the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the pictures are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ photo album ; you can view the preview of these images . however , you can also view these pictures with the picture . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and want to copy again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you want to avoid the penetration of your images , please buy a bigger disk in order to save all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures , you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can filter the pictures so that you can see for others un@@ accessible and click Out@@ let View Samples in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also click all the pictures that can view your little sister , cont@@ actors and the menu item everything out of contemporary view . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , you set out which pictures are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop now your little sister , allowing all pictures that you have locked up closed . if you want to see the pictures again , click Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that must be entered to un@@ locking the pictures . to set up this password , simply change your password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture protection is not quite safe at all times . to access the file index@@ .x@@ ml you can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is not familiar with those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , not very familiar to ad@@ ress the views of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason you can see all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; ad@@ minister and hours over hours thus you can see , of course that you want to consider it sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has an image and video views . you can preview them from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer is able to see in . he is of course the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture , for example who is on the picture , when and where was it done etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , then you can simply drag it with your mouse and can also configure it differently . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . then , the appearing context menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , see , matching entries to this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have chosen the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture high and finish . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as a sli@@ deshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then invites you a new image after a few seconds . as frequently , there is a new image to be controlled by pressing the Str@@ g button and plus or minus . and stopped the sli@@ deshow through the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; s . &quot;
&quot; a very useful ability of the beh@@ older of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , is it in full mode change . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full mode and return . &quot;
if you use the viewer you can move in the picture and extract zo@@ oming . with the mouse button you can easily get a rect@@ angle the plus button zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . showing how a z@@ oom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
&quot; with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the picture is not shown zo@@ omed . with the Equ@@ al key indicates the zo@@ oms , allowing each pixel to the screen a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations will work with videos that are in and challenging zo@@ oming with the plus and feature key .
&quot; with the filming from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the actual picture with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
if you look at pictures it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can watch the image ab@@ break and configuration dialog of the picture to input this name . however you &apos;ll be able to highlight the picture and see more pictures .
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer , to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and see them as good or bad , while you view one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the spect@@ ator gives you the chance to add pictures with characteristic , while you view it . features are the letters A to Z and you can press a characteristic that you press the appropriate letters . see an image where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set traits on your pictures , they are available in your browser . you can see all of the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features may be displayed in the view view . if you click Categ@@ ories in the view view , then you can press Features to the pictures by clicking the letter for the characteristic , after the picture has been selected . this you can see here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for that case allowed you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album allowed on the picture to paint .
&quot; the painted is not stored with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o ate your mind later . &quot;
&quot; in case you can see a picture on the painted picture . to turn off the painting line from the context menu . to switch off the painting menu from the context menu . to finish the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling , you need to master the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray ; you should be read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties properties and presented the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple items at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub @-@ items are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the item where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; there are multiple possible positions , the following pop@@ up menu appears , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with delet@@ ing either from the menu bar , or from the context menu or the context menu of the right mouse button , you can previously remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have altered properties , click here to take these changes . have invali@@ d values entered , you will correct a message with a error description . then you can correct the input holes and click on the changes made with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to the Pov@@ ray ; user &apos;s documentation in the interior dialog , you can view the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the indicated object with the help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user &apos;s documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is described with the chosen texture . as a default , the entire texture is covered , even if you want to choose a part of texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross it locally . &quot;
the screenshot shows the points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse buttons and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a wire model . you can specify this value relatively to the visibility of the higher level , or as absolute value . objects are only then displayed when they are selected or their visibility level smaller , or equal to the tool@@ bar chosen by the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling , has a window order as a default . the object view and the view of the item properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you do not like the standard window order , or if you need a different order , you can also save them as you like . you can also store several window arrangements and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
to be a window on or below a present view , drag the starter to the top or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to classi@@ fy multiple views on each other , drag the starter in the middle of another view . you can then change between views through clicking on the cart@@ on top of the views above . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window disorder are de@@ we@@ eping views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the starter on the desktop , or click on the small to the left top arrow in the fi@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the bar bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and cross . &quot;
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for any type of views . new views are ho@@ vering , you can anchor them at any point . &quot;
the current window view can save you with view window and store ... it will display a dialog where you can save the window system under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be properly installed . when this manual was written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling , version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon ren@@ dering the symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu view preview . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in various image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender @-@ modes , from a quick preview to full photos of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; click on the symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender Mode has a name . you can type each name , but it is a name that can detect the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size , you can insert the width and height of the framed image . if you want only one small area of the picture , select the cross section and enter the cli@@ pping section to ren@@ dering into the input field . &quot;
&quot; in the combination field quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refl@@ ections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual on &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is controlled with just a beam per pixel , there are often different mistakes . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è @-@ pattern or di@@ ps effects in cur@@ ves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing turn and connects and Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam each pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling system is adapted . the second method is adapted and adap@@ tive because every pixel is constantly being split and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion@@ ists depends on the calculated dy@@ eing .
&quot; if you choose the first method , pursu@@ es POV @-@ Ray a ray each . if you set the difference between the paint to the neigh@@ b@@ ted pixel . if you set the low value on 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , with a low value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixel is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel ; r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the paint values the pre@@ determined threshold , the pixel is divided in 4 sub@@ pixel that are individually pursued and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be set with the low value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of smoking for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn off J@@ it@@ tering , changes in Pov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use Refl@@ ex@@ . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use of light flexibility . it takes a long time to calculate one scene with this property . &quot;
on this map you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not met an object .
&quot; open a new window to display the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; unexpected , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; select the menu item imports ... and select a file in the dialogue window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; still does not support the complete command circum@@ ference of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if in the import of error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support HTML @-@ text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; please write this code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ o@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source code in the editor , the text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply tick the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; and in your editor you can also insert source code for your Pov@@ ray .
the POV @-@ Ray @-@ command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; a scene ren@@ dering . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; click on aid in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation on the indicated object . place the path to your documentation and the version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; for external files ( for example , al@@ locate data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if you apply files that are not in the folder of the scene , you &apos;ll also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the refl@@ ector in the camera view and in the window type labels .
&quot; you can adjust the object of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire menu of the wire model . you can set the grid separately for shifting , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the indicated objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail level for two directions separately . &quot;
&quot; if you drop the high level model for enhanced proj@@ ections , all the wire model views are further structured , if the camera is an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to perspective and sen@@ k@@ right proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; if you display wall on display , a wall behind the objects are rounded . the wall is shown in a chess boards of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you display soil , a floor is cleared beneath the objects . the floor is shown in a ch@@ ecker @-@ board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate cant@@ een , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be used . more precise information about the parameters you can find in section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window app@@ liance . in the section window arrangements , you can create and save window app@@ ings . &quot;
the combination field standard window order : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order in the start of the program .
the list available window arrangements shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create adding with the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; and select a select arrangement with the button . &quot;
any window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name reveals all views for the selected window order . new views can create cri@@ tici@@ zed with the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; and select selected views with the button . &quot;
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , you will create a new column on the right of the available window , with Un@@ ten anchor you get the window below the available window , with cardboard card , you get a card @-@ card view together with the previous view and shi@@ vering the view not in the main window but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; installed and now you want to follow without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you are following all steps in this guide , you should be able to make the ultimate but simple scene , which are very popular among beginners : a sphere of a plane . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings to complain that you will receive as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for example , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for ren@@ dering , as a result you will receive a black image . &quot;
&quot; insert not light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will only receive a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed all error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ek@@ er ; the following lists : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can expect an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their applications . &quot;
&quot; to follow this guide , starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item editing . you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene that you create . in particular , this is the scene of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view properties which can be found in the different parameters of the camera . in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; please find more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is later reserved , but note that the camera will change in the View Control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you are applying the button or press En@@ ter , the wire model views and the lens will immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert for example a squ@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 set , but that &apos;s a viable method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; offers actually a simple way . you can use an infinite level as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the plane in the tree @-@ tree , change the name and then press the button . in the lens set the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ re@@ model view also shows the level , although at the moment only as a limited level . if you see the scene , the level extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the object tree exactly , you will notice that you click on the icon for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the item properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the ground up to exercise a unit among the horizont@@ ally , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as below : &quot;
&quot; first , select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something from the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog will open in which you can choose how the object is inserted . please select the name in the object view . you can preview the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , as the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ment only shows a Matt@@ el black material because you can check settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , you are always interested in review the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also this gives you a lot of options , but take the easiest way . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color to the header and ball in the preview , click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the ground is right now . if you click on the icon with a click on the icon , you should get the following results : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . you need to enter two new attributes . please select this entry twice ( you can do it more frequently , but the Chess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; select in the area of jed@@ es@@ mal , and change the colors in the view of the property characteristics : &quot;
you should already be able to perform this step as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; they have already understood the ball just as easy as the ground :
&quot; in the view of the item Properties , you can immediately change the settings . Set the sphere for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the bul@@ ky or the button ) , so that the bul@@ let flow across the ground . otherwise , the bul@@ let would move over the bottom , since you postp@@ oned the bottom to move one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering result gives you a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a hard @-@ black material . put you in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material . as already in the floor , you give the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; choose your sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball Pig@@ ment . click P@@ ball Pig@@ ment , then select mon@@ ochro@@ me and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot;
change the values as in the following screenshot and click in applying and press En@@ ter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learned so much , that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ ay@@ cing is a deer @-@ method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you shoot a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the Ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the beh@@ older . the R@@ ender is calculated , as this beam have been calculated and broken , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as atmospheric effects such as fo@@ g effect . thus the scene pixels len@@ ght for pixel . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously you need any scene that should be saved , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously made with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub@@ menu and will replace the oldest one in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if there is a new file , you need to enter a name and space . &quot;
displays the scene in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
&quot; this menu item , you can only select if you do not have any stored changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; again , the last und@@ o @-@ made command . this menu item can only then select if you use mach@@ ining back@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; saves the current window order and opens a dialog , where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can edit or add new commands using this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool@@ tool@@ box for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; commands and remove .
&quot; a B@@ ump map is a way to measure out surfaces without any ben@@ ding on the surface individually , and without change the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic body are simple geomet@@ rical shapes , which you can use as components : very complex 3D models are created from do@@ zens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then re @-@ recorded to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object to pixel base by using an image file as a color card .
&quot; &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable painting feature and a browser . the application has a fil@@ es@@ Browser , where you can choose images to display . &quot;
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full mode .
use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can see with clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button Return .
you can adjust if any picture is to be displayed in your own window or if all images are always intended to use the same window .
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file in the browser window . then a small input field has been found in the lower right corner . if a suitable fil@@ en@@ ame is highlighted , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field through pressing of Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue entry and ball @-@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , general and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show . in the two other , short @-@ commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the picture is selected , the pictures are filled in full mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not a full @-@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; is this point activated , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a sli@@ deshow . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when carrying out the name of the last opened folder . at the next starting opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a wall@@ paint . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , is also filled here with the background with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can set &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , so set out that only some of the file types are displayed , which may display the program . &quot;
with this option the display pattern is increased to the full screen for large images . this option is switched as default .
determine if the sli@@ deshow is to begin with the first image in the folder or with the chosen image .
&quot; time span between the change in a sli@@ deshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow will be repeated until they enter the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the box maps for the display pattern and short@@ rest for the browser .
with this option you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
shows large symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short term .
shows small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short term .
shows Th@@ umb@@ nails for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short term .
shr@@ ink@@ le the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarged the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
closes the display pattern for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened more .
view the original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ tization ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; ist &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends that the user is contributing to its part at least problems and potential improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo puts you to report as easy as possible errors or possible improvements . here you will find a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and desires . all required information is already filled out and you can simply follow the instructions to release your message . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; show@@ photo . you can post here any questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo . in this mailing list however English is spoken carefully , you should therefore be power@@ less . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in the show@@ photo , it is the developer mailing list . to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; trying to give you much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that choose the behavior of the show@@ photo . you have to switch to these settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
&quot; in the area of supply indic@@ ative , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ layer indic@@ t@@ ator should be selected , if the sub@@ - or over@@ layer indic@@ t@@ ator should be selected , in contrast , a bright colour and over@@ exposure should display a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; owns a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view this page bar where you can click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to sc@@ ans images that do not make more power than images to scan and visu@@ alize images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to sc@@ ans images which can no longer use as pictures to scan and store the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can display the images before image .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SAN@@ E Proj@@ ective page by placing the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner was not opened or if no standard scanner is created then a dialog for the selection of the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and push OK to open the scanner . ab@@ rupt it will end .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) treats these options especially .
&quot; to view an image , the user can only start a preview @-@ can and then start scanning area for the final scan . preview is started by preview button . &quot;
to select the image better the user can enter into the image and out of the current selection zo@@ oming . he can also adjust the z@@ oom so that the entire announcement fits into the window .
when the picture has been selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when on the stor@@ ing a preview display in the settings is selected , then the picture is shown in a pad@@ lock , as shown below , then the image is stored and sl@@ ey ? en leads to a break@@ down and you get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the kno@@ b settings , the ep@@ onymous dialogue will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image , if desired , before reading . in this case the option is to be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; images to pick up the dialog for each picture opens . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite will open the dialog with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must also choose to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this option defines where the images stored with the option Save after a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the pictures are stored after each scan , this folder is used as default for dialogue to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a pre@@ fix for the automatically re@@ activated images and is moreover the proposed name for the image in dialog to save . the automatically stored image is automatically added , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the quality used for saving image quality . this value also changes the com@@ pression value in the store . if you select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the kno@@ b help starts the KDE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button about starts the KDE News -@@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these cuts and their function . the global key@@ boards are set up by clicking with right mouse button in the player window and choose glob@@ es short@@ cuts you can click with the right mouse button in the player window and choose un@@ rest ... select .
&quot; you may set up available multimedia buttons as well , that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short command . thus , turn your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ control centre . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly also shown in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of Collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function could be like : &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command lines options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script is not executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script , whether all necessary modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user ID is not running . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum ( KDE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is and for this script . &apos; in dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / Tour you will find a lot of template @-@ scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts , or simply create the required features . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can control with Amar@@ in and Amar@@ in . the easiest way is the use of command d@@ co@@ p ; which should include all KDE @-@ installation . &quot;
&quot; most of the scrip@@ ting languages allow the output of external programmes and commands . in this way , it is usually used to function ex@@ ec &gt; relatively easy . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this reason , strings on the default script should be monitored continuously and accordingly respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to view the furnis@@ hing dialog . to store the store and loading of the furnis@@ hing data , a script should take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ ok continues the work folder on the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ change is sign@@ aled that a new piece is stimul@@ ated . the script could well ask for example ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the st@@ umps ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alized a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger : between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ - Get sub@@ menu and item@@ ized Menu Tit@@ le may also be passed on to add an entry to the select files of the playlist . to remove an entry , the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok , finish , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ in ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do such as au@@ sp@@ aci@@ ousness . for example , the saving of data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ oks script administration can also install script packages , which has downloaded the user &amp; eg ; such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which can be optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ in ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Exten@@ ding amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script packages right . &quot;
&quot; the main cri@@ pts must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest of the lad@@ der modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is done , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and connect the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can easily move into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you are looking for a very specific title made of thousands of your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting browsers and the quick look you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists are still hard for you . and if the decision is still heavily , select the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ ri@@ ver IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , such as you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ o@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to see your music new ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one has to compile and install Amar@@ o@@ on sources in the base folder to compile and install Amar@@ in . &quot;
&quot; because &amp; Amar@@ ok , auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not encounter any difficulty in the compilation . if you encounter any problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ in ; has , like most applications some options , which you can activate or de@@ activate the configure script with the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies must be fulfilled , so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements . &quot;
&quot; enabled de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok , can be set up without trouble using the interior dialog . the interior dialog has several cards of cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; player window will display the player window in addition to the playlist , or if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window is sho@@ wn@@ ju@@ K ) . &quot;
&quot; voting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok , compiled with support for m@@ oo@@ dy . the option turns the experimental function of the m@@ oods . &quot;
&quot; shaping : this feature is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok , is compiled with support for m@@ oo@@ dy . this is the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; voting files in the music files are available : this feature is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok , are compiled with support for m@@ oo@@ dy . otherwise , the .@@ mood files stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok , ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ oo@@ dy / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browsers will run from &amp; Amar@@ ok , when a browser is required . &quot;
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list .
&quot; playlist upon loading , store the current playlist automatically when loading &amp; Amar@@ in ; activate this option if you want to lose the current playlist upon payment . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , a relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be stored . &quot;
&quot; actual play can be seen in the piece of change , that the play@@ lists window is up @-@ up - / roll@@ out , in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing the context in the context of the context , it automatically displays the context of the browser as soon as the next piece is tr@@ acked . &quot;
in the section Ap@@ pear@@ ance you can adapt &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts under@@ part .
&quot; in the font section you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ in ; you can select fonts for the following section : play@@ lists window , player window and context browser . press on expres@@ sing ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme , you even have the tor@@ ment of choice and can set its own color scheme . use the activated color selection for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; play@@ back to the start brings that &amp; Amar@@ in ; after the program start recording the play automatically with the piece on the place , with which they stopped in the last bow . &quot;
&quot; the Sub@@ window On @-@ screen display allows you to switch off the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this review . &quot;
the first option is the font . click select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the cross @-@ box shadow causes the text in the O@@ SD sh@@ aded .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the opportunity to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . one click on the color @-@ surfaces opens the dialog to color selection . when peculi@@ ar colors are not activated , the pre @-@ manufactured &amp; k@@ iller is used . &quot;
the input field display text represents the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by type of space reserved the O@@ SD card can be adjusted . below you will find a list of available space holder and what they mean .
the screen screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to determine which screen a multi@@ fold monitor environment should appear to O@@ SD .
the card @-@ card audio version lets you choose an audio driver from the selection range . some drivers can activate even further settings in this map .
the map collection will be used for att@@ acking all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , search &amp; Amar@@ in ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the An@@ kreu@@ z next to his name . this section also contains an@@ ow@@ l fields to provide how with the selected folders . &quot;
Sub@@ scri@@ bed reproduce : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to music are well connected .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ in ; to monitor the selected folder of changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , a incre@@ mental search will be added to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ in ; all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will be added later in the play@@ lists .
part collection @-@ database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected still further establishment in the window My@@ S@@ ql furnishings .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql @-@ establishment section is used for installation of the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok , where the computer is entered . after that , under port : the network port is entered , where the database is accessible . name : is the database name , which is connected to the database . &quot;
use U@@ ser@@ name : and password : for example the data that is needed for connection to the database .
the cardboard boxes last@@ .@@ f@@ m is the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m ein . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can provide the names of r@@ arities to a bur@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations concerning the current piece .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your duty .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; sending pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok , to transmit the names of the played pieces to your duty .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
similar artists retri@@ eve : according to activ@@ ating this attitude &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the each played play . note : you can use the list in the context of the browser . note : you do not need load @-@ duty profile to be able to use this feature .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok , is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with the screenshot . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok requires only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you need to find k@@ deli@@ bs , because &amp; Amar@@ in ; requires some of them to find such as modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features such as O@@ SD susp@@ ects that your window manager supports the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . GNO@@ ME will thus work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties . we try to assist Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these constitute an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can see the file out@@ fit in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log in . please report this bug to delete the crash file . afterwards you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly it is that day@@ lib reading the reading of the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers below bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok , is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok , used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version have been compiled . in case of B. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x have been compiled , then this leads to ab@@ rupt the mach@@ ining of met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate your machine if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) , and you can send us a good background , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because a lot of program data can write as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but this can not be identified as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / perl the &quot; file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = print _ v@@ 2@@ day ; print &quot; error in writing the tags of $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ day ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ E &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the stat@@ us@@ bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic playlist ) can be easily forgotten in the Control Center . this is a well known bug on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this option shows its effect .
if you get this mistake : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ oc@@ app : un@@ subscri@@ bed symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this allows you to see with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos;@@ _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ zing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so adapt that Amar@@ ok is the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation issues are easiest through the assistance of an expert of your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and the IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one mistake if something lies at the removal of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist will appear . how can there be music pieces ?
&quot; that is easy . use the file browser to the left and open the folder , then drag the files to the right part of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window into the Statisti@@ cs window has been converted . you will find it under Extr@@ as statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist and select column review . click anywhere in the list of the playlist . you can also use the short@@ list of Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works , when Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select playlist from the pop@@ up menu .
drag a playlist to the playlist and let them fall exactly as you would do with other files . so simple is this : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Add @-@ button , you can save the button playlist . click it . &quot;
probably missing the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look to lib@@ visual that package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . also you will find it via the menu bar under extras
&quot; no . yes , this really is ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real issue is supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every conceivable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG . &quot;
&quot; it can ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default there is no MP3 @-@ Dek@@ or co @-@ supplied ( from pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter &quot;
run the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ C@@ amer driver with the AL@@ SA S@@ ink , the device must use a mix@@ er . a bl@@ ender allows several applications to easily use the device at the same time and can be achieved with a sound controller ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix -@@ module for AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; the issue of this command should help you find the problem of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you might need to specify a different thing ( e.g. os@@ s@@ ham ) . &quot;
&quot; this is doing it &amp; Amar@@ ok , already . do not forget that media is first to de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is for most people the best choice when you &apos;re looking for a de@@ coder with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly on AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System ( warning to the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per su@@ id is set :
&quot; with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause st@@ acked play@@ back . read this bug report . the enlar@@ ging of the sound bu@@ ffer in your AL@@ SA furniture file .@@ aso@@ und r@@ c can also help well . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts drivers , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE Multimedia complete to get the fastest Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in control centre and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buff@@ ers , the fewer s@@ lugg@@ ers react to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ in ; from . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( stop Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download you to download , compile and install it . run the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder of G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register again . now , run &amp; Amar@@ in . &quot;
please tell about it at bug@@ s.@@ k@@ .org . if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes please send them to our mail@@ ing@@ list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . also the name is the magic K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program and allow the alarm to perform this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play
&quot; this command can be started &amp; Amar@@ ok , playing back . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running before going to bed , then you get out of the gentle tones of music that you have stopped in front of the bed . &quot;
how can you find current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ? go titles when one is on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . diesel instruction gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ o@@ player now@@ ro@@ aying
replace IP @-@ address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA is available .
&quot; the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window separate , press this on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size of modi@@ fiable window . &quot;
&quot; the combination of Str@@ g + Rights mouse button puts a piece in the queue in the queue . by pressing the input cell after a search in the playlist , the first search results will be played and the search returned . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and playlist you have tri@@ ck@@ ly functions , but what about the icon in the Control Panel series ? &quot;
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after starting from Amar@@ ok the collection database may not be created and the console appear many errors . what now ?
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; insert the CD a , then click in the menu on audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . to the normal folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic ex@@ cre@@ ed you will instead take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ string ( &quot; SELE@@ CT play@@ counter , creat@@ ed@@ ate , with F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( ur@@ l ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this does not fit the previous review with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play was played , the less influence has each individual rating on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking on a sp@@ readsheet in the play@@ lists window . there you can click the rating of a piece , just like any other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece and edit : rating or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating also in the dialog met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not wish to announce that you are to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have a fixed release plan , which will not coinci@@ de with the short term plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , that some users can also find also ner@@ vi@@ g . dis@@ able the option symbol for play@@ back in general settings . &quot;
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . choose settings for tool@@ bar and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design or create your own . install this then on Amar@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click New Design to install .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
connectivity options allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ in ; while you are in the kon@@ quer@@ or brow@@ ses . then click on the button Settings ( the top ) and select in the pop@@ up menu Hin@@ d@@ Amar@@ ok .
audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to be sent to information on which pieces on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and a password . audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of t@@ aps and thus also causes a lot of bug reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok was compiled before you have x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile this output modules . you have to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ configure and install .
&quot; now I have installed &amp; Amar@@ ok , new installed , but the output modules still does not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; probably use a distribution , which is installed by the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed , the same applies also for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install Amar@@ in . &quot;
I get the bug G@@ Stre@@ amer Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos;s has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ streams has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking . it is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : we don &apos;t compile L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ in .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to be mp@@ 4 or M4@@ A files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , it needs to be installed beside g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module . &quot;
you will receive the fault There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype io / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play a MP3 @-@ stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system managed G@@ ST register . then you start Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
under settings Amar@@ o@@ ok up ... audio output enter the device . typical of e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ aso@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Co@@ dec and an USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ int@@ el@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug @-@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ int@@ el@@ 8x@@ 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug @-@ audio { type plug @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; type in the interior dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio is , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the check @-@ up , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not taken care of you . you may want to take this problem yourself in your hand ! if you like , you can get the new so much needed super@@ vis@@ ors for Arts : ) &quot;

&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continually grow , the setting for coming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will be double in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces are played under consideration of hi@@ ring pieces . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces have been played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added after each played piece to playlist . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you want to add multiple playlist , random pieces from each of the crossed play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow own settings . you can custom@@ ize the settings by clicking the script and then click on installation .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ in ; scripts , install by clicking on script . once you install the script , a new entry is installed on the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet . you can also use the script further script . &quot;

cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Dis@@ cs Digital Audio ) . on the internet these programs are referred to as ri@@ pper .
&quot; og@@ g Pre@@ bis library : og@@ g is a completely open , patented and professional technology available for audio @-@ coding and for handling audio data currents . this library is from open source and is used in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Pre@@ bis Dec@@ o@@ der@@ - and En@@ coder modules . &quot;
&quot; MA@@ D : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio dé@@ c@@ or . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 @-@ Dec@@ oder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a far developed MP3 de@@ coder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ En@@ coder module .
FL@@ AC : a free open source co@@ dec for lu@@ st@@ free audio com@@ pression and de@@ com@@ pression . it is used by FL@@ AC @-@ Dec@@ oder module and the external audio @-@ coder module so you can read FL@@ AC files .
&quot; Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FL@@ AC , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ code W@@ MA files to us@@ en.@@ de@@ co . &quot;
SO@@ x : a relief program used between different audio formats - and can be extrac@@ ted . SO@@ x is used by the SO@@ x Audio En@@ coder module .

&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a full @-@ equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ sing of video CDs and Super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to suit the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be used for example to create rented CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different cav@@ eat of the various albums lead to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces will vary according to each other . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically reproduce all videos in the base folder .
&quot; this is a convenient way , recently opened projects again . the related sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project was already stored once , the previous file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; stores the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . KDE &apos;s dialog Save Target As is displayed , with which you can choose the folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file . &quot;
saves all open projects . this is the same as if you save for each single project file Save .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then check between Save and amendments . besides , you can also ab@@ rupt the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , will ask for every non @-@ stored project , which should happen to happen , just as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all open projects and termin@@ ates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project is asked , which should be done so as if you have called the file . &quot;
&quot; if you call this entry , you can move via the appearing dialogue files to add the project . this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; burning dialogue &quot; &quot; opens the dialogue &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialogue of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only open when the project contains already data . &quot;
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings ; most of them are described above the What is that ? -@@ help described ( reachable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . it &apos;s useful when you choose files for a multi @-@ meeting CD . this is useful if you are not used for a multiple meeting CD . this is useful for you to see the files already existing files and folders .
&quot; this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this feature set up files from the current project , and remove all other files in the project . this function does not remove files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD @-@ copying dialogue . this also allows the copying of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also want to burn just a picture from a CD . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should prefer to copy cl@@ ones if you &apos;d like to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copy @-@ copying dialogue . this allows even without project file to create a DVD on another medium . alternatively , you can also get to burn an image of a DVD with the help of cop@@ ing . hence , the target medium must be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source @-@ media in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
&quot; opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , making the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the typ@@ i@@ mod@@ i writing and incre@@ ment@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns an previously ground@@ ed CD @-@ image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which is then immediately supported by pressing the Br@@ enn@@ as button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns an previously created DVD release . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can immediately be burned through pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; an unprecedented DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window will usually be used after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used internally and even options for changing the size and the cut @-@ black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the relevant medium . this information is presented in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small body is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; folding the folder view or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . in case the contents view is activated , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media @-@ Info , locks and un@@ locking of the run or throwing the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view opens up or out . the contents view allows to choose and drag files to the project view . the contents view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided that a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; switched on the fl@@ esh@@ ste in the project view , or off . the p@@ est is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the p@@ est thing has no real function , it just looks pretty and separates the project view clear of the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window to change the key orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands is chosen in the upper part , one can adjust the keyboard order to it further down . &quot;
&quot; this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; tool assist@@ ants . so you can enter the correct per@@ missions to burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system @-@ Administr@@ ative rights , you must enter the password for the system administration ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here general programs can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on appeal . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and hos@@ tility of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface provided . with the help of this interface parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; use functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in function , so your taste and the type of your task will be crucial , which the teach programs you enter . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , which have all the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in common , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below . &quot;
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions for generating new projects . &quot;

as a result of such a creat@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you will receive a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : project D@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by means of # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface S@@ 3@@ b Interface S@@ 3@@ b Interface S@@ 3@@ b .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that is applicable only on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folder and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT C@@ s / foo d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT ROOM / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / foo / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ used for &amp; k@@ de ; with it , you can easily be saved audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder of the computer . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in W@@ AV files on the hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers who are used by default ( these Ko@@ di@@ erer packages still need to be installed from Linux distribution ) . further Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD will be read and recorded in W@@ AV files on the computer ( twi@@ sted and com@@ pressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step these W@@ AV files are com@@ pressed in a second step , com@@ pressed to the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or other formats such as lu@@ st@@ free FL@@ AC . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . nearly every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ ged @-@ up ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ atings are already available , so it &apos;s probably not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , only the co@@ atings store are not used , the installation is also not required . &quot;
&quot; which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ player / File format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and com@@ pressing factors . &quot;
&quot; a word about copying audio @-@ CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to cover any cop@@ ier protection . even if not the mechanisms of cop@@ ier protection , it is not possible to avoid the purchase of cop@@ ier audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the entry must be done only once ( the interior dialog can be found so often up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understanding the slim approach of the user interface , about which you may frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ erer programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can take &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is just a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step , you will find further information on how this program is used as well as the screenshot provided with descriptions of the regi@@ sters for the configuration of the program . &quot;
starting the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ dates according to the setup of request in the registry CD@@ DB . ( this may be locally or online in the latter case must first be made connection to the Internet . )
starts reading and - when a en@@ coder is configured in the registry entry settings in the interior catalogue - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the selection with a different en@@ coder can be read as the default . it is to be noted that the en@@ coder is configured in the registry entry settings in the interior dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the fil@@ es@@ manager , so that an already selected file is selected to code rather than a complete &amp; CD ; fl@@ ashing and bo@@ iling . &quot;
&quot; opens the tool dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as protocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for Program@@ mer@@ cies ( how to read the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various boxes cards ( such as En@@ coder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you need to go before the program can successfully be used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , codi@@ fication and com@@ pression @-@ rates and helps you choose the right body . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information should be lost , a lu@@ st@@ ale audio format is needed . besides FL@@ AC , there are also others like &quot; shor@@ ten &quot; or &quot; monkey &quot; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low com@@ pression @-@ rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among audio formats , the information given by data com@@ pression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG either have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both Ko@@ di@@ erer will produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will nevertheless be supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions . &quot;
+ high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ es ) but compared to O@@ GG slightly more profound quality in deeper bit@@ rates .
og@@ g - if only music is part of a machine or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG tran@@ smit@@ ters is present .
&quot; MP3 - when music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable equipment ( USB stick , memory card , disk ) or special car stere@@ otypes . today - initially 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list with parameters for audio quality and follow @-@ up com@@ pres@@ ets for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should normally offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &quot; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , com@@ pression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 MB = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , com@@ pres@@ sion rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , com@@ pres@@ sible rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and Auto@@ stere@@ o@@ systems . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &quot; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information , which are manually entered or by the program automatically obtained from the free@@ DB over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be delivered / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ program to create the folder and file name , as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with codi@@ le programs , there is often a combination of program@@ m@@ ations for the codi@@ fication and these parameters here . the manual or the help for the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ern declare the switch for these programs . &quot;
&quot; e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) , if MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the outcome looks like &quot; &quot; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = Kno@@ wing , in assist@@ ants ) : &quot;
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can download audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of writing yourself into the calcul@@ ator . it is to note that here only text is spoken by yourself : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I am legal , but I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; therefore , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music business cannot be added to any bum@@ ble@@ bee on a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a cross @-@ box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used for retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries , there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for the use of free@@ DB is set up , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally on the next lying mir@@ rors can be used . this saves band@@ width within the network and resem@@ bles the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a list of refl@@ ectors on the online call of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( generally created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading programme is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files to my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to know more exactly , search in source code .... It has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed first , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; for saving the W@@ AV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be chosen and thus the desired file format are chosen . in the opening lists are pre @-@ defined entry for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FL@@ AC ( air @-@ free com@@ pression for audio data ) on the tab . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer @-@ package must be installed from the particular Linux distribution system before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined co@@ aster . for more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er , you can get more information on his switch by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ ation window ( eg ; sole ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check out the device the device recording of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio @-@ Ko@@ di@@ erer of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a reference to what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envel@@ ope of &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is one chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will launch the program for the first time to set everything up and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
you must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . at least it is not necessary to compile data files as you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is composed and that you can own crying ( eg ; by trying to copy the kon@@ quer@@ or something to copy ) .
the first section covers the basic con@@ formity of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , what has to be repeated for any expres@@ sing &amp; CD . &quot;
here we determine the use of Ko@@ di@@ ers for com@@ pression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are lazy to share the program with you download the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be able to read it at any way out of a &amp; CD , once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device @-@ drawing will be delivered to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; common / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the actual device drawing of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , the effective device can also be accessed and an attempt with the existing entries are available for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map of general settings . here gi@@ b@@ ts can not do much . here , an additional transformation can be defined . in our example , everything will be shown as inserted in the screenshot . &quot;
&quot; only if you want to inqu@@ ire in full information , so you will be informed when data are missing from key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
the map card CD ; -@@ settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
&quot; note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during the reading &amp; CD , so that it can access the free@@ DB server . &quot;
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found will immediately be connected with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame directories / fil@@ en@@ ame or a day entries , they can easily change . the directory / fil@@ en@@ ame or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with con@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; day . &quot;
&quot; aside from this example is further to note : if you want to enter everything manually , you activate the selection fields and free@@ DB if you want to use the database before . however , this over 620 MB large , consider this twice whether this is worth it . to start free@@ DB in the Off@@ line mode , at least the first . the mode will be installed on the following map . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for data protection , for retri@@ eve the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server over the Internet . how does the system know how to get the CD ? read all the way it is shown in the screenshot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site , and look for a mir@@ r@@ ored server in your vicinity . however , this setting will be the first attempt to work . &quot;
&quot; both work independently of what the server concerns , since many fire@@ walls log the protocol 88@@ 80 standards , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to submit a &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first anchor itself should be dis@@ able .
simply take the settings of the screenshot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp on your computer exists )
&quot; number simultaneously read@@ more pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time only an existing drive ? Parall@@ el@@ es Read and Ko@@ tend ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore just try ourselves . &quot;
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to throwing the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are stored , then the path / folder is specified in which the W@@ AV files are stored . this folder is not mentioned if only there is a place on another drive . do not forget this folder if you want something to do with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; all this will enter as it is on the screenshot . the command is a bit long , under circumstances a little must be made to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &quot; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . the result reached com@@ pression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage . &quot;
&quot; note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the production of tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) . &quot;
put the rest as in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneous W@@ AV files : at a Du@@ al@@ Core or quad@@ rant or even a multi@@ processor machine can be attempted more than a W@@ AV file at the same time .
&quot; that is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for any reading a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the process of reading the &amp; CD is described on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is described on the hard disk . first , a connection to the Internet is described in the previous section . the process of which is described in this section , must be repeated for each out@@ going &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we have a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in free@@ DB , the screen@@ caps see a little different from those for a &amp; CD ; with successful from free@@ DB de@@ for@@ ested data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of taking it from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not yet done so now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the drive , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , such as in the screenshot . this only when the &amp; CD is identified ; as audio CD , can be read and can be read from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , then search in section questions and answers following the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was to be picked up by the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are already filled , and the name of the artist and the album are also shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can choose the database entry in your opinion best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the anchor for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialogue for settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but get the data from the internet you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen . the title of the piece in the first row of the input field &quot; News &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; . &quot;
the artist should no longer be entered into the input field &apos; Lat@@ est title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the different comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; warning : after the successful withdrawal of data from the free@@ DB the CD @-@ Editor is not empty , but it &apos;s always a good idea to check the content of the CD editors , so that you can &apos;t just start with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters begin or not ... ) but also to check whether there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags ; you have no maximum number of field settings ; this option is set up on the tab skin settings ; take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; . &quot;
you can change the tag of the generated files later on with the day editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers or file formats . see the Help for Ko@@ di@@ ers to obtain more information .
&quot; just choose an entry , which obviously corresponds with the style of the per@@ missible CD ; this is not important because we can &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . Pop or R@@ ap for example , are available under rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &quot; OK &quot; come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD Edit@@ ors appears again and you see that the boxes are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the actual piece . simply enter the title of the piece for any case and other information you want . &quot;
&quot; click the next line in the main window and process the same way until you have entered all the title dates of &amp; CD , entered . &quot;
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . please note that the artist and the album are shown on the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ sign before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are selected . simply make sure that all pieces are selected , or if you select the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; was started by clicking on the button selection out of the read process , this window will appear to confirm . OK , then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what exp@@ ires . &quot;
&quot; click on the rider &apos;s orders for turn on the order window . it is located in the left top half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window for controlling your orders . the first piece is just read onto the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
&quot; this error message can be seen when you &apos;re trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer , which you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red &apos;@@ X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dentally , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in example . have you checked whether you have access to the folder for temporary files and the target folders ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . so take out and code parallel . take note of the status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able is unclear is the number of parallel processes to read and code . with high @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . the calcul@@ ator used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and code ( but two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded . after the last piece is coded , a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create com@@ pressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the Ko@@ di@@ erer of your choice . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; today is maintained within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the cultiv@@ ator media package . but most distri@@ butions you have already included a pre @-@ compiled package that is part of an important &amp; k@@ iller ; if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to individuals who compile data files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program tailored to your needs if it is running once , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
a program that calls for many different other programs has many varieties of settings . at best you can read the step by step example to get the options and settings . it displays the screenshot of the different kart@@ ing cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used for example .
&quot; hello , still am reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first time launch of the program , without any un@@ cl@@ ue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program you don &apos;t have an audio CD ; in drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is about it ? who reads this is probably already started the program . it should look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t keep this manual . it is the first version for a manual too &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; if you read it . at least only after hearing from the author . and if you read this , he has agreed that section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if it has succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N to pick up , then you do not need this information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others it has with real @-@ time graf@@ ic and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ authenticity of texts also some features that may not have other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI @-@ Player .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system which should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support for the S &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ aso@@ und project driver that is needed for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it is a sequ@@ encer .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with altern@@ ating color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI @-@ channel by high@@ lighting the push buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can go into &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI @-@ file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; can be drawn onto K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( Li@@ asing events or text events ) . K@@ Mid automatically identi@@ fies the procedure used .
&quot; seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de , during the shooting of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select opening ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog , with whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid @-@ window . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a music piece , open it and get the button play@@ back in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play out of the menu piece or bet@@ tering the Le@@ ading . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you prefer it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will be added to a collection and then played in each other . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid , a piece set off , you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and drive along with the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the road@@ ster and so click the play@@ back speed . to get the original speed click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the emp@@ t@@ ant has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button appears as a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu piece , so breaks the play@@ ass@@ el while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play@@ back . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored on two types in a music piece . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set out what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically detected , so you don &apos;t have to adjust the entry to the entry Autom@@ atic text selection , but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set out an event type , select from the menu settings the entries of text events and song@@ events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can sum@@ mar@@ ise . this will be re@@ played in the series . in this section you can use collections effectively .
&quot; to start a collection , open first to the collecting ager . this can be found in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ izing .... Click New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then fill the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the sear@@ ched in collecting h@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; to the temporary collection there are all songs , which you want to add to none other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection will not be stored . concerns that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collecting bearings . there , you can add a song with the button to add a song , with whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting up automation .
&quot; when automation is activated for the collection , a piece of opening ( using File Open or D@@ rag &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic adding to the collection is not activated , in opening a piece it is activated and pun@@ ched . this collection will then be added to the continued pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection camp to select the collection and the desired song and then click on removal . &quot;
you can select the order in which the songs can be played . if you select the sequence down from the sub @-@ menu item collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or choose any order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it on collecting ager or use the drop list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song farther , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or push the button arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to switch a song back to the reverse , select the button previous piece , the entry predic@@ table piece of the menu piece or push the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collecting camp , select the delete collection and click on the button Clear . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely essential for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ map general @-@ MIDI events translated into events that understand the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always used a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need any MIDI map because all Sound@@ cards GM -@@ are compatible ( incl. A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM -@@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that saves all necessary con@@ versions for the play@@ back of a piece .
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section that may appear as often as desired . however , that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... END Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; name of the keyboard ... &quot; END Def@@ ine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... END THE END ... END
&quot; you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section is starting ( except for Options ) and AND , that the end of a section has reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support may be available for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard will be illustrated . the general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equation are ignored . it is believed that the GM -@@ patches are available in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to create all sounds that supports this instrument , with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can add a Drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( gun signal ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term con@@ drum patch of patch is meant that every sound is a different percus@@ sion@@ al instrument ( Drum , basin , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone also means the key height of the always identical drum , ( like him some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to provide such as notes on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can use multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to make notes on the Per@@ kus@@ sions channel . check out for example the provided key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to prevent some channels to others . if you want to switch for example the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the perc@@ ussion on a specific channel ( general MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section so has 16 lines , numbered between 0 and 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; N is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will need to be defined in the file . if you need the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case a patch is always used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ kus@@ sions patch on the per@@ end@@ sions channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Rati@@ o indicates , in which proportion Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der &apos;s events will be multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used , thus in the map file not dec@@ im@@ al com@@ mas . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM proposes that a Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der Event will win with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards to play two notes up to a oc@@ tave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find this in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the canal view is a window with a whole range of pi@@ vi@@ val ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ pel@@ vis you see which sounds are being played straight .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you can choose an instrument , lights are not green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played tones . view in the menu settings below the point channel view : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the speed , speed , &amp; etc . . thus , the same MIDI file lead to two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I cannot force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file is required ( a com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ary frame of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
this can happen if you have a Bin@@ ding distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have been compiled by &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s Home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; D@@ rag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , choose any files , and drag them onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; first , enable the settings to add automation to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can adjust the arrow key to the left from the tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slo@@ wing the reproduction . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD screen .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; working area a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; with window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ( if I don &apos;t want to play a bad@@ a@@ oke file ) or if I want to play a file or I want to split a file to the window and the window into the window by &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them equal to a collection , turn the setting up automation to the collection and the new ; file is added to temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; we participate , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting up automation to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then join also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear this songs , or the postcard see , anim@@ ate me further to &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in the second year , so I &apos;m not a lot of leisure time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files make music and prove things . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want to make a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make a great pleasure when you send me a postcard from your location or a MI@@ DI@@ O / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group , I will send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to send a MIDI @-@ file , but if you want to contact me , as I may already have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time , and nobody asked for it for money . I would therefore like to emphasize that I can only be programmed by users ( post@@ cards or emails ) . &quot;

&quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends greatly on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM @-@ device or a map@@ le card . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error directly to me . &quot;
&quot; the program is easy to use for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of files or PH@@ ON@@ ON formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet over as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The KDE website on new versions , or the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the window display is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optional , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a information window that will only then be displayed in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to send the preferred links below the menu reading sign , but these are some entries . if you want to create a list of entries related to each other , you should use the category of thum@@ b playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ies . if you sign up an entry , his group and all his sub @-@ groups are copied for the current category and the reproduction starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and durability play@@ lists can also be changed by direc@@ ting the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; km@@ . that &apos;s the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player . besides the application itself . simply clicking on a name of a category cli@@ que , that is shown in the menu only the XML content of this section is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to choose from the menu of the same with playlist , and select either the edit mode , or chosen another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or a different group , without using the playlist . &quot;
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player , some features can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
the animation during starting and Be@@ ans can be disabled by the E@@ di@@ os of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 the option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option does not exist , it can be inserted easily . &quot;
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; km@@ player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / share / apps / km@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during the start doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically ended by opening another source . this would be disturbing the end @-@ animation however , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
an easy example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite piece of pictures ; &amp; lt ; body@@ building.html ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g h@@ ur = &quot; in@@ lay &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ il@@ ds ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ il@@ ds ; They are in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; km@@ player ;
&quot; there is a rider to the configuration of M@@ player in the configur@@ ations dialog by &amp; km@@ player . here , the path can be set up from the M@@ player and the intermediate storage space of the data stream from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of km@@ . here is the output of m@@ player en@@ visi@@ bly .
there is no rider for this playlist in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c here is an example like an &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; km@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; with that of the &amp; km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; km@@ player ; module serves as service provider for the m@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the interior dialog file assignment of KDE . &quot;
&quot; the kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; km@@ player ; is in a consoles application to start and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output occurs within &amp; km@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; this is always used for a given back@@ end for a certain type of m@@ ime type ( of course only if this also has been determined ) , it must be done by manu@@ als of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ able files . for example , PH@@ ON@@ ON will display all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; can play TV maps , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the scanner can be used and the configur@@ ations file can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; the configuration of the V@@ DR ( video data records ) settings in the km@@ player is to use the dialog in the settings - &gt; source code &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , it should be detected from which one selected has to be found ( e.g. , it PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
since the V@@ DR support of km@@ player only can use X@@ Video ( probably this type of play@@ lists of video equipment under Linux is the only one working ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux enhancement for the X server function must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
&quot; internally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , these dv@@ d@@ nav@@ y , both source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play@@ back of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; are there references as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive , if I do not play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ? &quot;
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is run as user root after entering into the device . it is absolutely secure to ensure that / dev / CD@@ ROM indicates the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; X@@ ine only slowly starts , why does every time my CPU must be checked for its performance every time ? &quot;
note : the answer is obsolete . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value only the first time is x@@ ine to check the CPU .

&quot; Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for the creation of graphical user interface and network support , and is needed for comp@@ iling of &amp; k@@ ile . &quot;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional sc@@ ant application . under Unix @-@ artigen systems is probably accessed to the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; for installation should be highlighted the documentation of distribution and installation disc .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the c@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ iller ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual , however , all the proposals for documentation is taken into consideration . however , support for this project or documentation is desired , the contact form the c@@ ile should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or during the comp@@ iling of &amp; k@@ ile , or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed at the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ capabilities within a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; the possibility to complete , comp@@ iling and correction tools for these . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to find out more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities should be experienced , the hand@@ book to Kate is to be brought in . users of &amp; k@@ ile , can start working directly with the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate ; &quot;

&quot; just like other labels , &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction containing the most general properties such as paper format , side @-@ numbered and text box , with the command \ \ Program class , the body begins with the command \ \ Program { document } and must be closed using the command \ \ &apos; { document } . &quot;
&quot; the quick entry fee of &amp; k@@ ile , is a n@@ able feature for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; it provides some possibilities for the preparation of the document . it can also be made some of the document related settings . &quot;
&quot; document divisions : here@@ with , the type of document printed document ( article ) , book &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aps &#93; , project ( DIN ) &#91; C@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
code coding : hereby the character en@@ coding of the system will be used . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 -@@ key . if UT@@ F @-@ 8x should be included ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Docum@@ ents ) .
&quot; this list includes the mostly used additional packages for lat@@ ex ; for its integration , it includes only in the cross @-@ field . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document divisions of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always use the German text . &quot;
new users do not need to worry about . it is a brief description of the functions and further information on this topic in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the appropriate ) . through &amp; k@@ ile ; it is nonetheless noticed that some mathematical environment is not closed . however you will be noticed by the modest appearance of the output . however it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and damage . &quot;
with automatic de@@ pletion of the environments is generated when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ Program { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a blank ( for input the text ) and the per@@ tin@@ ent line to the envel@@ ope of the command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; { command } ) . this function can be activated in the men@@ Ã ¼ h@@ ile ; set ... La@@ TeX commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; ex@@ its the sub@@ division of the document into the following items ( part is the most common and sub@@ trac@@ ed element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the struc@@ turing , the single elements can be viewed and viewed by a mouse @-@ click on the respective module . &quot;
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; as soon as a DVI ; -@@ file &#91; ger@@ Ã ¤ n@@ Ã ³ file ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent File ) &#93; was created , jump &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contained a description of the format , and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the full output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view conversion and to print DVI ; files for different systems and words . &quot;
when using the lo@@ gs the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor was shor@@ tened and once on an element in the DVI ; -@@ file re@@ cli@@ cked is the exact opposite . once on a section in the lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code was cli@@ cked , becomes the corresponding position in the DVI ; -@@ viewer guide . &quot;
Master @-@ Document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document the work will be simplified with other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project can project project settings on project settings .
fast @-@ construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result automatically displayed ( if no error occurs in the source code ) .
file extraction : in this mode the DVI ; file on its co@@ der@@ less self @-@ growing and there is no call of &amp; oc@@ ular ; after the fast @-@ building .
&quot; when viewing the mach@@ ining devices , the three gro@@ w@@ down sel@@ ections indicate that the selection of common elements were developed in the document . the first selection range is for the fast incorpor@@ ation of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The pres@@ ent@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection other is for example , for articles such as Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , an image or different element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed term ( selection over a selection ) .
when using quote a selection list with liter@@ ary entries is displayed . for the mach@@ ining of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are corresponding editors necessary . the author offers good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files are also possible also in &amp; k@@ ile ; files can be written by hand .
&quot; the last drop @-@ field with the name is used for determining the font size . it can be set on the font , for the main text , the joints , etc. set . it is the following correspondence to apply : &quot;
&quot; when calling for &amp; k@@ ile , there are two options for disposal : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for the creation of a new document by selecting the document mode and restric@@ ting settings . 2 . this document can be written from the ground up with the hand . &quot;
&quot; the br@@ aces after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font . the font is not at the beginning , this may also happen in the text . &quot;
once the above source code example has to be compiled the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code will be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the men@@ Ã ¼ s B@@ auen or the button @-@ speed .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for the storage automatically automatically .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document error , should be sought in the log for the errors . when using fast @-@ building , it should be started . this is not the case , should also be considered the protocol . &quot;
&quot; a environment ( English environment ) is a text that will be treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the writing system should be created . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ &quot; { environment } &quot;
the rates are only stored inside the environment ( from \ \ Program { environment } to \ \ ) { environment } ) . there is no circum@@ ference ( number ) for the increase within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to bri@@ gh@@ ten the read@@ ability and usability of the document . it can be used for example certain fonts , fats , cur@@ si@@ ties , entertainment , etc . they may end either with the command \ \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course of course and is closed until he is closed with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Rate : created a quot@@ ation in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ { { ratio } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; sign @-@ signed , now a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; once in the assistant a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . therefore , a quote to see a few places in the Li@@ gh@@ - and cur@@ si@@ veness and a poem to the application to see the differences between these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , using editor view or Str@@ g E you can turn back to the editor ( with an external viewer ) the windows must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script file . simply try and spa@@ wn it . &quot;
DVI ; is a straight file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .@@ d@@ vi edition such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ converting or computer screen@@ play . &quot;
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the preparation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after the click on DVI - the document can be printed ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correct ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar is the conversion of the DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; file created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the transformation can be triggered by means of the pots in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
finding a direct jump from the editor to the appropriate position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ Ã ¤ r@@ ero . there must be only Modern under settings K@@ ile up ... Tools Gl@@ ue are full .
&quot; to be sear@@ ched for the fores@@ ters , the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor is positioned in a line of the source code and close to pad@@ lock . the jump to the corresponding location in the DVI ; -@@ viewer will take place . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; it has to set up &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; oc@@ ular ; as a text editor will set up ( settings of ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; should when using fast @-@ building of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewer doesn &apos;t need to be a bug , this should appear in the log file and in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file will tell the error source in the source code . in the editor you can refer to the line with errors in which the error appears . to drag the faul@@ ty line , in which the error appears to be cli@@ cked and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the appropriate button is cli@@ cked in the tool@@ bar , a window to choose from the template for the document appears to be used : &quot;
&quot; when selecting le@@ eres , a document can be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard to be used for quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; hands users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates , can be stored in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , needs to create a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; -@@ file paved or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template creation ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string ) . these variables can set up in settings and set up settings in settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced by : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ BA@@ ENT@@ AL OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into document class . typically they are used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ L@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of assist@@ ants and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way :
&quot; when creating a new document , then your own template will be filled instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template , should be sear@@ ched for one on the internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for reading and high@@ lighting from many different types of text@@ files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be carried out in men@@ Ã ¼ rich tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
&quot; to learn more than Kate ; and its possibilities to learn , the manual should be brought to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile are able to start working directly with the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate ; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference reference that can be called the men@@ Ã ¼ help La@@ TeX Reference reference . you might have a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
&quot; a double @-@ clicking with penet@@ rated Str@@ g button , to fix the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way clicking on \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par increases . &quot;
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with penet@@ rated left mouse , the full text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
when using the arrow buttons with penet@@ rated Shift can choose parts of the source code in the Edit@@ ing window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the various types of source codes and to elev@@ ate them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; - commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color . &quot;
many assist@@ ants can be found on their own type of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ Ã ¤ ge pot is highlighted inside the text . also this spr@@ ing@@ shot is highlighted that in the first input of a sign is automatically saved .
&quot; mach@@ ining is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile . although &amp; Kate ; already great possibilities for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands available for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . among mach@@ ining matches , the following commands are included in the text selection : &quot;
&quot; if a paragraph includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines connecting on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only bow thing is divided into &amp; k@@ ile . the only bow is separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; note the word under the current c@@ urs@@ or@@ position . this selection has also an advanced significance , as this command also has lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a red circle line ( \ \ ) and a real star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for lunch of a part of the document it can be removed from this first . &amp; Kate ; offers the key@@ hole C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line will be removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own command , for a faster activity . under mach@@ ining removal are the following commands to be included : &quot;
remo@@ ves a whole paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile is included in the description of mach@@ ining excer@@ pts .
it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for more orders under mach@@ ining environment for a better work with &amp; lat@@ ex ;
with this command the current environment is bl@@ amed ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly before the command to the nearby area .
with this command to boun@@ ce the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to the bu@@ ckets of the surroundings .
when the c@@ ursor from or inside the command \ \ begin { surroundings } is located to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering from many sp@@ elling , ambient command@@ ing can quickly go over to the crossing . this command increases the most recently in@@ conclusi@@ ve environment so that the sp@@ elling environment @-@ structure will not be dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Groups that are determined by cl@@ as@@ ps { ... } . under mach@@ ining TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from mach@@ ining environment .
with this command the start of the current group is bl@@ amed ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly before the curved cl@@ amps .
with this command to the end of the current group boun@@ ces ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amps .
&quot; if the c@@ ursor is before or behind the soft cl@@ amp of a p@@ tex ; group # located , is stri@@ pping to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; with the entry of many spar@@ ed groups @-@ brack@@ ets could quickly go over the over @-@ back view . this command slept with the last recorded group , so that the spi@@ kes structure of &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not allowed . &quot;
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; are used two simple instructions for use in &amp; k@@ ile ; for the purpose of purpose is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &apos; for two simple signs of the sign is used .
this automatic addition of the double altern@@ ation characters can set up under settings K@@ ile up ... La@@ TeX and will be dischar@@ ged .
you can also be lactose @-@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and therefore it can be used as many other languages .
&quot; at the wir@@ ing of Shift ; input holes , &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent Zei@@ len@@ eck . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , including the command \ \ item . &quot;
inside a tables -@@ surroundings un@@ covered &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ associated with a close ch@@ len@@ um@@ ance .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ placed &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to support . this can be added to settings in La@@ TeX .
&quot; some users want to connect the columns in tables -@@ environments , and thereby all the E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) ; searches &amp; k@@ ile ; for the n@@ em@@ ous tab@@ ulator in the next row . although this tab is not the per@@ tin@@ ent lines , for the columns of the current tab@@ ulated . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate is already in a good source code . it has been developed in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three according to demand and the other two are available for automatic rein@@ st@@ aging . all these mo@@ di can set up different ways of working under settings . &quot;
start a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ &apos; { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; while pressing the R@@ Ã ¼ ck taste is removed , the last character of the entry is removed and this is the compar@@ ative list . on the other hand , the list is by entering another letter also . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameter . alternatively , the descriptions are covered by a command of a command . alternatively , the chart can be repaired , so that a simple jump to these positions by means of mach@@ ining jump @-@ brand new and the seas@@ oned parameters can then be changed . &quot;
&quot; under settings k@@ ile , set up ... k@@ ile ; compar@@ ing settings can be made to these lists . you can choose different wine lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as guar@@ dians of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; the command Mode is available for re @-@ use of environments , and the call for full resolution mode will have to be entered into a rough list of environments . on the other hand , the environments will be used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the actu@@ ation mode for the complete environment or the keyboard Alt + Shift key + Shift key ) , the command can be automatically inserted and it appears \ \ Program . after that , the ambient light can be applied to the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the entry is added . &quot;
&quot; once this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile , realize that it is a lists environment , is even a first \ \ item command covered with . &quot;
&quot; under settings k@@ ile , set up ... k@@ ile ; compar@@ ing settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the em@@ body list of actu@@ ating mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; powered user @-@ defined lists of layers replaced immediately by lung strings . the lists can be set up under settings K@@ ile . as an example of a check list is included the file exam@@ ple@@ .c@@ wl where for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX .
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word trans@@ verse in order to cur@@ b the frag@@ ments of dec@@ eived de@@ duc@@ ting or the ke@@ yp@@ ass@@ ing string , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; rough w@@ edges are not helpful , however , that many women are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the en@@ closure of all already written wine . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set in the men@@ Ã ¼ n@@ ile settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ sing Str@@ e . here , the swelling can also be defined for the display of completion . &quot;
&quot; the actu@@ ation files can be installed in the sub @-@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Persian Home @-@ folder . mode stands for &quot; &quot; ation &quot; , &quot; Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ h@@ ops ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog between graphics and graphics are designed as simple as possible . for the view of the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be subject to sections . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF -@@ files , but offer an excellent basis for visiting and re@@ arrangement of pages . the PDF -@@ output may be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools are re@@ arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to be able to check the results of the work , you have to compile the source code . all components are group@@ ed into the menu of creating compact , creating converting and creating view . &quot;
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewers like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other transformation can be used by Alt ; 3 . afterwards the DVI ; file into a PS file can be converted by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file to be treated in a PS file and by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file .
&quot; when using the command @-@ building , normally a viewer is called after the comp@@ iling . should not be used in a built @-@ in viewer , every new window will be called a new window . &quot;
a new project will be asked for the project New Project .... here is the following information for the project :
&quot; when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r -@@ project file . &quot;
&quot; the script function of &amp; k@@ ile , allows for adding EC@@ M@@ AS@@ cript -@@ Ko@@ en . the scripts can be managed in the sen@@ k@@ right body . &quot;
the API @-@ scripts have not yet been developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
first you have to be said that the expansion of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = c@@ ile ) with the following methods have :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly sophisticated system that can be extended by a variety of available packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help for supporting the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents and contain a documentation for the contained packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; a fully trans@@ forming Ref@@ ern@@ ut for &amp; tex ; and its e@@ â pro@@ ud@@ ge@@ ant is described by the B@@ lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for finding a certain form@@ atting . since it is a very rough document , it is divided into a very rough document ; it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; Tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; extr@@ ad@@ ited , the finding of the correct document is not always simple . as a great help offer &amp; tet@@ ex ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which includes a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and covered by a graphical area . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories and the common advantage is the search for par@@ cel name or stroke . by &amp; k@@ ile , then only the results are shown . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the operator of the Le@@ ading means the viewer for the document .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source code editor used on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ iller ; is also part of the Fink project which can be filmed &amp; k@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .
&quot; much thanks to those who continue after the progress of the &amp; k@@ ile ; project are aiming for a number of hours for the development of tools offered , which we can use all in compliance with the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains a lot of new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in its integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools apply comb@@ us@@ als and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has worked , argu@@ ing pro@@ c and how over@@ rag@@ ing it is . lift it a piece , we give it a graphic interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the symbol for the XML @-@ processor and finish ! &quot;
&quot; this application is expected to be an index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the contrary desktop . if not , then remove the current working folder and enter the required folder in the field of other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted each time when mein@@ pro@@ c will start .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical interface for that . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then they just let the current work folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is available . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to a output on screen , its file is faul@@ ty . please check the errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file @-@ tested file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then they let the current file be easy . if not , delete the file with the current file and select the file @-@ defined file by using other file - file sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , then click the Well @-@ being re@@ viewing selection . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; indicated in the &amp; XML ; file specified , they select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection . both for the C@@ 3C , file selection , and the specification of the Defini@@ tional UR@@ I , is required in the file selection . &quot;
Ja@@ az@@ er , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the comp@@ ut@@ ant file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus was already marked , then they let the current file be selected . if not , remove the selection of the current file and select the file required by using the other file select file . &quot;
type the file name as the result is to be named . the file is usually saved in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , die &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even if the plugin system is very powerful . you can benefit from the added functionality and must not wait until someone can build the lo@@ oting in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI . more information can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start with the menu plug @-@ ins processing . thus the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; this dialog allows to manage and add new plug @-@ ins and add new ads . we describe each &amp; GUI , element in it : &quot;
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage place &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ ins .
often working on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the listing of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
the name and e @-@ mail entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project as well as both team@@ leader and sub@@ project leader .
the user can choose from the list of members of members who he is . this happens when he looks the team member from the list and pressing the button as oppressed . the currently selected member ( its identi@@ fier ) appears after you are : text .
&quot; the nickname and setting of your own identity are important to news and notes , see for further information on notes . &quot;
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team : there is an event designed to provide information to the team leader , if something specific is happening . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that happen if something particular takes place in the project . an example would be recording of opening and closing the project , such that a file will be saved , or the sending a message when a file will be saved , or a script that will be added to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings . , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
a mail will be sent to the addres@@ see in the addres@@ see list selected addres@@ see . the addres@@ see can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project manager . see in which wei is the lad@@ der .
comments are special comments in the documents . you differ from normal comments by following things :
notes to enter is simple . it can be selected either the note entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by text text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the Nickname @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , whereas the nickname of the registered nickname of Team@@ leaders should be introduced to the respective departments - or Sub@@ project leader , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and re@@ els names are independent of large or small @-@ write , but blank spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : do the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : is a development environment for scripts and form@@ ative languages , the DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic is also supported and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; settings are available through the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta ... to be called . diesel @-@ dialog covers a number of pages , which will be dealt with each other . &quot;
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
&quot; large / small @-@ off of tags : large / small @-@ write tags are automatically covered , the tags are inserted as inserted as they are described in the days of day XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / small @-@ write of attributes : large / small @-@ write of automatically , respectively , the attributes are inserted as inserted , the attributes are inserted as inserted in the days of day XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags are automatically closing : if hal@@ ted , will be optional for tags for which the final day is optional , this immediately after that . &quot;
&quot; non @-@ optional tags are automatically closing : as above all other tags , except for the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; starting and end @-@ day automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the appropriate code en@@ coding during the inser@@ tion .
&quot; M@@ IME types : Mim@@ eti@@ ze for detection of different types of files . using the default standard , the standard input can be recovered . &quot;
standard Dra@@ en@@ coding : the coding of newly created or in other ways than using file opening files ( where the coding of the file may be over@@ thrown ) . this setting is shown from the same into the projection characteristics if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D have not been recognized . however , this setting is shown here from the same into the project Properties , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; made regular backup copies , so if in a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document is restored from this backup . it is not the same as saving the file . also for not stored documents a backup is regularly created . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or one &apos;s view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to see the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
put the window settings on the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface through changing the M@@ DI @-@ modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line .
the warning @-@ backs section serves the control of the possibility to dis@@ able the display of war@@ nings carried out by checking out of no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in its shared mode .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the struc@@ turing @-@ tree , which represents the representation of the par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be set into details . &quot;
&quot; in the area mouse @-@ click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the struc@@ turing . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be automatically opened , the actu@@ ality of the tree when mach@@ ining and how deep in a change of struc@@ tions are automatically opened , while empty groups are such that in the current document no element has been found . &quot;
&quot; the area to fix abbrevi@@ ations ( some kind of templates ) are divided into groups , each can be divided into groups , each can be divided for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it means that it can enter a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ id abbrevi@@ ation is different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plugins can be managed . plugins are K@@ Part @-@ Applications from the third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part application , on the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be specified : &quot;
&quot; address : the path to the plug @-@ in , if it is not located on a standard as $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib . &quot;
&quot; input : this information will be passed to the plugin &apos;s plugin , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in the &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuse the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : is this activ@@ ating , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the single @-@ set information is correct , even if the plug @-@ in is not available , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the de@@ bug@@ ging was completely re @-@ developed . Di@@ e@@ Support for the non @-@ built @-@ built @-@ in function , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin was implemented , which enables different implem@@ entations of plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the options options besides the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plugin sel@@ ections can change the specific settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of surveillance variables is displayed . usually appear in the left dock .
&quot; a view , in which all brack@@ ets are listed , with line numbers and conditions are usually listed in the lower dock . &quot;
&quot; a view , shown in which the output ( like in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown , normally in the lower dock . &quot;
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , on debit claims . this action is opened by default when a project is opened , which doesn &apos;t need to be respected in a de@@ bu@@ gger so that it does not need to be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . includes the link to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the foli@@ age to requirements .
sends a HTTP @-@ request to request a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to watch the current document . the output of this requirement is shown in the view de@@ bu@@ gger output .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script and information about monitoring variables , as well as the currently executed line . when this happens , the execution started . it happens before a debit card started , the script starts with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script , without information on monitoring variables and the current line number . when this happens , while a script is added , the execution begins , as soon as a request is made . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger is conducting the next directive in the script without entering into the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger is conducting the next directive in the script whereby if possible in functions and includes will be carried out .
de@@ bu@@ gger the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the statement and go to the next so as if there were the current one .
&quot; opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression is entered , the monitoring is to be monitored . the monitoring value appears in the variable view . &quot;
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keit@@ h Is@@ dale like this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a K@@ part of x@@ sl@@ db@@ g which they can be found at http : / / x@@ sl@@ db@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keit@@ h .
&quot; this chapter describes how you can custom@@ ise &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can adapt to your needs and how you can make qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , better . &quot;
&quot; document type E@@ di@@ tier@@ pack@@ ete ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for mark@@ ers and scrip@@ ting languages , as well as CSS . you enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; skills such as car completion and chains ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bar . day folder includes two types , the tag and the tool@@ bar . tag forms are handy , symbolic @-@ oriented Lei@@ sten of images ( above the E@@ di@@ tier window ) , the text and instructions faster in a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bar . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property di@@ alog@@ y ; for the day shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even the tool@@ bar permit a fast filing of tags in a document without a risk of error . &quot;
&quot; tag folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day @-@ folder carry the name of descri@@ p@@ tive language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ sent ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations will be presented in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a meeting document . it can occur only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it does not mean anything but element type above itself . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument in function . ( only family 2 )
only for the type class is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type meth@@ od valid . indicates the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute , and the attributes within these tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into dialogue . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ tag . this is a only element type element .
&quot; describes a attribute of a tags . this item can only exist once for any attribute . in addition , there are other tags you describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element @-@ element . &quot;
returns the source materials used for the attributes in the tag Edit@@ or@@ dialog and in the attribute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a chi@@ pping - and a methodology . the arguments that are handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a tank @-@ day that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can occur for one attribute only once . it is a generic type element .
put the position of the but@@ e@@ ability of a tags within a dialogue . this day can occur only once for each attribute ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; day ) . the element is empty .
is the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present every field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
gives a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is an only element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all our @-@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ aling code : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
&quot; space do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replace it will not effect any leg , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the &quot; &quot; XML files &quot; &quot; the tools is to start dialogue at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ K . another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . at present , the check is only available when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following , an example of a functioning family 2 day @-@ XML file . in this file a fil@@ en@@ ame file will be described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; / &gt; &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file is just as simple and there is an editor for it to be edited by DT@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite DT@@ D settings . this can be processed di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nickname = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not indicated , the name is used as nickname . &quot;
an action can set up actions with settings ... click New action leads to the same dialog :
the key@@ boards of this action can be assigned by clicking on the button &apos; button . with the button &apos; button &apos; button to be assigned a key@@ boards ; with K@@ one is the current short@@ cut .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when running the action this text is inserted in the document at the current c@@ ursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can change external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick@@ start -@@ dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter may be indicated . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although skilled paths are allowed to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the current document in case of a local document .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running is the text unique on the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the external script is used .
&quot; the parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
in addition to the above listed methods a script can form a f@@ antasi@@ es of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at the standard input data . in the selection entry you can be determined to send to the default ones . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only recommended with this setting .
&quot; accordingly the input can also be re@@ directed to the output of the application . there are two kinds of output : normal output , written on the standard version . it can be specified regarding the default output current text by which the value of the selection issue is set to : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select Settings promotions . &quot;
the parts of this window are fairly self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and , in case the day attributes , and you plan their use , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; if available to allow a input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ currently ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics More programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; use by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose modified size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon does not only helps you remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create an Start@@ kno@@ b as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually considered as los , rigi@@ d , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled ; starting to insert this symbol ; - day in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol , it must be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text box there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the apply button and continue with other tags , so there are still ones , or confirm with OK to finish . &quot;
suppose you want to supplement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ capabilities to the tool@@ bar or it should be used for better overview of several tracks into several groups . make sure you set up the tool@@ bar settings . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; I want to choose the separ@@ ators ( very left top ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to review a quick way to access the kon@@ quer@@ or review . I will be able to select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who knows my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by making all symbols tested , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; if new XML does not exist , it will be im@@ regular folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please match her &amp; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so on that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be charged ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ ative language , which you like most . therefore , describes this chapter as I make a &amp; PHP ; documentation for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory , whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ ative / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then you have to leave the second part here . &quot;
&quot; # KDE configur@@ ations file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc You = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example , .@@ ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2@@ .html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2@@ .html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93; contents 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , 2 = special 2@@ .html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2@@ .html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2@@ .html day 3 = tag@@ 3@@ .html &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something :
&quot; # KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc You = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = index.html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = In@@ tro@@ duction , ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ Tax@@ .html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . that indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess squ@@ ad ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ent at the top of the Bau@@ man@@ tle &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
&quot; space do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources can be replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is to be displayed on the design of the context @-@ context @-@ sensitive help . by mark@@ ings of a function and pressing _ fetch _ array , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context @-@ text file ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file @-@ line @-@ lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of modules @-@ separated context @-@ elements which are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( so as you indicated this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and it &apos;s worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the le@@ ash resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ boxes with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else to anyone . at different places there is an email of menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package with email send , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ses , users can download it . the contributions are checked and only available when our team needs them as accurate and useless for publication . to make a beneficial contribution to what it provides a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have several key , you may need to stay out . in the dialogue New resource you will have to stay empty ) and then click OK the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can upload from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still prior to installation , exam@@ ining &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the invali@@ dity of the resource by exam@@ ining the integrity and of the signature . in the case of problems warning it and it can then be cancelled . please note the warning messages and the resource displayed correctly , a message appears with the specification of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , it is possible to work by adding a D@@ TE@@ P package . it provides the simple way , a DT@@ D automatically convert into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the menu DT@@ D Download and Conver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . afterwards the following dialogue will appear :
target directories : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name to the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition page : the string chain that is published in the ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day like HTML Public - / / W@@ 3C / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d to appear
&quot; fin@@ eness of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and make full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . therefore , this chapter tries to bring them precisely these concepts , without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ y ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : stored , available . by tool@@ bar about actions is all that is considered globally , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this enables the group of administr@@ ators different tool@@ bar , actions and patterns in the global tree , which can then be available to each in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bar . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ designs up to tool@@ bar with special actions specifically for the files of a certain project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are placed in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ ishes the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the buil@@ ders , the cart@@ els with info and the tool@@ bar . please hit , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the cart@@ ons with the right mouse button to create a context menu with the current Docum@@ et pass@@ codes , as well as close the current , other or all boxes , re @-@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the Edit@@ ors range , lead to another context menu regarding the editing steps ( cutting / paste ) , editing the word under the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor or opening the file , when the string is described below the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editors are the tool@@ bar of Edit@@ ors . currently stands &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bar is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; are adapted to the tool@@ bar to the new functions and thereby the associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , for example , click on the icon which represents the day . now , you can insert the data for this straight one day . if you want to insert the data for this one day ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialogue with different fields . &quot;
&quot; the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate to open and ro@@ am . in the display with cardboard boxes stand for files , project , sample templates , documents , scripts , attributes , attributes , and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that poses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view displays all the files in the project and allows the pamper@@ ing of files in the project by right mouse @-@ click . actions such as Add , removal , up@@ loading or delet@@ ing the files from the storage media using the then indicated context menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program components , a whole website &amp; etc ; there are all options open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what regard they are used . the category depends on the corresponding users and templates in projects are available only for the respective users and templates in projects are available only in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the right mouse button , you can also check the available information on a script via the right mouse button , as for example the script to start , edit or send it by mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ clicking of an element , the c@@ ursor in the document is placed on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking a element opens a list of commands regarding navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
this tree seems to be among other buildings . with him you can change some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . this allows for the content of the key@@ ing system to change all available attributes with a few clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation to find the web technology for your development . there can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; you can create documentation site , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited , edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : two boxes at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the beneficial information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this cart@@ on display information on each in Qu@@ anta &apos;s ongoing script . so , for instance , the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this card fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner presents all errors in the market @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , giving any error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar is extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command indicated . the chocolate @-@ page of the tool@@ bar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; a further function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as com@@ pressing T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ y ; like any other secure and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable , if you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if you want to adapt a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to find a complete list of options available to the configure script . the options are easy to understand and here not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check whether your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web @-@ development tool for the KDE @-@ surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus was optimized for a quick Web @-@ development , combined with a proven development environment with a multitude of powerful functions . &quot;
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a seam@@ less idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus was ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web @-@ development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer than one &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now summ@@ arized far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should be a suitable for IDE ; for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim needs to be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus was established ; as a product based on the outstanding effort of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community , there is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so as to expand , as they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web@@ developers to increase the use of intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . through the program , they can have to remember it &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . ( more about it can be found in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta , plus ; is a web@@ design environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and was quickly expanded to an mature editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta . the original developers sent the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the details , with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL into &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta run ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta , is being developed and super@@ vised by Eric Laf@@ fo@@ one sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not located , whereby the oldest listing is taken . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . should they try to store the selected file / text outside of the local / Project @-@ stock folder , only an error is reported . &quot;
conver@@ ts to the inser@@ ting of the cli@@ p@@ board there enthal@@ on special characters to the &amp; HTML ; -@@ insur@@ er so that they are displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as a form@@ ative instruction .
&quot; convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ ham , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor @-@ day . &quot;
&quot; switched the block from or off . that allows you to select text blocks , by means of &amp; Shift ; taste . &quot;
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
&quot; searches a string or regular expression in selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions , to help you . &quot;
shows the message window to or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .

shows the tool@@ bar left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a single mouse click .
&quot; if book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the c@@ urs@@ ors in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other surv@@ ey@@ ed documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with file . web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables to copy graphic files into your project folder , or a sub@@ folder , and then add it to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; starting and whether you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in Chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are explained by the details . &quot;
&quot; loads of the tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu , if you have assigned it to this project . &quot;
&quot; a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project . &quot;
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions need to be stored by means of settings . digit@@ alization boxes are stored via tool@@ boxes or you are asked when you want to store the tool@@ bar .
&quot; remo@@ ves a tool@@ bar from the lens . it does not delete them from the disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you like to do this . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : -@@ team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar . &quot;
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bar to the main server where any other can access it . see in .
invite one &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own descri@@ b@@ able format .
&quot; loading / re@@ fresh the En@@ ti@@ sts out of the &amp; DT@@ D ; . is useful when the En@@ ti@@ sts out of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; are to be refres@@ hed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a writing to the global KDE folder is not present , the shop is failing . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags , which are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard is loaded in the tags menu a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day setup dialog , when there is one . this entry is available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menu . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates and de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus was denied boarding , if this day res@@ ist the rules in this place . &quot;
in the plug @-@ in menu the available plugins are listed below the menu @-@ mentioned menu points . click activated . click on one of the activated plugins .
select the syn@@ dic@@ ation mode for the current file . the list of available Her@@ r@@ ator schem@@ ata depends on the version .
&quot; choose the type of kno@@ ck identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people , use other OS platforms to extract . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of the user interface . due to some restrictions to the KDE libraries , the switching times can sometimes need or un@@ nice graphics . recommended , the default card mode , which is also default , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selection of a entries the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
folding the status of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog will be affected every application , using the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browsers . &quot;
judge the behavior of the editors . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or which can change and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should generate an aid in accordance with the environment of the mouse c@@ ursor , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with every open source project developers can help you get help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out from top to bottom , as for example , after filling the project , the whole directory @-@ structure will automatically be completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later on Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example foo . when entering its name , file will be automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; standard file . by default it has the name of the project in small case letters and without blank spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server @-@ address of the machine that you want to access , one , apart from being processed local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ ar ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if this field is empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol shall be used . depending on the setting of the remote host could be an adaptation needed . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates for the project is stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set rather than standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , where the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set rather than standard . &quot;
&quot; this allows to include files from the local fil@@ es@@ ystem to the project . multiple files , or whole folder can be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . at ser@@ vers@@ ed script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; intake , if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be involved . if a project is emerging from scratch , not an@@ h@@ aken . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of re@@ thin . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by an@@ h@@ acks or , by removing the ha@@ sten@@ ing , cl@@ ing out of the project . &quot;
the latest screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with project features in the Men@@ swe@@ eping window or using the key@@ boards Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ame ( plac@@ enta is possible ) which can be found in project @-@ related operations like the project folder .
&quot; suppl@@ ementary option to the top , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view that is loaded when opening the project . in case more about project views can be read .
this can be selected the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the Debug@@ ger plug @-@ in can be set with the button options . in this case the de@@ bug tool can be described .
&quot; in the sub@@ window profile , high @-@ speed profiles can be adjusted ( see in ) as well as the display of a tree @-@ view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing out a separate building view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration you can switch event actions and add these actions , change or delete . event actions are executed when a previous event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced by default . &quot;
to open a different project you can open yourself ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus was closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files happens . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
project management gives free access to the files in the project . there the files in the current project can be managed .
&quot; folder vary as well , but the entries are open and open with ... in the right @-@ click context menu : &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the location of the highly recommended files . &quot;
&quot; enables the removal of the current profile . if only more a profile is present , the button is termin@@ ated to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password is kept in the core memory and will keep in mind . this option is useful when most common up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password cannot be saved on the record -@@ option .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion in front of the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ speed profiles can be compiled and so that the project ( or parts of the project ) will be up@@ loaded to different servers . when processing or creating a profile , this dialog is shown : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server to be copied to the files , either a fully qualified domain name or IP address . &quot;
&quot; the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed k@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
&quot; depending on your att@@ acking shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it to your discretion . the password is saved on the record , but everyone with programming can be easily seen in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simply exchange the view can be loaded different files and tool@@ bar and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; can be stored in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings of tool@@ bar @-@ tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ses , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own way of working . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bar in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best arranged on the menu tool@@ bar . use and execution will differ from the addition of the tool@@ bar below .
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols on this can be set out either via context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the tool@@ bar can be used to establish a new tool@@ bar , which can be specified in dialogue where actions on this or other tool@@ bar can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additionally the entries are removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool tool@@ bar and set up settings .
&quot; templates are basically in essential document chain , code @-@ car@@ el and files to the short@@ cut . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used basically as a common file system with advanced organisation and interfaces . you can copy , move or each on the system available existing directory in the pre @-@ storage tree ; in about the limitations you imagine for the fil@@ es@@ ystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates are conditions for their use . please read the conditions submitted at the start of each template before usage .
&quot; binary is all that is not pur@@ er text is . it can be inserted any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . bin@@ aries are usually inserted in documents using tu@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in pre @-@ storage box under global templates . further information about the templates tree is available . &quot;
documents can be created by any text document type . based on these templates are new documents created . normally a simple ru@@ mor for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ storage area among global templates . see for more information about templates .
this kind of templates is useful when not a new document is designed based on a template but the same text area is always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a complete mark on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . some examples are available in the pre @-@ storage room under global templates . see for more information about templates .
&quot; as the name says , these templates for whole web sites serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a com@@ pressed tar archive . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure to Beli@@ eving ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select file As a template save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; once that happen , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree ; take a look at the pre @-@ storage area under project templates . &quot;
select text in your document and click on a file As a template to save the selection as local / proj@@ ector . alternatively the selection may be de@@ duc@@ ted with drag@@ ging and eff@@ ected on the assem@@ bling templates .
&quot; the production of binary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a pre @-@ storage folder . all the file management functions can be used for , such as pul@@ ling and deriv@@ atives , or inser@@ ting the file tree of kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can select in the file tree or in the project files construction view on a folder right and secure site template , backed by default in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates will allow a very target @-@ oriented procedure . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er , or dynam@@ ically with the PHP ; design , file , or connect with them . additionally you can keep some things while using templates in projects very profound . &quot;
the pre @-@ storage structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / US and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / eng files . each of these folder corresponds to one of four types of container as explained above .
&quot; to set the behaviour of a folder , click the folder overview with right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu characteristics . the following dialogue will appear : &quot;
&quot; a selection with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is devi@@ ded , as soon as an elli@@ gible attribute is raised . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fit for everything except the regular channels in the pre @-@ storage area . if a regular folder would be set aside , unless they would be explicitly activated . in the case of a normal folder , the bl@@ az@@ em would appear with something like text files . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular blo@@ wer . &quot;
allowed to set out or set up text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er to match the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ er .
&quot; in addition , you can use context menu ( indicating right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste from templates by one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor used through the menu View . the first mode replaces the source pane in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ site and a c@@ ursor . then you can edit and dis@@ able if necessary changes in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor in source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with V@@ PL ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . there is no plans to change this behavior .
&quot; the second mode works exactly as the first , except that at the same time the changes in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor can be activated and the c@@ ursor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor synchron@@ ously is activated , the key@@ press puts the active c@@ ursor from a window to the other , with which the position in the document will be retained . &quot;
the sync distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the Source text editor is adjustable to settings according to settings . after selecting V@@ PL ; view it can be selected between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation is : a small gap for fast computers and a big gap for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the processing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor can also be accessed as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will also be created . this is the reduction of hanging cro@@ codi@@ les . thus , it is possible to change the following : &quot;
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself for example keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click in the list offers the change of content , e.g. key words on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word on the content . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template , using the file @-@ open button and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , due to loading with the arrows . under rare circumstances the c@@ ursor acts as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing , using re@@ taste or remo@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is carried out in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor , it is to note that the inser@@ tion of tags previously identi@@ fies existing identical tags , e.g. if an anchor @-@ day , surround with text , every other surrounding anchor has to be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bar such as the tables wiz@@ ard or the lists assistant are disabled . they will be later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release the tables or lists of tool@@ bar must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style styles . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for specific elements is possible and the execution of the style of style can be prosec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; to be able to compile , need to compile , other than &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ pped and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already available in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
&quot; the performance was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had done many changes and at the same time suffered a lot of places in the same file . a further programmer had changed a lot in the same file . the result were many conflicts in bringing together . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there were no indications of the places where maybe only the reg@@ im@@ ation had changed . that &apos;s the result of these changes was a little night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white signs . later , a lot more useful features have been added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you would like to compare text , just copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and add it to one of the compar@@ isons windows . &quot;
a function which made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ fl@@ edged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way combined will be fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently from one piece of co@@ ders and show changes . the original file ( the base ) helps rech@@ ar@@ ming the exact change . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screenshot displays three Qu@@ ell files in the following :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the compar@@ isons and merge complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the folder :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences , and reflect on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monit@@ ors . if you need to verify mal@@ functions , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences between white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible clearly . if lines are visible only in a certain number of white characters , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no anger more if J@@ em@@ and the envel@@ ope changes . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal and the other is different in one line , then the colour indicates that which file is different . red colour means that both files are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files are the same name , but in different folders , you can facilitate the typ@@ ing work by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ use folder , folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder @-@ 1 folder , folder , folder , folder , 1 folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , 1 folder , folder 3 folder , folder 3 ( folder ) folder 3 folder &quot;
&quot; open dialogue enables the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ame , selecting from the file list ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the pop@@ up list . you don &apos;t have to specify the third file in the next time . you don &apos;t have to specify the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be implemented . &quot;
&quot; with the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons will be selected , for B and C but a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if together , the input field is active , the input field is active and can be dealt with . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately set out a output file . you can also get this step later when saving . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the compar@@ isons .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to choose text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . in the Open Dialog you need to select no files , you can simply connect the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; you can also use drag and deriv@@ atives : just drag a file from a file manager or select text from one editor , and let it drop it over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; which idea is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how much these functions are , it would require a relatively high effort . you &apos;d just download two such files , they are in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; load and then compare them . now you can easily paste the relevant sections to paste and then compare . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , you can not drag anything out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the fall of text in a compar@@ ing window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors may interpret the pul@@ ling and deri@@ ve from text into another program as a cut and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info page contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while over the line . then a small help window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source @-@ windows are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one sees the color that file differs . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) good to see . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the compositions column . if differences have been found , the column shows the corresponding color . at some programming where white characters is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) B. White characters only are relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; vertical line , which separates the summ@@ arize column from the text , is interrupted by the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the index changes is activated , the line will be shown at surrounding lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the compar@@ ing windows ) has also a info line with the publication edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changed &#93; if you have dealt with the result . usually it contains by the automatic merge already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! up to all conflicts are dis@@ solved , the save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the stem resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ ing patterns are used , each difference must also be solved simultaneously a conflict of manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button on the compositions column in one of the windows , the first line of the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will not appear . ) This group becomes the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , through the automatic fe@@ eder or by manual editing no further line stays in the group ; then this is only a space for the event that you change your mind and maybe to choose another source . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a mark@@ er you might want to copy and wo@@ unded elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; cons@@ ented ; however , in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go cau@@ tious with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the options to ignore the options , ignore or ign@@ oring C / C + + Comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly using the images and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you use in one of the windows , you can use the arrow buttons , right , end , string and Str@@ g end , see how you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the eye window you can also use the other buttons to manipul@@ ate . with the inser@@ ting button you can switch between installation and over@@ writing mode . ( pre @-@ set is the entry mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button into one of the se@@ aling columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the start of each group ( as already in the section shown and the edi@@ ble output pattern was explained ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump into the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflicts ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflicts . therefore , between sol@@ dered and uns@@ ol@@ ved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g inser@@ tion ) . if this option is automatically covered , automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board and paste the manual copying . be careful with this option but you could not write so the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; data files are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a po@@ inter @-@ code characters \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use Wag@@ en@@ sers to + Zei@@ len@@ vor@@ schu@@ b \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 reserves the line of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of last used files is automatically stored and restored during the next starting . ( menu Sett@@ ings@@ - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on a few systems the dialog also displays vari@@ able width for selection , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are shown in cur@@ ative writing . if the characters selected this presentation does not support , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colours , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be illustrated . on these systems the button will automatically make an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the pressing button is inserted by the Tab@@ ulator button . otherwise a tab@@ ulator is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you express input or return , the registration of the aforementioned line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board falls off . &quot;
you can select which hands @-@ type you prefer to save . the pre @-@ set value is the generally usual choices on the operating system .
&quot; in the compar@@ isons of files try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines to be found in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . this step will not be ignored . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . even when playing white characters will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; and a line mount &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored and k@@ diff@@ use , but then they might be activated with different dimensions in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , but then they might be activated with different dimensions in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , but then they might be disabled . during this option these options must be disabled . in the default , this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , figures and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the outcome , the differences are still shown , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences go . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very big files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ atic @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is shown before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ sol@@ ves automatically all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . if you need this only from time to time , then use the Autom@@ atic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments when the options must ignore or ign@@ oring C / C + + -@@ comments . &quot;
these options are dealt with in the chapter on the scanning of folders and perform a compilation . look for details under documentation for the directory comparison and performance .
&quot; when a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g file . if already there is such a back@@ up@@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g file , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . change of this option does not affect the current program . you need to end &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; end and re@@ boot so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is adjusted above the control centre . )
the following codi@@ fication controls can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you activate this option is used for all entries the upper setting .
&quot; over the sel@@ ections for en@@ coding a short notice , which is the local coding . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal nature . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file key@@ ing for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpret . as the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and brought together with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have dealt a file , you can specify here , which key@@ ing should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processing power , they could not function with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. your files can be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be with 8 @-@ bit ASC@@ II . ) With this option you can determine the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing command@@ ing . &quot;
turn this off in order to supp@@ ress draw@@ backs of changes in white characters in the text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options must ignore or ign@@ oring C / C + + -@@ comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files will see . however , you may only see the differences between two of three files . -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is shown next to the normal yet a second crossing column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ending the less important window . ( this option is located in the window @-@ menu . )
&quot; does the compar@@ isons side next to each other or over@@ turn , this can also be useful to the display of long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . ) &quot;
&quot; sometimes , consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together . a simple click start recording and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as a pre @-@ issued name for output file . ( if this function is used to re @-@ launch , then the name of the last used output will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it will be transferred to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre @-@ processor that suits exactly your needs . you can use this function for example to re@@ use interference or correc@@ ting the reg@@ im@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is handed over to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used to input this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches your own requirements . each entry line has to have a related edition line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when entering the diet results . however , an external program requires , and most users would not want to program yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely suff@@ ice . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for po@@ inters in order to convert the input into large letters : sed &apos; s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; The \ \ 1 in the initial string file refer to the found text in the first gear @-@ string . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the text found in large letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key@@ word to automatically created strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you like this regular expression even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ign@@ oring of numbers is actually a already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . however , it is good for example for another pre @-@ processing command for po@@ len@@ eck suitable for po@@ ckets . &quot; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each one is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted . &quot;
sometimes you may want to perform several versions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different like e.g. perl -@@ p -@@ E &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch &apos; allergy are only compared to perl a few details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs to perl needs perl only ( and ) without the &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; . example :
&quot; data after regular pre@@ dat@@ essor are maintained for viewing and consolidation . the further operations only change the data , which shows the Zei@@ len@@ eck @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the po@@ len@@ ght pre@@ processor command the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ processor command are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit in a folder many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ ital@@ ized and merge . &quot;
... &quot; makes it a suggestion for each object ; you can custom@@ ize the proposal before starting , &quot;
... can simul@@ ate the simul@@ ated and show the simul@@ ated changes without it really perform ;
... &quot; selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is the compar@@ isons and merge of single files very similar . you just need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folder are brought together , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was indicated , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not merge it together . to merge it , you must press the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder you will inform you a little news window on the current progress . if you break the scanning the folder , only the files are listed below that have been compared to that . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and every folder of the scan found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded . you can double click on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrow buttons , and all sub@@ directories will be used with which you can apply all the folder and folders . &quot;
&quot; click on a file , the file will be started and it appears a compar@@ ative window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the dat@@ at@@ ype in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the type @-@ type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case the assem@@ bling action can not be selected automatically . if this will be launched , you will be informed about problems of this kind again . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , are used in columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; however , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered as identical if your overall content is identical . you also have the same color . at folders , age is un@@ significant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let again , which is only green , then yellow , and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... a and C identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... a and B identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not a : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... a , B and C do not have the same fil@@ tering ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this may not be started . &quot;
... a and B does not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this may not be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ ization is active , if only two folder and no explicit target folder , and when the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both folder are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... a and B exist but are not identical : merge and the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for output file only B ; direct to the result copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folder are brought together and the option of new file will take place ( uncertain ) , then investig@@ ates &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and proposes the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange will not be eliminated , the folder may not be started . &quot;
&quot; while bringing together a file after the other ab@@ st@@ . you status column shows fer@@ ous when the result was successful , and corresponding to other messages if something in@@ expected , you should check out a last review and check if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the actu@@ ation dialog the file compar@@ ative method is chosen , K@@ diff@@ 3 further columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts will only be displayed when three folder compared or combined . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the entry entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all assem@@ bling actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can merge it together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a target folder , then the three @-@ folder mode C is used as the target you choose if you choose a two @-@ folder mode , and when syn@@ cing it is used and / or B used as target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries are to be displayed in the folder structure , also in the folder structure . there are several options to be displayed in the folder structure . check these options for un@@ loving surprises : &quot;
to create all entries : choose Direc@@ tions / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key@@ boards ) . to just choose the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conf@@ lic@@ ting data types still do not exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialogue window will appear with the options , simul@@ ate and Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; choose if you want to see what would happen , without which really changes will be made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge to a single file ) then it opens a merge window ( see the screenshot ) .
&quot; when you are ready to start with a file , select again directory and continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialogue will be . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , appears a message and detailed status information . at the end the list you see some error messages that can help you to locate the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select a different action for entry or solve the problem in other ways before you ride along . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been compiled individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries should not be re@@ assembled in the current session ) and will result in later , this entries will be considered . only if you change the combined action , these entries will be re @-@ led again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ performance with these options :
&quot; only files that are shown on the specified pattern , are displayed in the elementary tree . you can separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that suit these patterns will not appear in the elementary tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ der . valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that suit these patterns will not appear in the elementary tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ der . valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many bri@@ g@@ matic files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder is set with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see below info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hiding place . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a file is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files will be displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links will show . this is de@@ activated in the default . &quot;
&quot; for links to the folder : when the option is switched off , the links are treated like normal folder and recur@@ sively sear@@ ched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible rec@@ ur@@ ries . a link to a folder of a link to itself would lead to a continuous loop . ) This option is off in default off . &quot;
&quot; a complete analysis of each file through and displays statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ it@@ ters , uns@@ ol@@ ved and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower when it is applied to files that contain no text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare big folder over a slow network , it may possibly be faster to compare the change date and the file size . however , this speed section does not cost you a certain level of security . please take care of this option . &quot;
similar to familiar with the change of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal in size . this option can be useful when copying the change of change . please use with caution . this option is switched to default .
&quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode , if two folder are compared and not a target folder . in this mode , the proposals to merge the files are identical . also the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is placed in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this will be regarded as uns@@ afe , because it &apos;s knowledge that the other file is not also changed . you should consider this in any case . ) This option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted , then the original version is ren@@ amed and receives the .@@ original backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , this option will also be deleted without further backup . this option is switched on in the default file . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder @-@ based view is visible from the stit@@ ching of single files ; you can switch to the window @-@ window using the mouse . if you don &apos;t want you to switch the option directory &amp; text window to switch main window in window @-@ menu and switch between the two views on the window . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file with double @-@ clicking on the folder . however , you can create a single file directly without the folder menu . once you save the result , the status will be put down and the file will not be re@@ comp@@ led again if you merge the folder . &quot;
&quot; this status will however be lost , if you read the directory again : directory -@@ menu : new &quot;
&quot; KDE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folder for opening files that are on local or remote machines . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a zi@@ pped archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folder . some things should be observed :
&quot; a path may be relative . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ hed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space ) &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol . it follows a brief list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or there can be no distinction , whether a link is shown to a file or a folder . then there will always be a file as a link target . ( FTP : , ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility to edit permission or change date . therefore the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( consider the option to trust the size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently known as differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts at first always the built @-@ in @-@ viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences @-@ viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a cas@@ hier , a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format is . then it takes a patch file in the patch file . then at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work when none of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have been altered since the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ ing of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that lead or the compar@@ isons of folders , is not supported in the K@@ Part Mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now Hei@@ st it comp@@ are ) is already available . besides , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can lead to the program diff@@ using from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL @-@ programs for a very long time and I learned a lot by being sho@@ cked into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or going to be so .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script is probably not communicated to the correct pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default configuration configure / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you can find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters different , these lines are treated as identical : but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will appear as not identical . if the lines appear next to each other , this particular is pro@@ attribute this is the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notices for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . this important information is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking into the source code and selecting the button A / B / C , and there is much effort to design extra their own file format that this information could be saved . &quot;
&quot; the effort has so far been too large . you can recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit amounts of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c was defeated ; and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does this mean and how can that be removed ?
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors for the highlight of differences . even more car@@ eless@@ ness would be conf@@ using , and lacking the purpose . please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need to use &amp; k@@ de , 3.1 or later . &quot;
information as you can use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent amendments can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file .
&quot; to compile and install , on a system with &amp; k@@ de , use the following command at the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE @-@ dir is the folder in your system , installed in the KDE . if you are uncertain , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not encounter any problems when comp@@ iling . should you encounter difficulties , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
cutting ( Str@@ g @-@ X or Shift ) copied in the cli@@ p@@ board and delet@@ es the marked text . insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current C@@ urs@@ or@@ position and replace the current marking .
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders and are not in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you must change to these options the folder with the function Ref@@ res@@ h . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries shown , the differences do . this also leads to that identical files should not be copied into the target folders . if the Target folder has not already been copied , they are absent from later program version . ) This option is off in default off . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for selecting the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines attached out of the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the outcome window ( if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button below . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . Under@@ shift in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ ature of all virtual labour areas . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the places to change their size , to finish them or to postp@@ one it . this works both inside a desktop and more . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual venues , as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . it is possible to move within a desktop as well as other working spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has built only the two entries p@@ ager ... and Be@@ ans . if however , click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; but cli@@ cked on the icon and the name of the application , as well as the entries . the commands make the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
&quot; send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears , only when applied to an application . &quot;
&quot; is this anchor marked , you can move windows within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other places of work . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual space are displayed . &quot;
&quot; select this field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , display the numbers of virtual labour areas . it is covered together with name display , the names of folders will be covered , &amp; eg ; 1st working area . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs will be shown as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . at the same time , only the empty space are indicated to enable them to choose from . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rectangular with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel displays a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager is determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; located in a 2x@@ n cr@@ aster , as out of P@@ ager applications in some other Window@@ maker ; wa@@ agre@@ es shows all virtual labour areas in a wa@@ iter @-@ right and ver@@ tically in a sen@@ k@@ right sequence , which is very good for the representation on the side of the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be displayed in size , display windows as symbols or with its contents . in addition , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right click within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and then select selecting from switch to switch ... leaves the dialog settings seem .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in dialog settings . you can do this manually : &quot;
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ gu@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI@@ . if you don &apos;t have to apply to a user root or login to your system administrator . in this file you must register the key win@@ dow@@ lan@@ s and assign values to this file . possible values are :
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base is , you need a functioning installation of the KDE package . &quot;

&quot; with &amp; km@@ ag . you can enlarge with &amp; km@@ ag ; a part of the screen . this application is interesting for various users : this includes artists , Web @-@ designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is to be a full manual for use of &amp; km@@ ag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly expanding to new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot;
&quot; when you visit &amp; km@@ ag , a window appears like above . the main window of the screen . below , this window is displayed as enlar@@ ging windows . below , this window is displayed as enlar@@ ging windows . below , this window is displayed as enlar@@ ging window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is listed below as the main window . &quot;
in the default setting is enlarged &amp; km@@ ag ; the area around the mouse c@@ ursor as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively you can set a select screen area in enlar@@ ging window ) or the surrounding of the mouse c@@ ursor on the screen ( eg ; at the left side of the screen ) .
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the setting mouse c@@ ursor . please note that is not able to recognize the form of the mouse c@@ ursor . this is always the default file ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ c@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can custom@@ ize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse c@@ ursor in the magnific@@ ation window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fying window and move . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you are in addition the &amp; Shift ; taste pressing or the &amp; M@@ MB , you can postp@@ one the selection window . &quot;
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ window stand fixed and only the lower right hand is to be moved .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; owns a lot of functions . you can upload the enlarged image directly to the printer in a file to add to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , the image is turning and much more . &quot;
starts or stopped the update of the ad . the update of the update causes the required CPU @-@ Time to 0 goes .
&quot; select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very small , Ger@@ ing , means , H@@ och , Very High ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU @-@ time is required . &quot;

&quot; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor a while at the same point . it is intended to help people who suffer at R@@ SI syndrome ( re@@ petition @-@ strain syndrome ) and those of each mouse @-@ click pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor a while at the same point . it is intended to help people who suffer the pro@@ peti@@ tive strain In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse @-@ click pain . moreover , it can fix it with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; * M@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain when clicking the mouse is created and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from the mere loading of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps , which are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the def@@ ying of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be eliminated for everyone . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements , and leads a mouse @-@ click , as soon as you break the movement short . &quot;
&quot; if the smart rel@@ oc@@ ating is activated , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; take a break after it &apos;s pressing the mouse button . in this way , you can finish the drag on the mouse button . this smart rel@@ oc@@ ating requires a little practice , but you get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; this time period must be pet@@ ri@@ dden after the end of the mouse @-@ movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse @-@ click . &quot;
&quot; is enabled Int@@ ellig@@ ent Ver@@ sho@@ ok ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time is set up , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after downloading the mouse button wa@@ its before it hit the mouse button again , if the mouse @-@ mouse button again lets you start . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click through mouse @-@ shift . this function is activated , creates a slow strain on the left and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow motion . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it started , but they can change later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is del@@ ayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the responsi@@ veness to sound &amp; multimedia , choose sound @-@ system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der hit @-@ bu@@ ffer to set you on a lower value to shor@@ ten the responses . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , becomes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; start at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at GNO@@ ME or other window environments , to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; all settings return to values which were set in opening the dialogue . have already applied the button , the settings will be placed on the stand after the last wir@@ ing of the dialog . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with preference . in particular , the smart shift should let you first be switched off . if you then acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the automatic mouse button , you can later move the smart shift . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the responses of &amp; k@@ de ; to decrease in sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : the click on the neutral components of windows or positions in the browser window that will not represent a link , leads not to un@@ woven responses . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse ru@@ ck@@ elt , you should clean@@ se your mouse . that &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse , but also the roles that come with the mouse @-@ ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take the mouse ball . as this happens , it is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can easily switch easily with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks the running of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just use a sho@@ ots , that means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation does not stop anymore through the slogan of the mouse . &quot;
this happens when you &apos;re &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you can perform a mouse @-@ click here . in this , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can work as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continues to run mouse clicks and putting the c@@ ursor to another site . &quot;
&quot; to use the mouse to place the c@@ ursor there , where you want to have it . however , if you don &apos;t want to give your mouse on a neutral area of working space , if you are pressing a short@@ cut reactions . secure zones for the mouse @-@ spac@@ er are &amp; eg ; the gray areas for the tool@@ bar and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit it . &quot;
&quot; the smart rel@@ oc@@ ating is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time to copy it in this way . it is very well possible to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add any other action , where you &apos;ll probably move the mouse at it . here are some advice to it : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart shift , if you just start doing it km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; take text instead , run a mouse click here , while you move the mouse button , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and enter the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . therefore , each mouse button gets played a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so you know exactly when in the intelligent moving the temp@@ o period begins . later you can use the smart shift also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use to be able to use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should already be the case on most system . &quot;
&quot; the functionality of the cli@@ cked mouse clicks is only available , when the system features a sound card and speakers and these correctly is furnished . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor briefly twi@@ sted , this program was developed for people who are suffering at R@@ SI syndrome and those who are p@@ onder@@ s the mo@@ wing pain . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that it is a certain time waiting for a drag procedure , before the mouse button will start . in this way the pul@@ ling can also be done with the mouse . &quot;

the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; is clearly visible and contains essentially a input field for the short@@ cut of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and a thr@@ ust of the already spoken assem@@ blies ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you have km@@ outh ; correctly , you can enter the propositions you want to hear in the input field that you want to hear . each spoken set is attached to the delay memory . you can choose from these propositions which should be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings km@@ outh ; set up ... open the setup dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; this dialog contains two cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the page of vocabulary , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the map version , you give the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , you set the character key@@ note that will be shared with text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the cross@@ roads , if the text remains unchanged as standard input to language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ field is not selected , the text is shared as a parameter . you can use the following pieces of space : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with as possible as language service to use &amp; km@@ outh ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings are available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ e @-@ language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ em@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications is a stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed interface for voice issues . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first drop @-@ selection action after selecting a text drive , determine which action is triggered by the key@@ boards or by selecting a text drive in the menu text@@ box manual or in the cor@@ rug@@ ged for text@@ books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of instant mess@@ enger , the selected text drive will be written directly and inserted in addition to the memory modules . with the selection of in the input field , the selected text drive will first be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ box manual for text @-@ pass@@ agen@@ ers , you can define if the text@@ box manual is automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when you save changes the book will save the book . if you want to change , the text@@ box is not saved . ask for saving queries , will be stored &amp; km@@ outh ; ask if the text@@ box is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the page of vocabulary contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary field . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; km@@ outh ; a selection range , when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection , you can select the currently used dictionary for vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right , you can delete or add the order of books or export them into a file . beneath the list you can adjust the name and drop the language for the dictionary . &quot;
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation one . the frequency of the individual words is simply obtained through the count of the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org @-@ dictionary to insert only correct words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh , ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries are combined , and how this wei@@ ghted should be harv@@ ested . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; km@@ outh ; newly set words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for the processing of text box is split . in the upper part , the text@@ box are shown as a tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected item . if you have selected a text name , you can change the text theme or the belonging keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text editor , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; to add actions such as new text pass@@ ag@@ ages or books or delete selected text passages and books , you can either reach either the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a pop@@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text pass@@ ag@@ rams or text passages , you can move through drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; &quot;
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise , otherwise , the selected areas of the exp@@ ires . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used , otherwise , the selected ranges of the pass @-@ storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise , the selected test of the exp@@ ires . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is crossed , a movable tool@@ bar with buttons is indicated directly under the menu bar . by mouse @-@ click on the fin@@ pressing left side and pul@@ ling can be moved to the tool@@ bar to another point . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is crossed , a narrow cor@@ ds in the lower part of the main window with indications of the state of &amp; km@@ outh ; indicated if not comp@@ elled , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is crossed , a movable type of text box is displayed directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ click on the fin@@ pressing left side and pul@@ ling can be moved to the tool@@ bar to another point . &quot;
probably you don &apos;t have the command for voice issue properly or not completely inspired . open settings km@@ outh ; set up the page General settings and enter the command for voice issue on the map version . ( see the setup dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer to further details . )
&quot; the festival is a language @-@ over@@ s system of the University Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the attitude of the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the directory / usr / local / festival . the command to voice is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; li@@ zed language generator . currently he only supports the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions on any restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the instruction line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . language version is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must send data as standard input . ( this is recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ emen into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei . therefore , you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to use the final character of the text , so that an extra character has to be made . the full command is therefore more costly than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ F _ usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / d@@ 1 / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option data as a standard input must be switched on .
&quot; the voice of L@@ äm@@ on von &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which is available to all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different languages . &quot;
&quot; as the setting of language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; km@@ outh . &quot;
&quot; to the setting , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language mer@@ it , which will be installed in the setup dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; successfully use , you need a language generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; takes about 15 MB storage ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; km@@ outh is an application , with the people who can not speak to allow text by calcul@@ ators . there is a list already stored @-@ pro@@ chen@@ er movements that can give the user again and again . &quot;

&quot; filter for drawing @-@ replacement service provide a good opportunity to fix , correct or correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included for delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . you removed the tags br and b from the news that may be sent by mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box because this can be accepted in most cases than provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is edited , before he is sent to Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation , select false words or abbrevi@@ ations to select a matching language and speakers or to avoid certain defects of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their votes . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of fil@@ tering , it is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen @-@ re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be with@@ drawn from all other orders , and maintains this orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the raised orders will be continued . &quot;
warning is the next priority . this level is important messages as &amp; eg ; processor is becoming hot@@ ly reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the output of the warning .
&quot; News have the next highest priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application , the news used . while you can read a long text on a website , you can join &amp; km@@ outh ; ask someone who are straight to the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notices are also news . read this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text messages . each order that you encounter from the map @-@ card orders is a text supplement . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text entries . text messages are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queue , except the output of screen cage . when an application fails the output of a screen re@@ aders , while there is such a pre @-@ reads , this issue is stopped and ended . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen cage . you will be applied to normal al@@ arms , news and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; drawing @-@ ket@@ tes , replace parts of a text by other text . to set out parts , you can either specify as words or as regular expres@@ sions , which will enable the adoption of chat em@@ ot@@ icons such as : - ) by text or for form@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Def@@ former use an X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to convert to another format . included in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SLT files to the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker op@@ ters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set a female voice for example , you can read text of KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. in addition to read . &quot;
&quot; each of these various filters has adjustable rules , for which he is applied for voice @-@ over@@ s . if the filter does not exist , he returns the text unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text yield , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification of notice is sent , it is furnished by all activated filters which are set down on the page below . the processing through the filter is set up in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of furnished normal filters . if a filter does not be activated , it is not activated and is not used . filter are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will display the further below furnishings . &quot;
&quot; for the installation of strings access fil@@ tering you need to enter a list of words or regular expression as a comparison . will these patterns be found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text . large and small @-@ off is not considered . &quot;
&quot; for your filter name , enter a name for your filter . this name you can choose any number , it just needs to differentiate yourself from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expression . the filter compar@@ es the text containing the strings in the column of correspondence and replaces him in accordance with the string chain from the column . the list is shown in the indicated order from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular excer@@ pts from a file to save the current list or delete a list of file , the entries are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is used only when the speaker addresses one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button down . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is used only when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can type multiple programs separately by comm@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application ID run @-@ of programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ numbers need to leave you . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the applic@@ ability ID Cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 shows you only allowed to insert copied .
&quot; the drawing tank filter is applied only to the text , when all conditions apply with one entry in the box Di@@ esen filter when match . are all input cells , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compared with words , the string @-@ chain filters use regular expression in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ der ( space ) . &quot;
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expression . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; instruc@@ tors installed as help to connect these expres@@ sions . the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; phrases can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Def@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT files from one format to another format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such forming units . however the auxiliary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H also extends x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the intercom optional filter , you can send text to a certain speaker , who is set up on the map spokes@@ person , or an speaker with certain properties . you can also specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ on ; there is a speaker to the filters , there is a spokes@@ person for the text . the speaker is selected by the spokes@@ person , which indicates the text editor , and the properties of the speakers on the map connection . with the intercom optional filter you can write the chosen spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is applied if the text is used in a given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular press , you can call this clicking on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression in the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you specify the characteristics of the desired speaker . if the text has been met at the above mentioned filter conditions , the speaker is selected to indicate the desired requirements most suitable . click on the button on the right to show the dialog language selection . &quot;
use this buttons to store or load your microphone settings or to delete all settings .
the inter@@ viewer filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you need to apply at least one condition .
&quot; voice issue API , from &amp; k@@ de ; to lend their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that you can use this syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice issue API of &amp; k@@ de ; for the full documentation for both AP@@ Is you can find on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility page ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require language guidance via the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is text of text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more orders you can use . for a list of all commands give you
open two &amp; kon@@ sole ; window . start first on a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ forming filter , but when using the module for festival Web sites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to a bug in the Festival of 1.@@ 95 , you need to install the ( Male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ BLE does not work , so that you don &apos;t have to use this voice for reading web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or point of point appear to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences is issued or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option Dra@@ en@@ coding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be fixed by a drawing tank filter . &quot;

&quot; the syn@@ thesizer , which can be used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or in the respective websites . there are also voices that have an own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the KDE source archive , you can download the package en@@ coding with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can also find the source code of file @-@ file on ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
contains many languages : a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the page web http : / / vide@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net / langu@@ ages@@ .html .
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
KT@@ TS also works with each language syn@@ thesizer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; kon@@ sole .
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages to rate . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that is not yet contained in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses a adap@@ table module for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for using another syn@@ thesi@@ zers , please contact the developer &apos;s team . &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter but is not mandatory . de@@ bian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile , compile , you need a current development environment of KDE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the winding files for the program &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from source pane , you have downloaded and downloaded the tar@@ ball on every night , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you visit &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , check if Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . this allows you to use the SPD @-@ conf file . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; in &amp; k@@ de , 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ on ; which is supposed to be further developed the program Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is supposed to be further developed , and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual movements . the user can proceed or reject , repeat the output or break down . &quot;
&quot; when an application form text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; gives an application for example a female English spokes@@ person . if you have appointed a spokes@@ person , whose language English and its gender is female , this is otherwise automatically selected automatically by the most suitable speakers . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; an speaker cho@@ oses to see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the map speaker to add or click on the map for the list , the map of the module is shown . as an example is shown below the set of the module for Festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found under . &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable Fes@@ tival@@ Program . if the path to the festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H you only need to enter festival .
&quot; select the text en@@ coding for text , which is passed to festival . at voices that are handed over to festival , this setting is automatically made . generally speaking , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you will add volume , speaker speed , and pitch @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you can not select some regul@@ ator and displayed it the gray one lets you not choose the settings chosen by you . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require multiple seconds to be loaded on account of their size . if you loaded this approach , these voices will already be charged when the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( in a large storage power ) the first set is faster to syn@@ thesi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; if this attack cannot be selected , you do not have to set up an speaker ( or forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; this is marked by the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the program window kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start it is only the symbol of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this approach is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr still does not run , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . therefore , you have the possibility to read or otherwise control it . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the straight set proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map spokes@@ person spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can proceed in the order that is selected in the list below , or go back - ( but not every order consists of multiple sets ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes in settings are taken over ( also on the other cardboard cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be res@@ ized to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead as AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ en , click on the map audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text messages are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , war@@ nings and messages are not shown . &quot;
&quot; select the kind of audio version . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled and kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module or kt@@ ts ; the necessary libraries can not load . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de for the audio version is to be used , click here the audio output . if no output modules are installed in the list , you need to install at least one module . see AL@@ SA selected , select the PC@@ M device . see also the PC@@ M device . &quot;
&quot; Set the same speed here . 50@@ free ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ free ; % approximately the double normal intercom speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click here to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device is working with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this map , you can set specific actions that will always be executed when the text is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be with@@ drawn from all other orders , and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the hal@@ ted orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warning are the nearest @-@ grade priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is becoming hot@@ ly reserved . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning again .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application that speaks News . if you can read a long text on a website , you can welcome someone with &amp; km@@ outh ; nevertheless someone welcome someone who enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen rec@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio @-@ over@@ s in the queue . &quot;
&quot; the audio file will always be re@@ played when a regular text is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound are active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map will apply only for normal text messages . for messages , war@@ nings , and the issues of screen readers , there are no special actions if these are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click notification . the map of al@@ erts appear . &quot;
&quot; select this approach to switch reading &amp; k@@ de ; adjustment not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and dict@@ ated ; reads no noti@@ fications before . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , will al@@ erts when a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use this buttons to add events to the list , or delete it . if you click on the button Select , a dialog will be able to add to the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation , sent when someone mentioned in an IR@@ C message to your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list are nothing else indicated , will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; use this selection tool to set what is done , when an event takes place . you have the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following pieces of space : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard choose the speaker , which is shown on the list on the map spokes@@ person as the top entry . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a particular event is defined for events . otherwise , the action will run for all the other events of the particular application . as a last chance , the action is defined for carrying out under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event All notices for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you may specify the registr@@ ations as below :
use the button save to load the settings for noti@@ fications in one file . use the button load to load stored settings from a file . if you want to begin with an empty list please click Clear . all entries will be deleted . all entries will be deleted .
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to highlight text for voice output , the speaker cable , the volume , the sex voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of such as abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish mascul@@ ine ) , as this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or tape in the Festival configur@@ ations is not set to 100@@ free ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ coding = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ coding / / EN / Spe@@ ech @-@ Syn@@ thesis / syn@@ th@@ es@@ is@@ .@@ dt@@ d &quot; &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama B@@ är . who has slept in my bed ? asked the Bär@@ en@@ Child . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ality rot@@ ational filter ( SD@@ B @-@ Filter ) . this allows you to proceed quickly , because only the first set of syn@@ thesi@@ zed there is only the first proposition . thus , you can also jump or stop or break down , even if the voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers this not directly supported . &quot;
here you can see the stat@@ utes limit@@ less recognizable . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is automatically set up a pro@@ posi@@ tional sign @-@ off filter . you can change its settings or add further pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter but beginn@@ s will be dis@@ continued .
&quot; the easiest way you learn how to try out the intercom selection by selecting and give text to read . check the microphone selection again , which you need to set up some properties and check how to set up the speaker settings . of course you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; then faster with the code can start , as only the first set must be processed and not the whole block , which can last very long , &quot;
you then print text messages then on the map @-@ card orders or break down even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
&quot; for these reasons the normal stat@@ utes is automatically set up , if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . he can not be off , just removed . change nothing to this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
pro@@ posi@@ tional refu@@ eling filter compare text with a regular expression for typ@@ ing and add a tab@@ ular code ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional limits ( tab is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter is attached .
&quot; S@@ BD @-@ Filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de , messages , messages , messages or the output of screen @-@ re@@ a@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from laying down the normal stat@@ utes of limit@@ less recognizable filter , you can insert it again by load the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
on the map controllers that you can write the inter@@ viewer settings for the application . the card card is displayed when
use of the default speaker ( the top one on the map spokes@@ person ) . in other words : there are no inter@@ speaker properties .
&quot; use of the appropriate speaker , which indicates all the features of a furnished speaker . if you don &apos;t delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select the speaker . otherwise , the speaker cho@@ oses , the most commonly issued characteristics . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select here the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , don &apos;t give anything . &quot;
&quot; select this case , if the property shall prevail over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here . &quot;
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it will always be treated as a priority property . you &apos;ll be able to use this property only if you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the section spokes@@ person , the most suitable to delete , click on the pres@@ sible pres@@ ach@@ ers and then use on speakers , which corresponds to the test . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 for the last text is in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr rus@@ hes immediately when it started . I have taken de@@ bug support but I do not get a review .
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is ab@@ duc@@ ted and made there ; probably you need to register your Stre@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , it is possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ streams . &quot;
&quot; the audio version of AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application music . if I consider a text supplement , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message that says : real@@ to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA can occur , which can prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . references for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA @-@ Projects ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I loaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr shows this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int / c@@ utter the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; where you found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the map audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program has to be installed and controlled via the operation variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ ologists like Festival Interactive offer yourself an adjustment for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the spokes@@ person will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML ) . SS@@ ML has its own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) de@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are totally cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML res@@ sources , and set the talk speed . &quot;
&quot; I do not run it to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokes@@ person , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at the Festival of 1.@@ 95 , the day SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER does not appear to work . thus , the festival does not produce any error , the X@@ SL file to converting the SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . the same applies also to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
I have added a own string qu@@ eting filter and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer mark@@ ings or go back . on the Kart@@ ei@@ gh orders will be shown that order not only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; inter@@ locking signs ( point , question mark , plates , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not filter you . use for these signs instead a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is already installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer in the version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer , by placing the command G@@ ST register . ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org ) &quot;
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio version . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and read a text . you can also start reading a text and then start a further . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with date of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support a real rest . if you hold a text editor in a review , the current sentence will be read yet . &quot;

&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many votes you can adjust volume , appointments and pitch @-@ height . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are supplied with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( Male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you have to compile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on transmission . &quot;
&quot; this voice is called 1,@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / passenger / Russian / . if you enter Russian voices , you must type for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ril@@ lic ( 8 bit bit@@ ch ) coding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival usually contains in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions you are looking for first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option has to be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;

&quot; this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , which enables the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings over a single , integrated user interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP networking settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; it can be started with selection of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be able and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and the setting of the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed in installing and installed . network equipment later added , the drivers must be loaded according to the following files , according to the core version : &quot;
the module settings will be loaded when the option settings is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; tag is selected . while starting the module settings tries to detect the platform on the system automatically .
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the nearest selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release version will be best suited . by selecting the setting no @-@ once , the setting will be permanently shut down . at the next start of network settings , this selection will be automatically shut . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means you can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management system , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders : &quot;
the rider network interfaces also serves to manage the network equipment . all available network devices are displayed . the following functions can be performed . the following functions can be performed :
the settings suggested by selecting the desired device in the list and selecting the button to set up ... in the dialog instrument set up .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are required for the system together with the start of the system services . in the selection list , no further attitude required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , selected . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Manu@@ ell , the TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask is the type of networks . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , initi@@ alizes the network interface with the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled . &quot;
the values given in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the tool@@ bar .
it should be assured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; kon@@ sole ; you may notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network equipment can be activated or activated depending on your needs . switch off an operating network device through selecting from the list and clicking on interface .
network equipment can be activated or activated depending on your needs . switch off in a activated network device through selecting from the list and selecting interface to dis@@ able ....
&quot; puts the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which conv@@ eys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub @-@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if on computer is present more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the net in which the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name replaced by the appropriate IP address . that is necessary because computers can only be used by IP addresses . if the computer is used http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org . if the computer is used to use this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine to nam@@ ing the nam@@ ental nam@@ ing solution enables a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified wer@@ .@@ DNS entries can be arranged by selection of an entries and execution or flo@@ or@@ ings in the list with the buttons or her@@ ding in the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; Add ... &quot; &quot; from the group calcul@@ ator a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog of New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then enter the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; . &quot; the entry is inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to nam@@ ing solution , select an entry and then click on the button editing .... It will be the dialog editing . &quot;
&quot; the list of well known computers describes computers @-@ to @-@ IP address for TCP / IP Sub@@ system . it is used primarily on bo@@ oting , when no DNS server is available . in small , locked networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
usually the list may include some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are not yet available in this test version of IP .
enter the IP address of the familiar machine and click Add to Add .... The dialog of New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
enter the name of the known calcul@@ ator and add the button to add multiple ali@@ ases that push button to add multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of an especially known machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialog familiar machine will be shown .
&quot; one of the following tasks can be executed , then with clicking on OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings required in the module settings are not immediately available in the system . to enable the changes , it must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly r@@ pm @-@ packages ) , when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphic interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool for its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition the development packages with libraries and other things are required . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology will be given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; this section can not replace relevant knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the integration of PCs into a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; currently IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) is operated . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found wide distribution . from IP@@ v@@ 6 , it is expected in the near future . this description is now focusing on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is aware of what IP address is to assign to a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the contact agent , which is available via a valid IP address or if available , the IP address can not simply be chosen arbitr@@ ary ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own little ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area for this purpose to prevent IP address Con@@ fli@@ cts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , so it is possible to use any use . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be facilit@@ ated by setting another gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks are usually used to address 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is big enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the network mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the width of the lo@@ op@@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for IP address . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP @-@ traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of one &apos;s so called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions available . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically changed at DSL connections , so it is not surprising when in case of active DSL connections to find another content . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; S@@ USE , is known that this file will be split by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand than expected can occur . &quot;

&amp; k@@ soldier ; is a backup programme for band@@ ages on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you sec@@ ures ?
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be involved by &amp; k@@ soldier ; that can be done on three ways : &quot;
&amp; k@@ soldier ; sp@@ ain the band back and reads the pr@@ elo@@ ad of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pres@@ ch@@ et on the tape will not be asked if the belt is to be form@@ ated .
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pres@@ ent@@ ann , looking for the right index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked whether the band index should be re@@ created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the belt de@@ werk to indicate that the band is integrated . in the status bar there is a corresponding message . the content of the tape can now be sear@@ ched by the entry of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the ban@@ ker , first the inclusion must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; there is a change in the band by changing the symbols for the band , that the inclusion of the band was resolved and displays a corresponding message in the stat@@ us@@ bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a volume of &amp; k@@ soldier can be used , it must be dated by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a strap @-@ cards must be form@@ ated before you may be used for saving data . this procedure does not need to be used to form@@ atting , it has to happen before you are dated to the band of &amp; k@@ dat . float @-@ belt works usually do not place a form@@ atting of the tape , DAT drives , on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all the data on the tape are lost ! upon completion of the form@@ atting , the belt is automatically integrated and can be used . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup , you need to select the files that may happen . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in local file tree . it will only be backed by this file or the folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . it will only be backed up to the files stated in the profile .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folder are secured .
right click on the local file tree and choose in the menu ...
&quot; once the backup was initiated , the dialogue will open up for secure . in this dialog , you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will be backup . the dialogue shows the progress of the backup , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
highlight a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or the folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
right click on one of the archives and choose the menu item .
&quot; once the audit process has been started , the dialogue will be set for verification . in this dialog , you can once check your selection and change the procedures for verification . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialogue will be re@@ viewing . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process , as well as the exec@@ uting time and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initi@@ ate the re @-@ establish , the files will be restored , which are to be restored , this can be done in two ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which includes an entry for the belt spro@@ ckets . only the selected file or the sub@@ folder is restored . &quot;
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . it will be restored only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and choose to re @-@ establish in the menu .
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialogue will be set to restore . in this dialog , you can once check your selection and change the work folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will be re @-@ making . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the exec@@ uting time and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ index@@ file on the basis of the band content . this process uses all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band : &quot;
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current employment folder in which the backup should be done . the list of in@@ sured files is automatically updated accordingly .
&quot; for all the folder , which are listed under backup files , that only those files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folder , which are installed on other fil@@ es@@ ystems . each entry is provided by tar independent from the other . &quot;

the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
you can set the settings in the menu item for the menu ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device works for the belt spro@@ ckets ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ring variant of the band .
&quot; is this setting active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the belt is integrated the command to load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reader or write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , stri@@ ves &amp; k@@ dat ; the ej@@ ection to bul@@ lock in the belt . possibly this setting does not work at all band@@ width . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the dis@@ appearance of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically rejected the band . use this option not at Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ n block size for the belt spro@@ ckets . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must communicate &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band@@ width . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ soldier ; a band formed , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only collect one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( N Byte ) The format of this string is bar@@ code : seconds , whereby one is the name of the complete name of the system in which the belt has been formally dated . seconds is the number of seconds that has been formally dated since the epoch where the band has been formally dated . &quot;
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat files .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup script . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system lo@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system prot@@ ector . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows for fast access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&quot; this program provides users to understand what your computer is stored in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , which cannot know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is stored on the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features , with whose help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has a number of useful features . these include among other things :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following displays , presents &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features available , with whose help get the individual protocol lines easily fil@@ tering and sor@@ ting out . the individual options for the sor@@ ting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start is temp@@ ted &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , the most important protocol @-@ file system - to open the system protocol . the protocol files will not be displayed on Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no justi@@ fication for reading . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter after a chosen crit@@ erion . in the default column , the selection of log files will be displayed automatically so that only a log file will appear next to the filter . then a protocol line contains the listing . in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included . &quot;
&quot; you can select from this point of course another entry . the string of the filter protocol will then select only with the entries in the corresponding column . select the name of a process , which shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines , which is sent to the process or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors will be shown with a striking colour display as protocol line . the colored representation of protocol @-@ lines can be switched off .
&quot; if you just want to display a specific process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , for example , you can examine the process of a particular command such as the launch of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use fil@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window , in order to display all new additions to the next protocol . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature displays the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system lo@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ org. &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it editor , more known ( and in the following also so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is rapidly developing as the standard for the control of the programme at the top of the system in the &amp; Linux ; for this reason , because it is easier to use , powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it @-@ binary file is located at / s@@ bin and not under / etc This is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on system V In@@ it , without having a rein@@ st@@ allation and rein@@ format . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from BSD in@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service that would like to start from the system or change to another Run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services include not such things as set@@ ters that will only once start . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; in turn , the r@@ c.@@ local should be located in the / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems even do this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the seri@@ ousness connection . &quot;
the kernel searches for various locations according to the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
&quot; by default Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab , you should see one line like the following : &quot;
&quot; at this point , you can throw a look into the second column and probably find that the vor@@ tex @-@ level Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab from hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you re@@ vise your system by opening the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you would like to enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably will see something like this : &quot;
you will notice which are in this folder no correct files . instead , each entry here is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is written , that it is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start the scripts in hand on the command line as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains K , the script will be called to the argument . if he includes an S , the script will start with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server @-@ Run@@ level , that lets only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; walking ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ inters is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of Avail@@ able System@@ services on one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or to stop ) .
&quot; you can also shift scripts between Run@@ lev@@ le or change the position within a level by moving it differently . however , the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or his position ) . this will only happen if you draw an entry out of the area of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you want to drag them into a new zone . to simply copy it to a new Run@@ level , you have to select explicitly from the menu editing or from the context menu and even if the same entry has previously existed previously in the target zone . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no possibility to restore messages that have been thrown in the tr@@ ash , so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able System@@ services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the C@@ ursor buttons to make a selection of top or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another Run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X use ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to modify the sor@@ row number or the name of a request manually , press the entry button to switch between different fields . use the dialog by rede@@ em@@ ate the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the menu will require a confirmation prior to being executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be extrac@@ ted in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored modifications to pre @-@ settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ les and now the machine starts up @-@ to @-@ date . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default @-@ level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
&quot; I have planned some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for implementation at Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit suppl@@ ementary files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way , such as system services can be started in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use a different distribution : please check whether all the configuration files are present ( and also , whether they are in the correct folder ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) do not end without a message when their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient , the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you made modifications , you must store this . either you use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry in the menu File . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two boxes cards , the user interface and the user interface . to the processing , select the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user interface or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some boxes will only be displayed when you have advanced system settings . only when you are activated advanced settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users will appear , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ ces are installed . &quot;
map Pass@@ word Pass@@ word will be published if shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD -@@ Uni@@ ces are installed .
this map @-@ card appears only if for at least one appears file space . Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ es@@ ystem ) . here you can change parameters for each user while the space restrictions are specified in KB :
&quot; these parameters can be adjusted for each file system , the current file system is selected by means of the field file system with space restrictions . &quot;
&quot; map groups inform@@ s about the group members of the selected user . the standard group , which the user belongs , can be found in the field Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore the user can become a member in other groups by clicking it in the big field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties tab contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select Add from the menu user or group or click on the appropriate button button of the tool@@ bar . editing or delet@@ ing the selected user or the selected group . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ Manager to remove the boot password , remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change , modify and more . &quot;
