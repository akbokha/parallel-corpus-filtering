<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what chemically possible is. another raise finally creates a negative image that so does not produce on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">"this is an example of the solar movement. the original image is the (1), and the (2), which applied intensity is 30%."</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filters recreates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it differs from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrasteful effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy to make sure many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for one on day light-optimized replace. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors with daylight and high contrasts, but also a number of photographers, especially those who hardly distinguishes landscapes, too much."</seg>
<seg id="416">"the Neonfilter sipates neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider reps the strength of the neonliché. at large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light-conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the paint contrast and the luminosity of the photos. you can to experiment with the various colour aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu and you can use the button below. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo with bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one to great saturation. even in this case, the tool is reduced to increase the saturation instead of increasing them. all changes you can perform in the preview. if Him would like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool Gradation and the simple luminosity / contrasts / Gamma is the tool of sound-correction to improve the exposure. even if dialogue on this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of slider. more concrete the three slider below the histograms."</seg>

<seg id="480">"sharpness is a traditional tool for the sharpness. it is very fast and simple, but generates especially in dark areas, grading images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"unsharpened mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture sharper. indeed, it works more psychovisuell. you can use it to be atmospheric Dunst and it's here a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"rekindosing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters for adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitised images need a correction of the sharpness. this in turn leads to a common color combined with only minimum differences. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more detrimental less than regular cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG images, a camera internal sharpness has been applied. images in the raw format, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner can turn a sharpened page during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you will get control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness tool. you can call you with the menu of the menu."</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should be dealing carefully as the results do not seem very natural: the sharpness of the edges, but increases the harness of the edges, but amplify it via the menu entry. you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: one picture is too tight. the solution to draw a bit soft is much easier than it is to sharpening. use the tool to draw a soft sign with the menu supplement, and experiment something with settings. the padlock on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview can help edit the image. the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should first be tried out. if you make the unsharpened mask, become smoker and the impression of grats close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radio. you should therefore sharpened pictures of the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped picture to be added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling is worth a break from the maximum RGB value and to apply the difference. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempt from sharpening and hence stillness in many faces, celestial and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a pig = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitization; tool Refokussing refocused on a picture through improving the sharpness. it used to be used by copyright-protected filtering filters -algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to create a picture of & quot; refocused approach; this is better approach than trying to sharpens the photo. this is a better approach than just trying to sharpens the photo. you can usually start the use of an inshark mask. you can start using it from the menu by clicking on colors revocation in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular Faltung operates much better than the Gauß's Faltung. the Gauß's Faltung has a very long tail, depending on the original pixel. the FIR Vienna inverse of the palate's Faltung is also influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixel. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular Faltung. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images the default value should put 1 good results. you can put a higher value if your image should be very blurred then click on Heiligenpons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0.95 and respective. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"ruckfilter: an increase in the smoker filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful. however, values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful. however, values higher than 0.1 is very poor. a high value is 0.03. a high value will continue to consume the image."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your insharpened Gauß'sch is. in most cases, you should use this value in 0 to run annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you might also have to increase the correlation and / oderhops."</seg>
<seg id="503">"Matridescent size: this value determines the size of the transformational speed. however, an increase in matrixes can choose good results, especially if you select large values for the circular foam or palate's sharpness. however, in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refund parameters that you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cuts, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but leave later inpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you are reading pictures and compress compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurred masking can produce better results as sharpness. this could be caused by being blurred masking a larger neighbourhood used as sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, invaluable masking must always generate artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never indicate the effect of the unsharpened filter. practically, the result of the FIR-filter is always at least as good as the insharpened mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in handling small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can make a comparison between the different filtering, on a small unfocused picture, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour picture has to be corrected. this picture has been made using an analogous camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto-focus linse.</seg>

<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should normally offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme" = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice. "</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 MB = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compressible rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music by young people, portable devices and Autostereosystems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane" = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting. "</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information, which are manually entered or by the program automatically obtained from the freeDB over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be delivered / used with & kaudiocreator; and the Kodiererprogram to create the folder and file name, as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with codile programs, there is often a combination of programmations for the codification and these parameters here. the manual or the help for the Kodierern declare the switch for these programs."</seg>

<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a list of reflectors on the online call of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (generally created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading programme is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files to my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used to know more exactly, search in source code.... It has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed first, if this is not yet done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"for saving the WAV files, the Kodierer can be chosen and thus the desired file format are chosen. in the opening lists are pre-defined entry for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (air-free compression for audio data) on the tab. other Kodiers can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer-package must be installed from the particular Linux distribution system before the Kodierer can be used. this is also required for the predefined coaster. for more information about Kodiers are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a Kodierer, you can get more information on his switch by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a consolation window (eg; sole)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check out the device the device recording of the & CD; / DVD drives, and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio-Kodierer of your choice (lame for MP3s, FLAC & etc;) installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give a reference to what is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>

<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not be able to read it at any way out of a & CD, once the appropriate settings are found."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing will be delivered to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">"common / dev / CDROM is a symbolic link to the actual device drawing of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, the effective device can also be accessed and an attempt with the existing entries are available for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives."</seg>

<seg id="1558">"aside from this example is further to note: if you want to enter everything manually, you activate the selection fields and freeDB if you want to use the database before. however, this over 620 MB large, consider this twice whether this is worth it. to start freeDB in the Offline mode, at least the first. the mode will be installed on the following map."</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely essential for synthesizer, which are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-map general-MIDI events translated into events that understand the synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet and thus always used a trumpet if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you have only one soundcard, you don't need any MIDI map because all Soundcards GM -are compatible (incl. Awe - and CIS cards, FM -devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI-maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that saves all necessary conversions for the playback of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section that may appear as often as desired. however, that every appearance has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "name of the keyboard..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END THE END... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">"you see that Define is used to indicate that a section is starting (except for Options) and AND, that the end of a section has reached."</seg>
<seg id="1660">"please send me your map file as e-mail, so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support may be available for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible."</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard will be illustrated. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equation are ignored. it is believed that the GM -patches are available in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllkeysTo M is used to create all sounds that supports this instrument, with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (GM-Patch 127), you can add a Drum (e.g. with clay 60), the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (gun signal), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term condrum patch of patch is meant that every sound is a different percussional instrument (Drum, basin, Maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone also means the key height of the always identical drum, (like him some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to provide such as notes on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can use multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to make notes on the Perkussions channel. check out for example the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to prevent some channels to others. if you want to switch for example the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (general MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section so has 16 lines, numbered between 0 and 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will need to be defined in the file. if you need the Forcepatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case a patch is always used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch can be useful for example to always use the perkussions patch on the perendsions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates, in which proportion Pitch Bender's events will be multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used, thus in the map file not decimal commas."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM proposes that a Pitch Bender Event will win with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards to play two notes up to a octave. to try the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find this in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canal view is a window with a whole range of pivival (one for each MIDI channel). on these pipelvis you see which sounds are being played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list, where you can choose an instrument, lights are not green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played tones. view in the menu settings below the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed-LCD shows the speed, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. so if you find e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the speed, speed, & etc.. thus, the same MIDI file lead to two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I cannot force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while an mp3-file is required (a compressionary frame of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a Binding distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; have been compiled by & kmid; without Awe support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download a source distribution and install (for example by kmid; 's Home) "</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files individually."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"agree to support & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, choose any files, and drag them onto the & kmid; window."</seg>

<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there were no indications of the places where maybe only the regimation had changed. that's the result of these changes was a little nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white signs. later, a lot more useful features have been added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you would like to compare text, just copy it to the clipboard and add it to one of the comparisons windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way combined will be fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently from one piece of coders and show changes. the original file (the base) helps recharming the exact change. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot displays three Quell files in the following:</seg>

<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors will be shown with a striking colour display as protocol line. the colored representation of protocol-lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you just want to display a specific process (e.g. in the system protocol or in cron protocol), for example, you can examine the process of a particular command such as the launch of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case you use filtering."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window, in order to display all new additions to the next protocol."</seg>

<seg id="2954">& ksystem lolog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. "</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder of & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; system V Init editor, more known (and in the following also so named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is rapidly developing as the standard for the control of the programme at the top of the system in the & Linux; for this reason, because it is easier to use, powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init-binary file is located at / sbin and not under / etc This is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on system V Init, without having a reinstallation and reinformat. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init is also different from BSD init, that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service that would like to start from the system or change to another Runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services include not such things as setters that will only once start. such views belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"in turn, the rc.local should be located in the / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems even do this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the seriousness connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for various locations according to the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"by default Runlevel is in / etc / inittab, you should see one line like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can throw a look into the second column and probably find that the vortex-level Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. be very careful when you revise your system by opening the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you would like to enter in rc3.d, you probably will see something like this:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice which are in this folder no correct files. instead, each entry here is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how starts and stops init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is written, that it is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start the scripts in hand on the command line as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains K, the script will be called to the argument. if he includes an S, the script will start with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server-Runlevel, that lets only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; walking;, Network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointers is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of Available Systemservices on one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or to stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also shift scripts between Runlevle or change the position within a level by moving it differently. however, the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or his position). this will only happen if you draw an entry out of the area of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you want to drag them into a new zone. to simply copy it to a new Runlevel, you have to select explicitly from the menu editing or from the context menu and even if the same entry has previously existed previously in the target zone."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no possibility to restore messages that have been thrown in the trash, so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to activate the different working areas (Available Systemservices, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the Cursor buttons to make a selection of top or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another Runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X use) and add it to the desired Runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to modify the sorrow number or the name of a request manually, press the entry button to switch between different fields. use the dialog by redeemate the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the menu will require a confirmation prior to being executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets will be extracted in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they will be saved by & ksysv; restored modifications to pre-settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runlevles and now the machine starts up-to-date. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default-level at a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have planned some system services with & ksysv; for implementation at Runlevel X, but they will not be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you need to edit supplementary files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way, such as system services can be started in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; are planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use a different distribution: please check whether all the configuration files are present (and also, whether they are in the correct folder). some services (such as eg; Apache and httpd) do not end without a message when their configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual can be added."</seg>
