&quot; although I visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally large .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American films , played an American music , American authors read and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; when 14 years old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gr@@ ay Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican &apos;s letter , a terrible re@@ por@@ ter , who covered the highest Bundes@@ minist@@ ries of a oil @-@ magn@@ ates that were over@@ occupied by his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; me it was , as if that is the absolute truth , it all is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only reinforced . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting , that you are always that you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very warmer love of love about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he goes with his bott@@ len@@ eck .
&quot; he never keeps on the mountain behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague expressed it , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him in favor of him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million voices that he won at the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number that nomin@@ ee a nomin@@ ee of the party . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ ot person I asked me ?
I was able to reconc@@ ile up Tru@@ mp and his voters to reconc@@ ile his voters in Phoenix for my time .
&quot; for example , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of Journ@@ alism Programme , which took people from all over the world , a deeply sad@@ ness that I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the Tru@@ mp@@ s World illustr@@ ates not with the Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met us in our common love for basketball , and we spent a lot of hours to watch the &quot; &quot; Phoenix First &quot; &quot; in play . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I lived with Sandy B@@ ahr , who lived their lives long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as her son . &quot;
&quot; she fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Capp@@ es , who always fits with a lot of patience and grace , and helped me to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there was Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and those affected by them are deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while the Tru@@ mp has set his way to the nom@@ ination of Republi@@ can presidential data , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part of his restricted vision of America . &quot;
however it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly wives , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against not @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people have voted for Tru@@ mp , because they have either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , because they were prepared to over@@ look these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp &apos;s voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange people , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
that is super@@ ficial and respectful and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters have been voted for Tru@@ mp , because they would like to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick to raise the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look differently from it . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( m. ) . : so much as &quot; &quot; el@@ ong@@ ation of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; , &quot; wor@@ ship@@ ing from white in references to the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash as it was the great Van Jones , has exactly been killed that America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it &apos;s nonetheless a powerful idea - what belief or background you like , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the election Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white America of America and says : to hell with mani@@ fol@@ dness , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the Ru@@ der , say it . &quot;
&quot; all of whom I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton had Mr. Khan had a change of change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud @-@ strong &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; bro@@ ods the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ri@@ ef@@ en they and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; if someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a sing@@ ular and lau@@ ght &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words , &quot; God is thanks to Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was fallen , sent it a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s country , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people , which look like Mr. Khan , could not find place in this new America . &quot;
and that leaves me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
&quot; the music that is played in both places , not only the lives of the children is changing , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) in the municipality : one of children and adults @-@ founded sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a way to overcome the re@@ movable poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , which is one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drugs abuse and the gangs . &quot;
but this changed this after an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pil@@ ots who started a musical project and offered the youth so a rare hop@@ eless@@ ly thought .
the young band members take their obligations to the musical group very seriously , means the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come and play with gl@@ os@@ sy eyes and play in the bu@@ zz you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ong@@ os , and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically located on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay capital - on instruments that are made from recur@@ rent waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re @-@ prepared instruments , which consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the Rec@@ ycl@@ er led by F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez thus began to turn parts of the case in instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ i@@ fy ho@@ stages , viol@@ as , c@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , guit@@ ars , fl@@ utes , trumpet , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion , which were all produced from the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ish and Latin American music and music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local ec@@ ologist and a musician for the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , to the early days : &quot;
&quot; first of all , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something has been shown before had never seen before : one out of waste .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra , which plays on instruments made of re @-@ prepared material and called The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical performance to :
the world generates about 1 billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who are living with him and of him are the poorest - as men in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can be successfully able to fight against illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fought the wil@@ de illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re @-@ release happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the sharing of content .
&quot; in West Africa , then it was known that this ship had already been operated in liber@@ ated waters of illegal fishing fishing , before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly brought up in this way and little incl@@ ined to welcome a criminal crus@@ her of this kind in its co@@ asts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ors , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised himself quickly against the ship . they refuse to share one of their ports and refuse to share him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply ling@@ ered everything , &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leit@@ ner of the Ken@@ yan @-@ fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , due to lo@@ oting of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing ( Ill@@ eg@@ ale fisheries stop ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that were exp@@ elled from their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it is about illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden , why it is extremely difficult to get up . thus , the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing from regions . &quot;
&quot; inten@@ tional abuse of existing laws , through which certain habitats and types are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm a delicate equilibrium . &quot;
&quot; but while action against illegal fishing was once more hin@@ dered by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ dles and also by the sn@@ ail , with the information between individual countries , so the actions happen nowadays in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries , for example , share lists of existing licenses , news on suspic@@ ious activities or details that can be noticed or experienced during a port of port . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive , if they move at the open seas , by satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to detect the authorities , ships that are fishing in har@@ ass@@ ed areas . there are so di@@ spar@@ ed driving routes , such that a ship charges the fish along the way on other ships . &quot;
&quot; ide@@ al@@ diar@@ rhe@@ a may show such investigations , whether the ships involved have a broad license , where they were on the move and possibly whether they have a pen@@ ance register . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , can refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports . what means that the ships will not sell their charge . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner , meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leit@@ ner director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the mentioned platform was created to attract more than 20 million USD ( previous sales ) , which lose the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i each year due to the illegal fishermen that enter into East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una @-@ fish to attract the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also these illegal fishermen .
&quot; among other practices include actions , such as the sailing of false flag , f@@ ake lic@@ ting p@@ api@@ ers , specification of ph@@ antasi@@ es , fishing , protected species and the fish in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they are target@@ ing the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ consistent control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; previously , a ship could have illeg@@ ally fish and a country could then say &apos; You did not stop my harbour . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &apos; and this legal ha@@ ch tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ ects ships .
it has exposed criminal networks distributed in Tanzania the f@@ ake licenses used in Tanzania . it discovered ships that have been pursued multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found it vol@@ ved ships .
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ POL , the international authorities to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i information is able to share information on illegal fishing over big distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system , which is to help the ISH @-@ i to di@@ gest p@@ add@@ est ships of precise . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite staff , which is always further developed , also helps to hide the illegal ships that are like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Editor @-@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an NGO which also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be registered by satellite . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects various information levels with each other . it aims at ISH @-@ i to help crimin@@ ally ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model @-@ program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence the global issue of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch , the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that can satellite reception data and by which the position of each single trac@@ eable ship can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join forces with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - that is simply sense , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bund@@ le their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; p@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts have a similar project to run , in which a global system the persecution of ships are permitted . &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als but they can also be deter@@ red .
&quot; ships that used earlier without licence , and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they will be observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in the meantime a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats for more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia that had helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the spec@@ tors found there on board strap , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice this success . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa annually disappear several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries joined together in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also , they now fight against illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; the aim is to create more such initiatives and structures also in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member states had his first big triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was travelling under fal@@ sely flag . and not just was the ship used without a license and were called Tu@@ epp@@ nets that are now banned . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into deser@@ ted waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures to Gre@@ ko 1 put a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a particular , collaborative way of protection for the protection of the oceans actually works in the whole cosmos .

they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum to counter the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Government of Venezuela had rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum to the Am@@ t@@ sen@@ ti@@ bles@@ hooting , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans had the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country into emp@@ tin@@ ent when they gathered on the streets . &quot;
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both by these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also managed in other parts of the country , among others in the bor@@ derland Bar@@ inas , located in the district of MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central part of the Bundestag Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by a acute lack of food and medicine . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw in the uph@@ e@@ av@@ al of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change ; but ultimately , the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;

especially large waves hit the message about polished oppression in the central north @-@ northern city of Marac@@ ay .
&quot; there the demonstr@@ ators went back into the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and armed prop@@ on@@ ents of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators were trying to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ state T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not carry skir@@ ts , because one could see something like many nation@@ alists ! &quot;
meanwhile it is already a info@@ graphics round that forms the scale of oppression per day :
so the dictatorship changed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a bai@@ li@@ ff procedure - this has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many countless people on the streets .

the interview was translated into English and will be published with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father , the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the Province of CÃ³rdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano does not have a look for his life .
&quot; starting with the brush , the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military per@@ ations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he insi@@ sted the surname for itself .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that was fine . &quot;
I felt like a sal@@ ent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one did not notice that you can manipul@@ ate from his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not recognize that my father was a th@@ ief , let , and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ pover@@ ished . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , was the father of 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities which he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a federal Court to his own father . &quot;
his story shows which great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose a path of salvation .

I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called for me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
&quot; you are a Ar@@ sch@@ lo@@ ch , you are friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
passport only in that they will not kidn@@ ap you one day and I have to save you .
the Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo - revolution@@ aries People &apos;s army - the military arm of the revolution@@ aries in Argentina .
&quot; therefore , he offered me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would be obe@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought , that would be ok . for so my father had moved me . &quot;
on the military base I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , Prop@@ ag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da dr@@ ush the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
&quot; my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la , all in 1976 . &quot;
&quot; during the first time and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he command@@ ed me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just all possible - were . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little bit of wr@@ aps and command@@ ed me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a great l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen objects were put off and taught me with an increase .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I sh@@ ew into and saw a pen , which were tor@@ tured on the human being . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that she attached to the one end of a cabinet . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captiv@@ ated there .
&quot; they captiv@@ ated a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , betra@@ yed him with water and said to him a cargo from 220 Volt to the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was dr@@ unk there ... like a dirty win@@ dle .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately again and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; and I asked myself , how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from one another ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and have been tor@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the process ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a series of mat@@ tresses , in which naked people were captiv@@ ated with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated on hands and feet . &quot;
very close to the entrance of the entrance to the mat@@ tresses .
&quot; when my father arose , that I saw to the prisoner , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ le thou then , Ar@@ sch@@ lo@@ ch ? &quot;
&quot; I was blessed , Why did you otherwise brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there brought a man to a man and sl@@ ew .
&quot; ( according to survi@@ vor@@ s of the civil war Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial , the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;

&quot; the way that you came here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the map , see that they took about this route and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here its names have been changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of dem@@ ag@@ grandi@@ ose .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the top came to be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war &apos; power &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things coming home .
&quot; at that time in the age I had no idea what was &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as they knew it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later on the military myself , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war crimes are a b@@ aj@@ on@@ et or perhaps military sign , which one sees a enemy which one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothing , paintings , money ... sti@@ r , then this is not a war principle but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , in which v@@ and@@ alism could participate . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it simply .
&quot; I was also officers in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to inv@@ ade , into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do it .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I rep@@ lied , and thou that you sti@@ r cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in front of W@@ ut , struck me and cri@@ ed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and move yourself . &quot;
we do not need any other !
that was my father .
I have not only a good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time when I carried out a jack@@ et and a sco@@ oters of w@@ ool . both of them had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time the defence , a co @-@ conspir@@ ators had been with this crime . I res@@ sed , no problem , they can put me to the burden what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to testi@@ fy .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearances of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , when I am older , I feel rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one has only one children , we recognize the value of a life . &quot;
&quot; one develops and real@@ ises , that it is wrong to kill . &quot;
I was even so far to say :
&quot; well , you do have ex@@ hal@@ ted during the dictatorship . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children perform ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have done them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
&quot; had these people not even families , which could be given their mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants ? &quot;
the dis@@ appearances of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that you can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me , when democracy was introduced again , they took machines to eliminate the dying rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were sh@@ attered , and somewhere dispos@@ ed - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed men ! &apos;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crime - including my Father .
&quot; the thought , of my father , was created during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him har@@ ness because of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience with him . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I do not know . I did not have anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked me what the whole survi@@ ving patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they supposedly defended , actually good . &quot;
then I sh@@ ou@@ ted :
how can you tell us what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed men !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
he defeated only &quot; Na then put me on . &quot;
this is what I did .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto too &quot; terrible cars &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto in which one can extend its leadership .
the photo was spread in social media .
editing of the original pictures of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers were invited to a newly opened center in which one can extend its leadership style , in the last month witnesses of a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; in a shield the Japanese word was bl@@ ew , and the &quot; older car drivers &quot; means , mis@@ understand@@ ably , but may also be translated with mal@@ icious rear &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as a &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was available on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
editing of the original pictures of Joshua Lev@@ ine that was often shared in social media .
&quot; the error was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ oto . he also was , who made the local time to draw attention . &quot;
the Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; ) was later replaced by the more accurate , if gram@@ mati@@ cally is not completely correct term &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older car drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto exc@@ used for the translation error . furthermore , they explained that the bug has already been included in the text and that the translation has not been checked for correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the excuse :
&quot; we sincerely sorry that older people felt by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) made on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat down somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older car drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; fur@@ ry &quot; has been im@@ min@@ ated as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police there is the share of older drivers , which are nation@@ alized in accidents , but certainly cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto , for example , was caused in the year 2005 1,9@@ 41 from a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of seniors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 has caused by a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , their share rose to 17,@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of seniors has caused accidents in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the Repor@@ ter was not named in the Yahoo published version of the article comments to the Light , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seems to he@@ ed against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo on the translation error received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; ) about not the reality ?
- &quot; How faul@@ ty is the translation actually not , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error .
there are not very few such comments .
why En@@ gr@@ ish is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true finding @-@ gru@@ dge for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to use , you need two important skills : passive safety skills to understand the starting @-@ text and use active language skills to transfer him into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with mother lingu@@ ists . in general , the conviction that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - do not be in the pron@@ unci@@ ation of mother@@ language . &quot;
&quot; thus , a French mother tongue , for example , should be translated from English to French - not from the French to English . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on
&quot; many Japanese companies employ no employees with English as a mother tongue to produce translations into English . this may result in a lack of understanding of survival , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers , to learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that even do not have foreign employees , have translated translation into the company . then , the Japanese employee , whose English skills are made as the best one transl@@ ator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ enen and en@@ ig@@ matic movements are created by machine translations that this technique can not replace any human transl@@ ator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , who often decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or least harmless . however , from large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards can be expected . &quot;
the City of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and ur@@ ging measures on the Internet and television take up
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Frei@@ es surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , on the 7th of April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet user does not have access to the online transm@@ itter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet pres@@ ences of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other on @-@ channels super@@ se@@ ated recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that res@@ ists themselves by the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court opened the Parliament and had the responsibilities of the Parliament to the executive , and the Supreme Court to himself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is known , and recommended the users , VP@@ N ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VP@@ N .
it seems that Internet site Venezu@@ el@@ an provider are again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in periods of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , traditional media has been involved in reporting about protests . at that time , the Commission for telecommunications to them with fin@@ es and closing , if they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than two lit@@ res Lim@@ on@@ ade to buy .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay has been in@@ accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNA ) , but also two other on @-@ channel stations . this also concerns the website , on which the national meeting con@@ es its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous rep@@ lic@@ tions of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had indicated that the local Internet provider may refuse DNS service . this is a technique , by which the DNA servers of certain domains has failed . &quot;
&quot; when a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or denied the request when calling for such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third ges@@ ted channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , 6th of April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV @-@ Cam@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried live the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;

&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government is regul@@ ates the internet connections : hence the Venezu@@ el@@ ans will always be further complicated with access to multi@@ medi@@ al coverage on current events in the country . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report of bat , which will be published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Flying cows , decre@@ asing schools &quot; ) , edited and released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , where she did not live together with the family who lived there . &quot;
&quot; just before her graduation at the university she returned to the house again and heard , as the owner of the house was full of pride about it . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; who has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ min@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , in Paraguay that is forced to work more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money passes their inf@@ eri@@ or son or her min@@ der@@ old daughter to another , rich family . in exchange the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children must afford to do countless days of household work , who can never be paid and victims of abuse and ab@@ uses - and all this as part of a contract that cannot be up@@ lift . &quot;
&quot; this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice in Paraguay , based on participation and acceptance by large sections of society , and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ enga worked for a few years for an organization responsible for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas , especially young girls - primarily affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered @-@ witnesses , researched and p@@ ran@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things when name , because the feeling of gratitude , which is char@@ geable to Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family that her daughter is in faith that they will conclude that their education will complete their position in society and make &quot; something from themselves &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who acqu@@ ires the girl with himself and justi@@ fies its exploitation by faith that would give someone a chance that would otherwise be no training , and perhaps even star@@ ve . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mis@@ used , his family will only experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes it is never experienced .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic hous@@ ings , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of intense blo@@ ws . just after it died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ min@@ ita in the household of the former Military Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra , and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official in the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants and 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra suffered as long as with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until it suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic society prov@@ oked practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s death .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as a modern form of slavery .
several dozen people came to protest@@ ations together and demanded that there is no other Carolina . &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered than children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to harm the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a timely investigation on the case .
&quot; they want the Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , which was sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n might be a landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go occurs . &quot;
the daily life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas will not only be exploited as labour force ; they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when the farmer , where her father worked , bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy had to register and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; your brothers must now all work and began to sell on the street or on the market sweets , to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita into the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ enga worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time to learn that you still have time for learning . &quot;
it stood on every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , they clean@@ se the fridge , pl@@ aster the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground . &quot;
when the school was at the end she went back home and had time to learn .
&quot; the sooner they were finished with learning , the more free time had it . &quot;
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga says , she had never had to star@@ ve , but did not get un@@ bound@@ ed food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the refrigerator , &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ er of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; to some gradu@@ ates of the Al@@ var@@ enga , next to him stand and editorial from Op@@ position@@ ings such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to convince the reports of the official media using the dict@@ ator of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but he did not hold her with her . &quot; &quot; the hous@@ eholder had found someone who spoke , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would learn there again &quot; bad habit . &quot; that said they said that Al@@ var@@ enga is to speak to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , which would speak their native Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;

&quot; hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter , who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her . &quot;

the ad was given five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a miserable girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered their 15 @-@ year @-@ old n@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the inland , which would like to work . &quot;

leg@@ alism writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain C@@ C@@ 0 .
&quot; sixty Egyptian parliament ordered recently adopted a bill to &quot; &quot; regul@@ ators &quot; &quot; on the usage and utility of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if he is believed by the Parliament , user and users must register social media in Egypt with a government office to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law a job would then be set up , which is asked to give citizens a permission to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users would need to register for user resources and users on the site with their proper names and personnel numbers , to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it failed to do so , this could be a sentence of up to six months in det@@ ention or a money . &quot;
&quot; the bill introduced , consisting of six Par@@ agr@@ arians and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de Application , which is running through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video axis and text . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is adopted , since the draft is no reference to how Egyptian authorities should decide to account users who do not register for the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdu@@ l Satt@@ ar , parliament of parliament and sponsors of the Legisl@@ ative Law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user name and users received from the telecommunic@@ ation Ministry of username and a password to come across by the fire@@ wall , Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; that could mean that Egypt is planning to be a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of which , it would be necessary for Egypt &apos;s interior and Egyptians to access the network . &quot;
&quot; but so far , it is not known that such plans exist . &quot;
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leit@@ ner expl@@ or@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in English &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I have doubts about the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things which have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , it is so that as they do a vast public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take them seriously , that means they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens that claim a permit or not . and this means a mani@@ ac system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative and constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his assumption and enforcement is successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military ment@@ ality in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and safegu@@ ar@@ ded that no devi@@ ation scar@@ ce on the surface is present , says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year the parliament of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy proposed a legislative action against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long det@@ ention for those provided to thre@@ aten the public order and &quot; &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the northeast of the Ir@@ aks work the Ti@@ ersch@@ utz@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization of Nature to protect the spiritual leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of leop@@ ards that ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are getting less pre@@ y . &quot;
why is this certain kind of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza gets in the video , the Persian Leopard the only remaining smoking in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem is also dependent on that there is a large rob@@ bery . &quot;
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards actually in the free hunting season is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore represents that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera all that leaves R@@ aza in a joy .
&quot; as a trained Biolog@@ o , R@@ aza passion@@ ately is passionate about another side of their country , not only from war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in trials studies to wild animals and to educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 , the British Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o has been achieved to rebuild the lives of those who have been affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a vast earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima have triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung is located in Send@@ ai , which is in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was one of the busi@@ est pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan @-@ east , who had to experience both the earthqu@@ akes and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ads were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had all the coastal cities disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lived a nuclear accident , so alone that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report from the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress made for six years afterwards to re @-@ establish the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re @-@ building authorities as well as pol@@ l results of those affected by themselves .
&quot; the apartment location in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned sub@@ stitutes , co@@ f@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) have been completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures could draw Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; Iw@@ ate has 75 per cent of such houses completed , whereas at Fu@@ kus@@ hima and 70 percent form the balance . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one still makes every effort to reach even six years after the catastrophe , evac@@ u@@ ated of containers accommodation ( c@@ res@@ hip , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final replacement parts . &quot;
&quot; after the triple disaster , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in containers accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , still 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iv@@ ory in such containers . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of 2011 evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency accommodation , while staying more successful in Not@@ ici@@ ag@@ i . more than 75 percent of the evac@@ u@@ ate who lived after the disaster in containers accommodation , were res@@ ett@@ led to final houses . &quot;
&quot; for Iv@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent . &quot;
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; to determine how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Newspaper have been able to have 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by un@@ lucky , its doors to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures are far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 percent of fishing har@@ bors in Iv@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been in operation again , have resum@@ ed up 30 percent of the fishing town in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atom@@ are accident , have moved in the three pre@@ fecture of the agr@@ arian agricultural land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , whereby only 66 percent of the och@@ re economy can be used in Iv@@ onne and less than 50 percent of destru@@ c@@ tible in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear un@@ failing , because only 690 hectares of about 5 400 hectares of destroyed A@@ cker@@ el &apos;s land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are in the &quot; &quot; nuclear waste &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fecture , tourism has recovered and recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains cr@@ ammed . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ate are back to 90 percent at the same level , as before evil . Fu@@ kus@@ hima on the other hand , can only be 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it &apos;s more difficult to feel to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods . &quot;
is the native population ready for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the indigenous people and among the evac@@ u@@ ate . they asked them about the state of re@@ building and also how their reception can be altered compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in its introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey by bringing more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the indigenous people in experience .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention has been done . &quot;
as it stands for those who had to evac@@ u@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima
&quot; in her edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung increased its attention also to the position of evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima also was witness of the worst , disasters caused , atomic disorder in Japan . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved in areas outside the pre@@ fecture of the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were a bit more than 23 000 people , returned to Fu@@ kus@@ hima in lasting spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the booth of 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live outside their homeland pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astroph@@ es , most of the evac@@ u@@ ates who still have to return in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ rates , over 50 years of age . they have to return to real estate projects , Iw@@ ates and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo . &quot;

&quot; after a while , one often recogni@@ zes that a more un@@ brid@@ ged than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to extend our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look forward to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat subjects that often get less attention in the coverage than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday he had fought a police officers during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nation@@ wide took millions of demonstr@@ ators in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva Tarok the social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a sk@@ ull deer her@@ nia and several fr@@ actions . &quot;
doctors carried him this Saturday and now took him into an artificial chest .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which quickly spread within Brazil within a few days .
&quot; the face of the police have also identified the face of the police attack , which has been identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; following the incident , the police force in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s were known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o has been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation in the incident , of an active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer like he saw in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; if a police would stand out by a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care station , his face would see six months on television , and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel by media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several par@@ ame@@ works briefly on it to him . &quot;
another video with the same scenes but from another perspective is also filmed in social networks .
in the following clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus at the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users now have 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal attacks against demonstr@@ ators in the last Friday . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ emen continued in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber @-@ stories and ben@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via l@@ oud@@ speakers to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ esters got lost by focusing on another , un@@ expected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window of window . &quot;
Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo directly reported a bro@@ min@@ k glass window to make illustrations in with a photo of their front pages .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set in a fire set by bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic basis , more about a broken window as about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause . &quot;
you have to recognize even if you are strictly against any form of atomic damage .
&quot; also here the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is about absurd , dis@@ proportionate effect , and the typical atro@@ cities of the military police are dec@@ eived by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on Constitu@@ tions &quot; with the Police . &quot;
the fleet forgotten by the Un@@ indu@@ str@@ alization forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso nearly hundreds of sugar mills in Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; Greg@@ ory de Greg@@ orio Ar@@ row@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of what there is no n@@ able sugar@@ s on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities were laid in the sugar mills .
&quot; the sugar industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations , until only the ru@@ mor of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to find themselves new .
some are rarely the work .
&quot; other res@@ trained and s@@ add@@ ling daily to the factories , which still prevail . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which is open every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar industry do not smoke his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar mills in the east of the region , after a long in@@ active time , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expected .
N@@ ene is remin@@ is@@ cent of that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar factory but the promise has not been held .
&quot; the sugar@@ s are already resist@@ ing the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effic@@ ien@@ cies , the bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production was reduced by 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the land a few decades ago , but the bad har@@ vesting have already been no news . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar @-@ industry switched off ?
the old rail sti@@ ff of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane brand@@ y were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to concentrate the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons . &quot;
they left only the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the motives , that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations , and the Zu@@ ck@@ le crisis on the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar@@ s rose before about a decade back . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound remain , according to the 2016 published report &quot; &quot; agricultural &quot; &quot; of the OECD and FAO , agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the pipe exports would be invested around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the day of today will come into history with certainty , that were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from there on the process of restructuring started in the sugar industry .
&quot; in the following years , the stagn@@ ation of a total of 98 sweet@@ meats , more than 65 million persons received their full sal@@ aries for training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as soldier , talking about the closing of the factory , is the word he most repeatedly , &quot; &quot; fraud &quot; . &quot; &quot;
almost all surveys have the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be breast@@ feeding .
&quot; so that the place is received , they formed a full @-@ time - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first next year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recorded documents that would only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could use any decrease . &quot;
&quot; from there on , the responsibility was out@@ going and the letters were increasingly more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of two years for the nursing factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the production yet in operation .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility that Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will in the lac@@ tation of the factory , in which it helped build them . &quot;
&quot; with any part , that he removed , dismant@@ led one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
Cuba is the best developed industrial area between Cuba and the most important job producer .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives have been made for work and services , which generated the plants into the communities in which they were found . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present people saw , when he was guaranteed for the areas whose factories would no longer run into operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for closing the sugar base
since 2004 the sugar@@ can@@ ter will be extrac@@ ted only high by m@@ illing .

&quot; after two years the People @-@ Commun@@ es Greg@@ ory Ar@@ row@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ I learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar factory closed , or better said than they began to med@@ itate them , they also heard on to asp@@ hal@@ ting the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
you have been to spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the care of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new system are still impos@@ ing .

first Nations young people use Hip Hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture

&quot; young people of the First Nations communities in Canada deal with themes that are important for them . they do it with Hip Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , for 2014 Work@@ shop@@ pers mobile studios directly to schools and youth centers , to teach youth groups Song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances . &quot;
the original workshops were directed by the Ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges that lives in Montreal and lived in North @-@ Quebec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked together with the C@@ ree Hip Hop Group The North@@ Stars .
&quot; the workshop is increasing for the young participants in discussions such as &quot; cultural identity , language , discussion , love , self acceptance or whatever comes in mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the kite cal@@ end@@ um First nation in British Columbia , is also called the Highway from the tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First nation uses the motif of a video player , to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite influences by globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people have not always master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First nation was shot , the chor@@ us is sung to C@@ ree . &quot;
the young people involved here were a little help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop Group who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree lie@@ h .
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is available the St@@ rop@@ he in Tran@@ scription , as well as translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like anyone would ever be interested in me
but I try to walk my days on earth
&quot; that is the day , where you will take our cry &quot;
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe we will rise up a day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live in bad life
so they can grow and lead to our youth as well
&quot; in this way , they can do what they are appointed to the Creator . &quot;
in the commentary box the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also has a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ scription ( which will also be published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
plastic meals are shown in Japan not only in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( c@@ res@@ c@@ um ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see almost any restaurant sculp@@ tural dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers , what exactly is on the menu , are exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( can@@ als , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic models of dishes &quot; ) of each dish served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to making these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Sofia borough of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small companies that produce even those plastic dishes , who documented the German fil@@ mm@@ akers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese people , these plastic dishes usually tend to re@@ fresh them . however , a new trend is however turned into con@@ spic@@ uous phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; by Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ dos san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic containers decor@@ ate mobile phones , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ sch@@ y collective , as in this case , cool@@ ant mag@@ net : &quot;
here are a few cool refriger@@ ators for a new show at the Tokyo station .
the new boom of eating is increasingly complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular town@@ s@@ cured with seafood ) turned into a cell phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a cell phone .
we have also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that ret@@ ains your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to see like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing pl@@ ough .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own art work . in this case i@@ cur@@ a or salmon che@@ ated , a popular T@@ opping which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can dec@@ eived my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will probably be the only .
&quot; this interest in plastic courts can also accept a less appe@@ als form , to surprise for instance colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile @-@ stand is the form of mel@@ ting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also irrit@@ ations ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ tre@@ adm@@ ills of dried black salmon . &quot;
further sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the has@@ ht@@ ag # C@@ astr@@ on to become bor@@ row .
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of these trends , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the popularity of the restaurant industry . such as sho@@ ku@@ dos san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers , &quot;

&quot; in reports in reports and foreign media on the &quot; &quot; struggle against Drug Trade &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the inter@@ ni@@ sts and s@@ lic@@ ates regularly emerge only in statistics . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy against this struggle . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ells , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict totally in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , there is hardly anyone looking at the grape or the commun@@ es who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , behind every body , behind each bone was discovered in the hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wo@@ unds might never cure . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico is the digital project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ens@@ a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with drug wholesale &quot; &quot; ) to give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories of people who gr@@ ated the struggle between criminal enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime cannot be fear about our lives .
the impact is much more profound .
&quot; for example , if business close , because they are threatened by drugs retailers and whole churches therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is in each weekend secret tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , which in just one day lost her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the task that we have put forward , go and go to gra@@ ves , according to the people whom we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but they do not get paid out , because that require a death @-@ certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are to be afraid of . we must show the international community the conflicts , the break and the government . &quot;
the project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high risk @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that there should never be seen as normal , regardless of what forms it occurs : &quot;
disease and Sens@@ ation@@ journ@@ alism I have been familiar with for some years now .
I come over every day at times of time and see the cover pages with pictures that can actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes , I feel as if I am the only thing that sho@@ ok or sad . it acts like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body once belonged . &quot;
I cannot be in@@ different at this time or regard this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks that he is big ( German : drug dealers ) will be that he is great . and it is also not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders , if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me that is , as if they were those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they may happen . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories are to blo@@ wn numbers in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is incredible to me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students are justified in a neighboring village that they were &quot; revol@@ ved . &quot;
I think they are trying to speak that they are spar@@ ed by such trag@@ e@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Haupt@@ stadt@@ distri@@ butions : like a family with dr@@ ones , it describes how armed crimin@@ als had been destroyed by their business till they ended up not only the business but also their family apart . &quot;
&quot; you think of everything you lost , and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; the ache on it never goes , the trau@@ ma will remain , the fear comes back high once you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed - phone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed , the better . &quot;
it included their report with words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you do not know when they will guide you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether wines would solve my deep @-@ root feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how you cri@@ es . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of the violence marked by force . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction he raises questions on how : who cares about the child of a missed woman and a man , who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
what is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
br@@ yan is a Li@@ ise and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make a egg coo@@ ks which makes Tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies which is with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ ags with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year &apos;s life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been over two years before , when he was just a few blocks from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father saw that shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
as Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mor@@ nings according to the public safety and government of the United States government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ utor of the 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds in the inc@@ ision 8,5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
&quot; these are just a few of thousands of thousands of stories , that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade it into the soul of the country . &quot;
few stories still live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those that we must not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ens@@ a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to portr@@ ayed the complex information behind the failed fight against drugs that has been tor@@ mented by the country over the past four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flick@@ r @-@ Users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ ARN@@ ING : this post and the pages that it linked , involve images , on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift up a ru@@ mor or for@@ gery .
&quot; but what is the years after something the first appeared ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been used to report trag@@ e@@ dies which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupl@@ ing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dr@@ aft News - deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a petrol trucks in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo , ki@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life . &quot;
after the civil war of Africa the two largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths that were difficult to sail .
trag@@ ically under@@ carriage fell victim to the victim .
&quot; official representatives described a fire@@ ball , the du@@ ous houses covered including a cin@@ emas in the vicinity , which was full of people who vi@@ vi@@ dly vi@@ dly believe the football World Championship . &quot;
houses displ@@ aced and shor@@ tened cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ mistak@@ able .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User My@@ stic Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015 Multi @-@ gr@@ ading photographs of the incident , the gr@@ aci@@ ous scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows ranks of the fo@@ al body that suits on the ground up while people are looking at it .
but here history does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been raised several times in social media , blogs and other platforms and may not be attributed to real trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what was not happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of the Bok@@ o Har@@ am of the Nig@@ erian villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
eye @-@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically by atro@@ cities that they had to fl@@ ee .
houses and shops have been burnt down and sur@@ names were used in streets and cer@@ eals .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; nobody was left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a citizen on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were sm@@ elled , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up could be represented . &quot;
&quot; the occasion for the attack was also uns@@ ol@@ ved , but the army level in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of Bok@@ o Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture emerged from the Democratic Republic of Congo again , as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous use of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo has only been documented in a series of failure ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was reported as a cover for mass@@ acres .
&quot; yet another step further brings personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange joined in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash registration , published by the United Nations , the fl@@ ee could fl@@ ee , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts , as the following , which brought this description with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab News page , which was mist@@ aken by President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Being , mon@@ ks and politicians would have participated in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she used the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo to submit this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , which AF@@ P had known as their source , had also un@@ mistak@@ enly believe this statement , but had not associated the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo . &quot;
the world wide range of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere around the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; reverse image &quot; &quot; you can see how far more information can exceed borders . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ returned picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( date of 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures found , which are very similar to the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mix@@ er private pages , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed false reports distributed , others try to un@@ f@@ eit@@ ing the f@@ eit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; we have received examples of the ab@@ used usage and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they had been published . by doing so , we want to become more evident than by language alone . &quot;

here are some cases that can now be split up now ( on the map in Orange ) :

&quot; this article from 2014 about students who were released by the Bok@@ o Har@@ am , published by the Catholic news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly explained that the image does not come from the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar ste@@ ak attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later came in connection with the mass@@ acre of the Bok@@ o Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ ery@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ ph@@ ya@@ ho@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo has emerged , provided with this T@@ witter@@ has@@ ht@@ ag , and delet@@ es a discussion under Muslims according to the mass@@ acre of Bok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities were taking these events , the mut@@ in@@ ex@@ ual in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was rep@@ lic@@ ated as proof of the mass@@ acre of the Bok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 . but the messages that were connected there@@ with , were raised in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to focus attention to the relative number of the dead and one comparison of the media reporting , compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Tunisi@@ an ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message which supposedly was written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , in circulation , we translated discussion boards like this here on Vietnam@@ ese and said it to the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo were included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; on other accounts , ag@@ greg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , ink has also been completely trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / dates exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and for@@ ks them via images in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original income of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or appro@@ achable . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( impressions ) that under@@ go this po@@ sts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in terms of greater discussions about the silence in connection with the trials of Christians through Muslim or - for the defence of Muslims - the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second frame uses the picture to discuss how a African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot give this pictures longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who have acci@@ dentally obtained water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; I suggest that the mood of the failed and fal@@ seh@@ ood , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and decor@@ ates it the real Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the dissem@@ ination of rap@@ tured images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the return of images of a ref@@ us@@ al deri@@ ves to recognise the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even required by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that for@@ ci@@ ble pictures readers and viewers des@@ en@@ si@@ bilities and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study that examined , how for@@ ci@@ ble media act on it , others to help ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to be discussed with regard to violent accounts in the news media , the fact that it is indispensable for today &apos;s news report . &quot;
&quot; technical experim@@ entation is experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will have to think thorough about situations where a picture may be in@@ duced , which actually may be dis@@ solved by context or completely mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous type . &quot;
but any investigation is false prescri@@ ptions should also be considered as internationally they can be .

the &quot; un@@ transl@@ atable blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses according to CC BY @-@ N@@ D 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ tran@@ scrip@@ ture ( e.g. insur@@ mount@@ able ) attempts to provide language inspiring a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these unver@@ i@@ able words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ esa ) .
but all res@@ stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly each attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; one word or expression is not enough , why a complete statement and sometimes a little context is required to accurately understand what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have already been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; &quot; transl@@ atable &quot; &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u as follows :
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Take your parents in recognition of how you have tried yourself in your younger years .
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil like : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after having been heated to cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they de@@ cryp@@ t other cultures , reve@@ aling other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our re@@ gi@@ er@@ de . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how to analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site , and show more of this &quot; un@@ bund@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;

how Sri Lanka ends with the worst flav@@ our disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst high @-@ water and ground@@ breaking disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by mon@@ soon , which usually ends in late May , are due to strong ra@@ inf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ t@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the shore . &quot;
&quot; according to an opinion of the disaster of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of hundred are missing because of the floods and sw@@ amm@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe place of stay . &quot;
&quot; the ra@@ inf@@ all took place on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas went back slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene @-@ relationships of the population represents a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the floo@@ d@@ disaster disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .

&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in the flood water , water up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da during G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the be@@ aten wat@@ erg@@ y@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
air force has five aircraft available for b@@ ail@@ out actions and further five are made available for transport of emergency supplies to the indigenous villages included in their floo@@ ded villages .
also various organizations and start @-@ ups have been prepared to help .
Facebook @-@ Pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water conditions and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue operations dr@@ ones need for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for anyone who want to don@@ ate the dry foods and vital goods for high water @-@ offering -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
&quot; tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) ask for people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ aly@@ tic centre will be notified . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ crash Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; high water aid &quot; &quot; button that allowed it to call a vehicle for picking up from assistance and donations . these were then passed on for free to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ c@@ ite R@@ ote cross . &quot;
&quot; they also brought a &quot; &quot; SOS &quot; &quot; key that had more than thousand requests and 150 successful bo@@ at@@ ters for a result of high water and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , they bring residents in need in security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
use hem@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighboring in and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , they famili@@ arize me with their children ; she is my rock in the Brand@@ ing . &quot;
in one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ andi@@ ze we are right for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are located in a sea of rain forest and people , some keep the i@@ con@@ ical picture of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound by a US flag , other sk@@ andi@@ ze slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; these things concern not you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims , &quot; I ask myself . &quot;
I have already guided this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has established itself in their conception . &quot;
you mus@@ li@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be Muslim , in different kinds . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer is made in our collective idea , so good that as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit there , ent@@ mus@@ li@@ zed there . &quot;
mus@@ li@@ zing will be li@@ zed
I am not alone with that .
&quot; this is actually happened to the poet , whose poetry in America is best sold : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images come to one in the mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ ad Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a huge part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists of the reduced images of Muslims that have been coloni@@ zed by western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting imag@@ ery is determined by the dark man to fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid crus@@ hed the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures are still part of today .
&quot; our politicians , the news and Hollywood keep them continuing . &quot;
&quot; I have worked for three years in the news industry , and I have seen how this for@@ c@@ eful , incorrect Nar@@ r@@ ative our new@@ com@@ s are domin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women over the past three decades , while the USA was not even able to choose their first female presidential election . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are forced to carry her head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and exp@@ elled su@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover up their entire body that are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercise his &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens mus@@ cular women , which lead movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it looks beyond that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , which were brought together with slaves here . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this scar@@ let , our collective imagination has been so deep and l@@ acked , that often Si@@ kh Men and children become the destination of tim@@ ulative attacks and sh@@ allo@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; due to these stories that we tell , and due to the manner in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
belong to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
and my industry is amazing to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we are here that seven million Muslims have put together in the highest degree &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the whole Muslim population are African Americans .
six out of ten U.S. Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation from 77 countries .

use approved .
four decades ago my first parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother made her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrapers of New York . sky@@ scrapers were made possible through Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time when Khan thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ avoidable Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ le@@ aded Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes , when I wonder people , why I say no pig meat , I say - instead of my mus@@ cular recipes , or make my hand@@ craft pick@@ up that all Muslims bear in themselves - &quot; &quot; out of respect from P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I joke , we do not carry all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us . &quot;
&quot; we do not have to be a the@@ ological expert to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security ch@@ equ@@ es at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of prominent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists , who seek to fight far @-@ reaching lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies will be produced on the ongoing band from a well established Islamic hos@@ tilities , with money firms , Th@@ ink tanks and experts for mis@@ representation that is our already faul@@ ty appearance of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories that we tell , and because of the manner in which we tell them , there is Islam hos@@ tility to more than just a foreig@@ ner , which is a woman the head@@ scar@@ f . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but was born into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ tian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when soci@@ o@@ ists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my neighbour in the fire see that I am Muslims , if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our homes . &quot;
&quot; she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ous ritual with my daughter when I lie them in my arms , and her the Arab verses to protect the Quran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask for that it is protected from evil , evil that you can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; belonging to my grand@@ mother &apos;s grand@@ mother is with her sisters , as they gain a contest of the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi two decades ago . &quot;
&quot; it is the image of her that I see in this moment I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their full @-@ filled and un@@ finished paintings , a book with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters that can be almost intact . &quot;
&quot; Muslim is to be to speak the prayers that it had said to me , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; his Muslim is to be as she brought me to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that has been coloni@@ zed - over centuries - through a &quot; Empire &quot; , &quot; which has established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tic Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Komp@@ anie , has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my per@@ me@@ ander@@ ed grandfather wept . &quot;

&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians who have split their families , like with my grandfather , by coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
&quot; Muslim is to be aware that in the last two centuries , Europeans all have been coloni@@ zed all the way to four Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; it means to know , that the first fli@@ erb@@ om@@ b of history was cast over a Muslim country in front of a Muslim country . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indo , Kash@@ mir Unter@@ tan of the British empire , described from the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there was planes , he jour@@ ne@@ yed to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical Word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim strain of the 1.7 billion , we go back to our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ conc@@ il@@ able story . &quot;
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful army in the world , with troops being distributed over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tic , who have been distributed to chase weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that over half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried in the ruins of war .
an American Muslim Br@@ otherhood is to know that the self @-@ mor@@ ant among veter@@ ans have risen more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that if a tragedy comes from the US , and the susp@@ ects has a Muslim name , the history of four times more reported than a story with a white attacks . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four@@ teen years ago the first prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist , called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought into this land . &quot;
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X to the American hero .
&quot; it is the heat , which I sen@@ sed , when people were crowded with the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and if we say black life .
&quot; to be a Americans , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , the in@@ dur@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple ties , but to fail to send them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion holds more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; she . &quot;
&quot; to be a mother to be a mother to worry my child and all mus@@ cular children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build on this deu@@ ter@@ ness structural Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim govern@@ s , which started with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in tran@@ sit@@ ing monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it exists in the immigration office , which takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it exists in a country that closes its borders towards people from the countries , which bom@@ bed it . &quot;
it is a false and neb@@ ul@@ sive &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ list &quot; which largely Arabs and Muslims h@@ ates into the spot@@ light .
&quot; there are the wars , which we lead and the bom@@ bs we have in Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories that we tell , and due to those we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University showed a scientifically uncomfortable image and diplom@@ ats them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in the evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the sli@@ gh@@ test score .
con@@ vers@@ ations that we have to carry
&quot; we are too deep , to dismis@@ ze the Muslim or the &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have come back decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous imaging that we ste@@ ad@@ ite in our news . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our frequently with bin@@ s identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast lake Some@@ thing , S@@ ay Some@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video song Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ bert Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ lied mus@@ cular authors - all this makes me hope . &quot;

&quot; but I am worried due to this difficult global point of time , in which we are located . &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for the conspir@@ acies that existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now run the White House . &quot;
they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially , by providing the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a couple of years ago she had not existed her ; now they domin@@ ate great regions in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am worried about the realities and history , which I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who made me now an un@@ winding Muslims . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread@@ cru@@ m@@ track in my speech .
&quot; things that may wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that makes our humanity a story , where someone is made to a &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , consul@@ ations in the context of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; over a hundred acade@@ mies talk about our problems with the &quot; others &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , these are no terms with which we usually have in our schools for us or which we read in our newspapers . &quot;
poster of the Fac@@ ebook@@ ender page of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia Studies Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell us here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people were revealed by the creation of &quot; others &quot; in public perception , four decades even Scientific of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we must ask ourselves in@@ convenient questions about the role of what it is aware and un@@ consciously to galvan@@ ise the &quot; other , &quot; as it &apos;s my girlfriend and I saw a new future in which we have no president , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
it begins with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ l@@ art seeks to keep ur@@ ry diversity
&quot; stor@@ yt@@ ellers , of Flick@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , under the use of the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ N@@ D 2.0 . &quot;
can there be an opportunity here and now in spite of a language barrier to contact someone ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the number of stories in their original language a possible response . &quot;
&quot; Global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the im@@ edi@@ ble blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written words but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities . &quot;
&quot; indeed , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has been carried out since 2015 events , the risk that small and not completely so small languages do not be passed to the children there . &quot;
for the creators of the project :
&quot; mass die of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , embrace the diversity - safe spaces where people are not forgotten to go home . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listen often , often it is connected to understand &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; to appreciate . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers put their story first in their own language and translate them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and their representation are showing that the audience &apos;s listening to it . &quot;
they call Lau@@ ghter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou will also take the opportunity to explain typical customs of nar@@ rati@@ ves for their country . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the rock of rab@@ bits and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; after having declared the meaning of his beak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked to speak to a public that does not share your language ? &quot; with a wide stretch he will share his feeling of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling in three cities took place , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project may contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ elling performances . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US rev@@ ital@@ isation of sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a new check of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took part in 72 million US dollars , took part in a mass demonstration on the past 3 April 2017 , the march of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was proclaimed from the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the neur@@ ot@@ ation of debts ) and the O@@ kom@@ en@@ ian church meeting in Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the FÃ¼r@@ th of the debt recovery have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos calls for the politicians , ben@@ ches and government agencies responsible for debts to be held responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial examination and a Committee on public debt without personal interest in public debt , with a permanent , our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pres@@ pressed and suppres@@ sed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not its .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king deposits .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not into the state @-@ establishment of an integrated territory of the US - is suffering from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; is propos@@ ing a non @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization without a focus on the socio @-@ economic development , a law on responsibility for government responsibility , as an alternative to existing state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a broad restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; from the outside , measures will be imposed without the participation and conviction of the citizens of danger , rejected by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions that he has provided for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , annual conference dedicated to the digital culture held in Berlin , dedicated an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , a publishing house published within three to five days , las@@ en extracts from the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective re@@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book that has been published last year and is available here licence @-@ free , contains a number of attempts to deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction there is :
this book also deals with how movements are being built for free knowledge and what the real cost is associated with which this is connected .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have been working on site to find out over the fo@@ g who surrounds our new@@ sletters , and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate the Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and consolidated internet volunteers that has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison , where he sat on October 3 , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information on his present state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , namely immediately . &quot;
&quot; seeing as Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and choices . &quot;
why are we today here ?
why did we decide ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ wise extreme con@@ vic@@ tions ?
the website developer for Open Source and digital Activ@@ ist has been in the custo@@ dy of government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el from the A@@ dra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military establishment , was transferred to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer of N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police force on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; signed command of the Military Tribunal from his cell in A@@ dra took . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported , she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented herself as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and placed it in an alleged death sentence against their husband . &quot;
his place of stay and condition remain unknown .
&quot; leading the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a vital role to expand access to the Internet and knowledge of the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technical ologist and currently passing the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; maybe none of Bas@@ sels were cultural prot@@ otypes present as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the Weg@@ kreu@@ z of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture with hi@@ vi@@ ous traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after having started with this work , the IS had to put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bo@@ died not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip in digital archaeological and conservation has created a time @-@ capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , this project was not able to complete this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my whole life with it , dream of freedom to dream and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call its name .
Bass@@ el brought me English even when he was in custo@@ dy .
&quot; I learned to read English well , write and speak English . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone , who asked . he has taught other det@@ ention , to write English and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet at .
&quot; he also contributed to other incar@@ cer@@ ated , as they use computers , at least theoretically , without which they actually held one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ xy , which she wrote in the years 2012 to the time of her husband , when he was in custo@@ dy . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura worked together on the book for a long time .
&quot; they sm@@ iled the texts to him , when she visited him and he translated it from the Arabian into English . &quot;
the book is license @-@ free .

the book is dedicated to the public domain .

that I reconc@@ iled in the world of your enchanting eyes
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment , in which we embrace ourselves , &quot;
that any of the dangers is no matter .
&quot; everyone of the f@@ ences , ch@@ ok@@ es and guards &quot;

Bas@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 , Bas@@ har al Assad &apos;s regime have gone more than 6@@ 5,000 people according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or abandoned under violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International has died in prison for at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in prison . &quot;
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community since 2012 calls for the release of b@@ ass@@ el .
we reiter@@ ate our call today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption verbal Director after provisional release , back to previous post &quot;
Moz@@ ambi@@ ic@@ ans re@@ acted with anger for a fighting case in which a Regi@@ stry is returned after half of his sentence to the workplace at the state apparatus in which the corruption was committed .
&quot; this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who were arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants . &quot;
the money par@@ ked from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que whose council Cam@@ b@@ aza was held between 2005 and 2008 .
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for a good guide and immediately called on his re @-@ attitude to the company , which happened on the 19th April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the Gover@@ nor Office of the Republic , which shares the request , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ b@@ aza to re@@ ap its old post since the company has no discipl@@ in@@ arity after his det@@ ention . &quot;
&quot; however , hot many inhabitants do not see the action very well . &quot;
&quot; the Center for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , negotiated in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to restore the director : &quot;
&quot; put a back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency , and is even a back@@ bone with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company should have been prefer@@ able for a discipline @-@ procedures against the resist@@ ers .
&quot; however , the company is apparently and promp@@ ted no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ an social media , rejected this behavior as well as regards the case as &quot; ref@@ uted &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a sentence and then half of them eat . &quot;
&quot; he could have paid lectures and motiv@@ ating talks , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has approved , to become rein@@ s@@ wine in the company , which he was helped harm . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
res@@ o@@ unding !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ ic@@ ans and Student of Political Science in Brazil , the director does not speak any morality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza from the state rewarded because he was rewarded him , I can &apos;t believe that someone has already rewarded someone in such a way that has already severely damaged the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing to return to morality and to serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to state the state , but instead it has only served itself by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza use the state as a hand it turned to an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself has become tired , which was charged and finally sentenced to a long det@@ ention . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind of that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; Di@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remain the Mos@@ ambi@@ que , not only for ever as the first independent president , but also as a disc@@ erning , in @-@ cutting and - side by saying - proph@@ etic Red@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of , even the f@@ ather@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I do not know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not that way . he does not change the tactics but he does not address his ambitions . &quot;
an ambitious man is criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also refl@@ ecting :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison he sat 10 years and came free .
&quot; and today , the company , in which he had to be contaminated , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ rever@@ ber@@ tus &quot; ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) , May 12 , 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Bro@@ mp@@ b@@ se .

&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their po@@ sts out of the net because it enth@@ used the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ indi@@ an origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or to become a part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements of the word has given an extremely remote k@@ onn@@ ation .
&quot; specifically , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight the hate speech in Myanmar , the company has set a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ Kal@@ ar , it may usually be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically calls themselves to hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word , or expressed a doubt of his use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same letter like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters , as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( cam@@ er@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ uses A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he enth@@ used the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends on a spiritual nature , whether they knew how he could lin@@ nen his back pain , as he did his back @-@ play . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) at Bur@@ m@@ ically - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; zin Win H@@ out is the opinion that they will reduce hate speech radi@@ cal@@ al nation@@ alists , but he also stressed that Facebook prov@@ ok@@ es all po@@ sts who ign@@ ores the suspic@@ ion of racism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
automation will not understand what you write on fac@@ ebook .
what it should do is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the next words .
&quot; for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot;
&quot; the good is that this dre@@ amer nation@@ alists , the hate speech spread , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ed its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , the hate speech may not spread long , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often becomes a cat@@ - and mouse game , using the users of social networks simply to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the restricted word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , as Facebook began to delete his posts as he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; of the social network is banned : &quot;
... &quot; when I was attentive to this new Directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically my post was removed from Facebook to me , the song@@ writing , post and parts of content for 24 hours is prohibited because the post &quot; Facebook Community standards un@@ met . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or which simply try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ an radi@@ al nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the letter , the author divided his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community around Council : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
words to c@@ ensor such words will only add more hate in the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and so words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; pe@@ ver@@ curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they tried not to right the mis@@ er@@ ated po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great turnover , it would be great . &quot;
com@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship made for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make use of Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their po@@ sts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts who have no hate speech , but nevertheless removed : &quot;
with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and inher@@ it@@ curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; only to try out whether Facebook is the post office , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; h@@ unted , &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;

&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used to expand the social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech should be forced into social networks into the communities in Myanmar in addition , particularly in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s were forced thousands of people . &quot;
Facebook was responsible for its failure to bring out the war@@ ms of Hass@@ an on its Bur@@ m@@ ish pages under control .
&quot; but instead of taking words &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running on context rather than on code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Tr@@ ini@@ dad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end with the children &apos;s clothes
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously adopted a law which aims to offer this practice so that the most vulnerable old age is at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of spouse , some members held Hin@@ doo and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 there came to a large public out@@ cry . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aja , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state did not hide , since that , age , not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened , regardless of the fact that Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contracting of UN &apos;s rights principle , the min@@ ors as , , every person under 18 years of age . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were already married to 15 percent in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 were 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 the statistical office of the country was confirmed , that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that stri@@ ves to create laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed big support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for instance , a Hin@@ du @-@ guide had no concerns , the critics of the children &apos;s marriage to say , they should , dam@@ n &apos;t even take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition cat@@ ered for tension in this actually in@@ complicated matter , and eventually there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the law . &quot;
&quot; but early 2017 , the draft law was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent subject which could be discussed at the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now only the president of the country must agree , and announce the law . &quot;
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave to Facebook a Status update , which was re @-@ posted to Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill &apos;s draft against the children &apos;s head was decided in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , with 35 votes for this and no one . &quot;
&quot; once prior to the Senate , the draft may now be applied to the law . &quot;
the majority of the social media user was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws of children have finally been changed .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has been too much time and unnecessary bar@@ ge needed to deal with the core of the matter but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now , and this is almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson the opinion was , it definitely was long enough to create the practice was Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas over@@ happy that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Out@@ standing news ! &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum ages - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that spoke very openly about how important the adoption of the law is , noted : &quot;
the hei@@ r@@ ats@@ able age in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious con@@ jun@@ ctions 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the change of the spouse has been approved today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; at the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the voting . &quot;
&quot; all members , who were opposed , have agreed for the law . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .

&quot; however , a possible hook arrives in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aja therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aja has proclaimed his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to rede@@ em his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the general state @-@ state Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , argu@@ ed it is quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj goes against the law , the majority of social media users would lead to the issue differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we think instead of discussing the discussion so general , in a way we &apos;d rather talk of the problem that our daughters to protect , that they may be of great , hard @-@ hard men who would be compared to them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , if it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places around the world where children &apos;s in different grad@@ ations are legal or continue to be the norm , although there are laws that they say . &quot;

&quot; at 11 times the news was removed from the site - in the middle memory , it remained intact . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday morning the office of the Prosec@@ utor &apos;s office shared the local news service Yar@@ ns with , that they were ch@@ opped . &quot;
the mir@@ rors of web sites can be viewed from Turkish users back Wikipedia @-@ content
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A Copyright law in the USA , internationally ob@@ s@@ cured . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month , Turkey has now applied the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enzy@@ cyclop@@ edia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day after day becomes more evident , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ por@@ ters and fans of TV @-@ series are opposed to the blocking .
&quot; although many technology @-@ vers@@ ed Internet users are used to use ren@@ aming tools for hard @-@ block web sites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VP@@ N prevalence in the world ) , the most common Wikipedia user does not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been writing articles from Wikipedia , how recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been approved since 2007 , after the Internet law has been adopted ( No. 56@@ 51 ) . &quot;
&quot; to China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , there are several mir@@ ror@@ ations ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. computer @-@ calcul@@ ator connections ) , which does not lay down on the system of domain name and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;
the content is in spite of legal pro@@ hibition .
in a blo@@ c post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set off everything from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read content on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view all the Wikipedia , even if you cannot reach the website www.@@ black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also involved that this move is independent from the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and only about screen@@ shots and no li@@ ve@@ - or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
however Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid the sperm .
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to get similar Mir@@ ror@@ .co.uk as in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and employees at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
&quot; it is att@@ ain@@ ted to another URL which is not the original one . that , what you can see is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; in essence , the server leads the request to the correct Wikipedia page so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; for this is executed by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot;

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with bad ones and well @-@ balanced colors . &quot;
motivated him yourself to carry a camera to yourself and try to walk the situation .
at that time he was a kid .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , working to bring him to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that direct the attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese . &quot;
he described on Facebook how he helps him the first class location in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife ! ! &quot;
&quot; I just rested , just at home when suddenly called to Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my Father that was a leop@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river . &quot;
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I burned with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had been watching him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was found and I immediately started to cr@@ acks pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as sc@@ ary as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he was already standing by coun@@ ten@@ ance on coun@@ ten@@ ance : &quot;
a tiger can not distur@@ b from the opinion of the sheep with sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; even I was on the way home because suddenly the king appeared on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ wei@@ ks appeared . he immediately starts , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me by the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
but its passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days long , and mostly lived in one tent in order to make pictures in the Bar@@ dia National Park recording of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took up until he took a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information . &quot;
check out some of these photos .

&quot; this entry was posted by Kay@@ ona@@ az Kaly@@ fi@@ a and was originally published to Video Volunte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot;
a revised version has been published here as part of a Content @-@ Shar@@ ing Convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women are avoiding great care to speak the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pr@@ ad@@ esh to respect women because of social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should abuse the norm in order to put this practice in life . &quot;
&quot; in the last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a through a floo@@ d@@ dish , and managed by their family and the village community after they had raised a raised relative . &quot;
&quot; the tradition must also not name their wives , too , is also distributed among men . however , they have much less common than to fear , if at all , they should not meet this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly became the main pl@@ ague theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place just for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is powered by the community video Volunte@@ ers and stands up for the dismant@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was worked for seven years with the help of her Vide@@ ok@@ am@@ era to un@@ cover practices , such as children &apos;s marriage up to the execution of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected members , and heads those clubs . &quot;
they reported how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made for amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed up in her discussion , was meant by women who don &apos;t call her husband on behalf . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify with .
&quot; to speak out the name of their hus@@ bands , there is a Br@@ other that keeps them alive and never put into question . &quot;
Roh@@ ini thinks :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wishes him long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this , is regarded as depos@@ ited , as a woman without morality . &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , which has never called her husband before on the name , try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained for a long time after the video was at the end .
&quot; Pr@@ ak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; . some believed that there is a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women were protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the Round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pr@@ ad@@ esh .
&quot; after the video project , the women tried to get the discussion with a exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , desp@@ ised , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want , means that they cannot respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought to her husband &apos;s name on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the Bre@@ chen of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women may never be able to pronoun@@ ce the name of her sp@@ ouses . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that during all the exercise just before moving ; another chose to let the whole p@@ hal@@ ted frustration against him and his family by taking it away .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ alin rush about it , with an ancient fires , the women decided that they were actually trying to name their hus@@ bands with the name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a wife called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was stub@@ born , she got afraid and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I meant to do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation in violence was less understanding .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the galvan@@ ic red dot on the forehead , which indicates the marriage : &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the galvan@@ ic red point if he was doing it . &quot;
he laughs and I heard it to carry him .
&quot; the other women did not fully end up with it , but they think they are now in a better position to choose itself , not to wear it in some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do a trip at any discussion . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who what could hear , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced , and spoke about things , about whom they had never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini said :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and I also have some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are made to our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes .
some women in the group have only bore Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most this is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ em @-@ cur@@ ta to carry a wide shirt over a p@@ ants , they have not dre@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; after much contro@@ versy and discussion about the advantages of your own clos@@ eup , mor@@ als connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , jewellery @-@ yellow Roh@@ ini their own couple of cur@@ ry ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they have decided now to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can carry Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to create it . &quot;
&quot; at the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion is already changed , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles : &quot;
so far we have done small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of her husband &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do not make it yet , but only if they are alone and not the other family members . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now bear in their forehead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the sol@@ em@@ ing around more freedom of movement or their own clos@@ eup - at the end of a difficult to navigate .
&quot; by giving each other self confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
&quot; and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families , there will be a chain reaction when any woman goes back home and told others about what we are talking about and what we do . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the Mil@@ ek district , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims has been de@@ ferred and some of the organs have been removed .
&quot; two men were arrested and subsequently pun@@ ished , that the organs of sham@@ ans are used in Tanzania and Malawi . &quot;
&quot; there will be the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a Gl@@ ue man &apos;s head would bring gold , or wealth , explained the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that consecutive attacks have been registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group that is the target of reductions for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
&quot; this led to the fact that the UN in 2016 led to a mission in the South African country , to examine these practical . &quot;
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country , where the government has developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;

&quot; the persecution and ass@@ ass@@ ination of gl@@ amor@@ ous individuals for the extraction and selling of their organs in the district Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , is presum@@ ed by the traditional sham@@ ans in the district of Mos@@ ambi@@ que ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to which the victims had power in the head , the wealth of wealth . &quot;

&quot; the case of the arrest of Chinese Dis@@ ci@@ on Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer &apos;s lawyer had announced at the end of June , that he had been delivered to hospital for liver cancer at the end of June . &quot;

he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Department of Foreign Affairs in China referred to as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and tells a spokes@@ person , he said it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely temper@@ ed on the subject . &quot;

&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was gr@@ ated in Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government is telling nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations continued until December last year . Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon tour to China since 2010 has been largely blocked since 2010 .
&quot; once the message was common that Li@@ u had seriously fallen ill , the Nobel committee brought his hopes for a unconditional release and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to its inc@@ ub@@ ation , he was unable to charge his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July the European Parliament adopted a decision to free his wife , Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the peak of diplom@@ ats of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , Hannes Swoboda also called for release Li@@ us , as in a declaration on the 30th June afternoon : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions from Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive visits , which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the external world . &quot;
USA - USA
&quot; us , Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans now wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in this respect it may help him with his pleasure . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Poll@@ ey , announced the message agency AF@@ P on 27 June known that the embassy of the Chinese authorities call not only Li@@ u but to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the call of the US Embassy attracted an angry response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; no country have the right to uni@@ fy themselves and ir@@ responsible comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Poll@@ ey shared with that China should offer the following :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to medical care of its choice , which they are entitled to a Chinese Constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ kl@@ ey and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife uncondi@@ tionally . &quot;
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o uncondi@@ tionally so that he can move into a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; the German Government of Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope to get Li@@ u &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
&quot; reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency re@@ ters that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex for Li@@ u could be over@@ riding a visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian amb@@ assador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to make sure to be sure of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us At@@ tor@@ ney told AF@@ P before that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who may visit him every day , but the police always practiced the room in hospital and that it Li@@ u will not allow anyone outside , including his lawyers , talk and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells further :
&quot; Canada calls for China to release its international human rights compul@@ sory , including freedom of expression , maintain and release the rights of these rights . &quot;
France
&quot; French Foreign Affairs called for China in an Declaration on 29 June on , Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family shall have contact to him . &quot;
&quot; although the new@@ sletters France Info reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that no further information will be out whether France will ultimately be able to receive it . &quot;
Taiwan in Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the Federal Minister of Taiwan in Taiwan , on 27 June on , Li@@ u release and a greater tolerance of those at show the peaceful means for political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ w@@ anese leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on to allow the cran@@ ks intellectual Li@@ u to let themselves treat in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a Declaration on 28 June by Li@@ u , and gave him that many have asked him to pray for li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he was strict , in a harmon@@ ious , stabili@@ zing and prosp@@ erous China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o who signed charter on behalf of democracy , freedom and the rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly as Singapore is recognised as an independent state .
&quot; however according to the Minister of Minister of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot;
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting at a meeting of the international subsidiary of the Bar Association of New York , the Minister of New York marked the Ministers that a lot of people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because it was in Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supports Singapore as a city should be considered .
... nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is it where most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog of Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; to rot@@ ate logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this valuable country , we will say that we ultimately cannot be a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the sem@@ bl@@ ance of a flight in front of the responsibilities , a mandatory hur@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons given by Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bles : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; given that he appeared inev@@ it@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , it def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old Lei@@ er of the author@@ itarian rulers appear to be the preceding logic , as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; during the last week of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , the answers to his American guests were given to our press , our J@@ dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ responses . &quot;
corresponding questions super@@ vised with non @-@ answers to rational nature .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am to show his opinion , as they did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to sw@@ allow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is to which country is owned by our city ... &quot;
&quot; short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very thankful when our fl@@ our K Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clear this point where he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; on the blog posts his comment , he points to the reviews that you should begin to understand the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference so that Singapore could better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gr@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city , and no country . &quot;
read the Con@@ scription .
&quot; as he said that Singapore was rather a city &quot; &quot; be as a country , &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equally important , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he is in Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; was not a country , &quot; he obviously does not have it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am who makes as a leader of a her@@ an@@ ous generation to such a pol@@ em@@ ous statement .
&quot; I am talking about what the Minister of Minister of Singapore has said , ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew by Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which I expected - be I agree with them or not , but that is another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders from Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that he really believes is what he defended . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review outlines the shortcomings of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ ams arguments :
did Mr Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am &quot; committed a mistake or was it a fre@@ ud@@ der speaker ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role within the governance , the statements of Mr Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am is of heavy importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the aer@@ ators render their military service , they defend only their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink human resource ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always was a city : &quot;
&quot; I have not told what I said ... &quot;
this phrase seems to have anno@@ yed many tears ....
&quot; nobody ever said , Singapore is a country . &quot;
we were always a city .
we have always been a city - / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; etc . , &quot; but that is not entirely correct . &quot;
we should speak more of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices also asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your home or home country ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and to be shown another fac@@ et . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor of Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question , which is put in Japan most , is : &quot; Are you American ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I said , &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the interview takes place , it is considered to be polite to show interest in his conversation with personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clar@@ inet follows then mostly the default response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook perhaps inn@@ war@@ dly in front of anger , if they are held for Americans but don &apos;t distur@@ b it . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many can@@ ans a can@@ adian flag visible are visible in their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began 20 years ago , travelling around the world - Donald Tru@@ mp , prior to the march in Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le sheets to their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
&quot; for us , there are no weapons ! &quot;
gender E@@ hen have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are courteous .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; ap@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is alleg@@ edly regarded as the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I appreciated . &quot;
there would be nothing to do if I would like to switch myself from Dallas with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &apos; nice .
&quot; first : as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; to be called , basically , sp@@ elled to be - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; &quot; Simp@@ son &quot; &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing , where you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
&quot; this can be something good when one wants to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go back to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main character of the Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders described as &apos; nice &apos; is perhaps just cool .
Can@@ adi@@ ans often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada straight to sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand @-@ famous pop band has published a music video , which the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , which 2014 will restore power and restore civil government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells them what rules make him his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers directly to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video about the song was an amazing success .
&quot; only within the first three days , the video was divided on Facebook by Facebook , and received 8.@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; The dict@@ ator was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists asked the public to look at this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policies , in@@ particular how it beh@@ aves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta &apos;s rule . &quot;
&quot; look at the videos of the video once to refer to some of the political issues , which Thailand has been per@@ sever@@ ed in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dr@@ ak@@ onic section 44 of the provisional constitution , which makes the com@@ mander of the army absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; setup change &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are considered from Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by authorities to minimize activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit in the army was established , super@@ vis@@ ing the online content and individuals , which were accused , the monarchy will be prosec@@ uted , criminal prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a strike against the &apos; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &apos; ( Maj@@ est@@ en@@ forced &apos; ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war was established in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the Army .
&quot; one of the problems that pursu@@ es the Jun@@ ta still pursu@@ es , its decision to buy expensive sub@@ boats , although security experts they war@@ ned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax waste . &quot;
&quot; in the video it &apos;s even shown how people are thrown into a black list , before you put them into a interference storage , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in the prison , because they have created &quot; confusion &quot; in society and have used Internet users will attack long det@@ ention conditions , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band presented the song from &quot; &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; &quot; which has already been used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and is published here with friendly permission . &quot;
the post @-@ war @-@ war was only very slow in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has been over 20 years since the Georgian war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon @-@ basin of Ab@@ f@@ antasi@@ es . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , f@@ antasi@@ es , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on sovi@@ ets in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , some Russians and ch@@ asing are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also known in Ab@@ ch@@ asia as well as ho@@ ster@@ oids .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people still lived here are just a few hundred people in these fi@@ ster@@ ols . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; for 2011 , the total population of the 16.@@ 000 people were barely rising after over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chev , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are covered and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance to the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it turns him hard to finish this .
&quot; it all is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why ? &quot;
it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens who are all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable splend@@ or buildings .
&quot; the people who were once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , meanwhile have left the district . &quot;
in the Gei@@ ster@@ town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live approximately fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chev , which can accommodate one or two families , one recogni@@ zes the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of an destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately move back . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us , let us photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she has simply forbidden it , that is all . &quot;
the girl fle@@ ece their girlfriend something to and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence sector ( cultivation of scenic products for their own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable structure . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the District government supplies the winter for free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ chini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or ante G@@ alya as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jun@@ k tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left f@@ antasi@@ es to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ ch@@ es for ever . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial support from her daughter , and insi@@ sted that her young grand@@ son is now supported . &quot;
Gal@@ inas &apos;s months are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;

G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ational in Nat@@ asch@@ a has lived together with her husband and five common children in their home for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when war began .
every day they remember the village itself before the war .

&quot; we do not be afraid of the dark road or the few people .
one can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with pill@@ age .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember each day like the city and the war once were .
&quot; as our conversation with the end , a little boy bur@@ ns us over . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy h@@ unted to him .
&quot; he plays with the ball , which then goes down the hill . &quot;
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; whilst they run , some of them throw stones on the cas@@ hed buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which care for in@@ erti@@ ght in their lives . &quot;

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants at their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ acken was released on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org , and is published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; across the road of migrants , across Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is on the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
&quot; it is run by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ cro@@ ell and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy @-@ bears form . &quot;
it is called Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was raised in Tap@@ ach@@ ula . nevertheless they know many of the names of Mama Africa .
&quot; this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ ti@@ aner , who are on the road . &quot;
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with cold , ab@@ cru@@ m@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez talks about the people of Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and the upper part of the coast begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard boxes . &quot;
it does not want to decline anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings her to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medications that they can not pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ sam that depl@@ eted away from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently in a short time . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ um Africa is a suitable nickname for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ go@@ at@@ ee ) posi@@ ert with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , since African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao is traveling with his sister , which hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other Way@@ showers of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans often talk together the route and that the Afri@@ cans speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
how many of his departure companion has been living in Brazil in advance and worked as a building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup Championship .
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months , and sold SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money to buy the B@@ usti@@ cket to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave it again , &quot; &quot; answers he smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells that their guests will often send back words when they are going to cra@@ ze them or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith in the drive of their work is .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family were taken in their small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and has established that the B@@ usti@@ tes to numerous African migrants are too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered . &quot;
&quot; there are 25 people present at the moment , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ aner . &quot;
&quot; some sleeping on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchenette . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants that travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he escap@@ ed in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to be black@@ ma@@ iled from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he was in demand for an accommodation , and an unknown , a single @-@ er@@ one , has offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back to the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses they consult passengers their teleph@@ ones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy about her house , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who went away . &quot;
&quot; like a glorious grand@@ mother , she is fed to her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair fl@@ es who made her a manifestation , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and Old Man . &quot;
she laughs so she told me shortly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; she is repeated every time . &quot; &quot; they are already gone . &quot;
&quot; China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app , on their phones . &quot;
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang , from Twitter users , and become ri@@ ght@@ less ri@@ cher . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China are comp@@ elled to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July the mobile phone users at the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the City of Uru@@ m@@ qi , received a cell notice in which it has the District Government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in this statement , the app is said to obtain access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; yet , the authorities use the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women took place in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed shortly after they had replaced the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the message of the police , the app would determine the sources and distribution of terrorists , and pursue , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a service service with system @-@ categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ph@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ age porno@@ graphic web sites , of online @-@ fraud , Tro@@ re@@ ars and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control our own home network . &quot;
this app with the fil@@ tering for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers can provide to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al from it . &quot;
this introduction will be in line with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports of digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme to@@ cks and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ ing Internet inter@@ connection . &quot;
&quot; the media @-@ out@@ let media @-@ out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( self @-@ growing ) , published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point , at the polic@@ eman the residents op@@ tionally un@@ checked whether they had installed the surveillance system . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app . &quot;
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they have been forced to use the people , tools that are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of cap@@ tivity through the ber@@ ant technology .
we are back again in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( c@@ mi@@ l ) , it also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software is able to up@@ lift up a Windows operating system and therefore gets unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and phones into X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a response to the instructions of the city of Party , to minimize the dissem@@ ination of illegal contents . &quot;
&quot; all governmental organizations , authorities and related institutions including universities and research institutes are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report from Freedom House , an American Human Rights organization , also mentioned this new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi , calling for its &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , not@@ ebooks , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; however . this action is however in@@ ju@@ red the personal rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , including those that refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death - part 1 : everything sh@@ aking after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane presents his experiences in a Syrian prison .
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ ar that you are all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has been solved and resolved , and a truth is un@@ vei@@ led , which is clearly recognizable from both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes her name all glory .
one who pressed into a list of feelings and expres@@ sions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you pick up the reality and you get behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and performers - turn the characters into being of flesh and blood , and all sh@@ outing after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts solve themselves in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is tr@@ apped on the axis of the beast that you are caught up here between the walls , who have your parents , and especially your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but I don &apos;t think so that I &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; like the head of the security manager - with the promise , that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he presented his power over us by proof that he even destroyed the simpl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn apart during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was taken , so that the city gave the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; all@@ ahu &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all city districts , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put a high demands on a city that turned into the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply within the neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; I broke the silence , by removing several times &quot; &quot; O Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house . &quot;
I heard my voice by the silence resist@@ ances .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt cour@@ ageous enough to mu@@ ster .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we collabor@@ ated with a great image that filled my expectations full and filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you realize that you liber@@ ate the spirit from the lamp , but you simply do not be interested in the righteous . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot;
he placed on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can give you your voice , after you sent them all the way up to the office of the safety service from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the ruler of Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak , &quot; let me hear how you &quot; &quot; all &apos;@@ ahu is &quot; scre@@ am , or you are only brave enough to cry out if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes were judged on me .
and you really love what to look in the eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; maybe it was in my Tor@@ r@@ ity , van@@ ity , maybe to the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure , when I rep@@ lied , &quot; I have not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ it@@ ary , and his father equal with it . &quot;
&quot; his father equal with them , &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this flu@@ ent set is up to now in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture which I was exposed to months . &quot;
I sear@@ ched the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
&quot; afterwards , through the farm and into the second office , that leads through a gear to the single cells . &quot;
I character@@ ize all the details exactly before I super@@ vised the room .
otherwise than usual they obviously have a larger cell .
&quot; I have to share it with only one further prisoners and must immediately sit down , without having to wait for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I took back to an old @-@ tested communication method : to hit the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ com@@ rade was a &quot; y@@ sth@@ ess &quot; was .
after a long hes@@ itation he rep@@ lied to me ultimately .
&quot; apparently , in no one of the surrounding cells was a respectable man middle age that looks similar to me and &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no mark@@ eters can be seen in me , and doctors are not here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
maybe someone who sounds like my voice like my sounds ?
all the answers are connected to their existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I ab@@ ide . &quot;
LÃ¼@@ g@@ ner .
&quot; I would like to have had a bird @-@ hat@@ ch to distribute all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled to the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the far , I still hear them all the &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always at this time , the writer , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that Black is the colour of the promise , until I saw the yellow light that presented us to the Gre@@ ys : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Th@@ under &quot; , &quot; play@@ back on 13 S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to hear sounds .
&quot; thus the secret was out of the secret : to protect the state of security before us , they speak the tra@@ it@@ ors and the terrorists in us , speak they in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ fes@@ sions the narrow field of view of their world@@ view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which here is not a land ; it is a cur@@ se that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of her cl@@ ans into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I support the g@@ rief and tre@@ ad on Abu I@@ mad , a slim and mu@@ ddy man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; it starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expres@@ sions that do it ent@@ ails : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can attach so much more important to your life than close this Tag@@ edi@@ tions and protest to demonstrations against it soon . &quot;
I rep@@ lied .
&quot; I got used to myself , not to answer . &quot;
I can really no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and stro@@ kes have become an ordinary communication means for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me told me that I would like to get used to be pun@@ ished , pun@@ ished , although I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
to punishment in all their variety .
&quot; his command is to tear me away as much meat as possible from the body . &quot;
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ able . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er Gi@@ ded himself to your crying .
&quot; give it the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you can &apos;t with@@ hold your writing . &quot;
&quot; my scri@@ be answered him not enough , why they negotiated the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first capture , I asked whether the investig@@ ators had worked as a gar@@ bage dump or whether it belonged to the normal working office . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined , to present us from their perspective , great invention of a huge cables . &quot;
&quot; within one hour three of them rarely changed three of them , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any sense in my body - and my voice , which is why I heard up . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er spot@@ ted the cooling and found no means of making it an electric loaded off .
&quot; flow through my entire body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ bare body , the spread on the ground was the perfect electricity conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this will probably have been so at midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; a few hours passed , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to dawn .
&quot; the door opens and the dawn meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of an exhaus@@ tive youth : &quot; &quot; my master , my Father has to worry about fear@@ ful worries . &quot;
&quot; be silent and be@@ away you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jam@@ ord@@ al Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b speak about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was recorded by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the most of his time inside ; times he mu@@ en@@ ers on his canvas , once again his computer , back and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; what one can rely on , however , is a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ted lips to discover . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has been part of them since 1967 ; in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs families had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine , where she lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression by art and rap@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; with his music that often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues can not only be found in his native town of Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance but also in cities that suff@@ ice from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa at Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with its 25 years of age , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who can &apos;t be restricted in his mind , and he can feel his own testimony with the people who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly exist , he defeated a special appeal against the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe its compassion for those who attempt to survive in war zones , anything but what he was born in war , even if he was born in Jordan , and so far has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think of my own living conditions , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man &quot; &quot; while he sho@@ ok into two cups in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the law also says that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ adan .
&quot; obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ur@@ ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sing hot j@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the s@@ warm coffee and the s@@ ay@@ ings of the k@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when one thro@@ ws a view into the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; so it avo@@ ids easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during the Ram@@ adan water , in order to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently the Interior of Jordan has said an appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; a few MPs , supporting the Islamic action on the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual fron@@ ts of Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o says the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert series . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former spokes@@ person of the Islamic coalition of D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was &quot; just &quot; just because of the sexual orientation of the sc@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; many also assert that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism that questioned the Ancient and author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ ained people as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; that continue to work for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement may not be easy for sei@@ zing rh@@ et@@ oric , but in fact an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan will reflect that in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work clearly appears . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender ast@@ or@@ men came to Lei@@ be , having made his vision of the fate of Arab women , which have had sex . &quot;
&quot; the image shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently crus@@ hed un@@ familiar woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who have actually trust them .
in the past years the number of &apos; hon@@ orary ass@@ ass@@ ination &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside in Jordan .
&quot; human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak in 2016 ; however , that Jordan is still missing that Jordan has turned the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted to support victims of murder and domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on sho@@ cking control from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to in@@ tra @-@ familiar violence , and for their release is often a years of bureaucr@@ atic effort as well as guarantee on the part of the family that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is known for it , also not to retreat from issues that are long in the country for a long time . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b argu@@ ed that his work is politically , however , is a fact that he is his music , which is full of explicit attacks on sexuality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Man . &quot;
&quot; I was denied politics , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; lies in the focus on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of the songs , which are politically politically , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and any other is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words , &quot; that is what you want &quot; - be faith or non @-@ faith , heter@@ ogen@@ ic or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on gender equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals were still sharp@@ ly se@@ ated in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ ained Onlin@@ e@@ programm Ro@@ ya , to remember later that his comments were torn from the context , revol@@ ves and his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but they were only a processed version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b drives openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ oler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als do not meet the Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ts , a poet from the eighth century , who is still alive today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks themselves : if Abu Nu@@ what , who would later work on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the eighth century openly about homosexu@@ ality could do , why can Jordan that not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom , there is nothing new to say that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ ained message company collabor@@ ated several former governmental organizations and members of the teacher association , with the reason@@ ing , they have expressed themselves on comments in social media and cri@@ tici@@ zed with deep in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs believes that only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la now sees a appearance for the second time - consists of slow , bed@@ ding and intern@@ ation changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ ani society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dre@@ aming not only of his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of it . &quot;
&quot; maybe the region is going to work with music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bom@@ bs , aspir@@ ing and artificial democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to res@@ ist and therefore also res@@ ist resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
these big , ex@@ travag@@ ant warri@@ or are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it is thought that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festivals , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ d . another theory said that the car@@ ving , the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years were cultivated , in the armies from the west of Japan to impose the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the kne@@ es . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to sn@@ ap a couple of great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a communal center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted an two mon@@ oton@@ ous exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have long looked at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two star@@ cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the neb@@ uta Festival the only True - and yet to spend a breath taking in this summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high solid wagon was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historical center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoke and pir@@ ated drug stores are daily . &quot;
&quot; a survey released in April 2017 , that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and therefore also the fancy hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , led to embar@@ k on the experienced hands of hair@@ styles who can make these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , who go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the Fris@@ o &quot; Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there will be experts on each other to show who you can create the ec@@ cent@@ red L@@ ooks , as one can see in the following video ( further videos on current tournaments on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; education institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , here is an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to convince their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to find a training in the hair@@ dressing tools that allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the bid@@ ding possibilities have seen do@@ zens of young people , that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special instruc@@ tive workshops about the school starting March in March and reported about some of their achievements :
&quot; 1995 we were the only school in the church and the district , where we are very proud , because from love to the children we have built this educational community . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the processed version of the paper &quot; &quot; love @-@ makers at guer@@ ri@@ lla warri@@ ors &quot; , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea after T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
this entry will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we just write attention to people that we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel out@@ going with affection ? &quot;
this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ rag@@ a from the Foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation not more from the head and inspir@@ es them to the Camp@@ a@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ ci@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters for reconciliation ) to write the young people to write guer@@ ri@@ lla &apos;s letters .
&quot; just before the short time , her country was the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces in Colombia ) , which forms the sl@@ ender of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally the sig@@ nat@@ al of the peace treaty was considered as significant , that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
but in front of the Colom@@ bian people there is a long way to talk about a real reconciliation and peace .
&quot; gri@@ lled damp@@ er who lived for many years in illi@@ c@@ ines , having been exposed to a war of war and around the clock to tru@@ sts their weapons , now they have to integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases has acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , it must now take into its ranks and support them to build a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to join forces and would have to help with the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people are written - love @-@ ships to former guer@@ ri@@ lla warri@@ ors to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ lla warri@@ ors that should then be passed on to personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters for reconciliation was created at the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , which was held in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the possibility of speaking shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ th@@ i , the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded . &quot;
&quot; he explained that we love the people who love to write on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , thousands of love letters , but those who need much needed . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he re@@ spoke to share his love with people this year , who needed more urgent . &quot;
&quot; thus , the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC , who now have their place in society and establish a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is present in all major towns of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
&quot; I have never thought , that someone would forgive me &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over in one of the UN warehouse in the Cal@@ don@@ o region in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of J@@ aver@@ iana takes place in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ al administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art , in order to bring the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of F@@ ARC placed so on as they did earlier , in order to take the orders of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all parties . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in @-@ between , &quot; &quot; the political knowledge of Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former fighter carried me through the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa @-@ fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla warri@@ ors live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla warri@@ ors that wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to come down , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ designer , a le@@ thal weapon in the thorn @-@ sheep . &quot;
&quot; I still spoke him and asked , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they have just ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answered a letter that someone wrote me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I quickly responded to it . I suddenly had the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I strongly im@@ pover@@ ished him and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ers .
perhaps he was p@@ ity also he was p@@ ity to be all the years of faithful companion of this struggle and wanted to help him write this letter .
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from hunger . &quot; I have never imagined that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now , I know that there is a society outside , waiting with open arms to us . &quot;
&quot; until now , I just learnt as I have to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; now where peace is reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the opening , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC entered a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all raised up as war and the F@@ ARC already prev@@ ailed in secret .
&quot; therefore the leader of the F@@ ARC , the history of the organization , its ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years long , we have experienced how social injustice through the state of Colom@@ bian people have emerged , we can help us shape society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who had never been hearing never before and had no elec@@ toral law , and to recognize that the people that I have often seen as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does me sore . &quot;
&quot; but it com@@ for@@ ted me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage , we can teach us something and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the Commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
&quot; Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ern was made , that after the dis@@ armament peace will reign . &quot;
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to grasp the weapons and protect themselves for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from F@@ ARC are now on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call for all def@@ ender of peace - regardless of what race , religion or ideology to belong to it - to rise above all that dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrific@@ es , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; it follows the translation of an article , which was written by uns@@ rem Partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ su@@ mo@@ wa and whose original release was published on the OC Media website . &quot;
&quot; hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
with fri@@ ght have activists the coverage of the last few months on the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat , which is like a d@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ try about the local LGB@@ T@@ Q municipality , is not only created overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared a few of their experiences with us and talked about what happens in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered several months ago the international head@@ lines , after reports have been published , which has been published the abra@@ sion , torture and killing que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ az@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; it cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspected que@@ er men strongh@@ olds and they in secret pris@@ ons in the gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; even since their childhood , she sen@@ sed that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she became growing , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which was why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen was experienced by the gender equality of her land@@ lady , the hunting was opened on Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; because of fear for her life , they moved to the USA in the final analysis . &quot;
Sabrina : I was active as an hon@@ orary assistant in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a acquain@@ tance from Dag@@ est@@ an , a Trans@@ wife , which arose in difficulties . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I accepted her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her to help her , he made a friend of my documents and spread her all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his ch@@ echn@@ yan friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
afterwards the photos of my documents made the round of my documents entirely by the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just doing some shopping st@@ ems from the back of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice to say : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I sen@@ sed something in my body , but I did not get hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you want to escape the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up again in the hospital again .
&quot; apparently , some women had gotten back all and beginning to cry out . &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambulance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two key@@ fr@@ onds in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary wings .
OC Media : in which ambulance si@@ wings have been laid - in which the men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are de@@ prec@@ ated , there still is my male name dr@@ auf ; but the doctor understood and put me on the women . &quot;
&quot; for this , I am very grateful . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim @-@ mix@@ er , a k@@ au@@ kas@@ y name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am thankful to him that he is respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some remote relatives .
&quot; they demanded me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that everything was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they asked absur@@ de demands : some said to me , I must prove it by going up without the streets ; others wanted that I had not changed on official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that all was only Schl@@ ech@@ tre@@ de , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have Soli@@ b@@ room size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older people even spoke my mother on the streets .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that is not only your family , but the whole of the Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you , because you are a go@@ dly woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother was too much , and she lay down a strike around the neck . &quot;
fortunately the neighbors and ret@@ ted them .
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with pic@@ tured window plates and a number plate with a diameter of 95 .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it was clear to me that there was something lazy . &quot;
my human rights @-@ friends over@@ beat the number of numbers - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how have you been flying ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; out of safety reasons I will not award their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it , without sign up , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SI@@ M card and threw it in the rub@@ b@@ ish .
arrived and chec@@ s into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ gers .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you warmer in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which hotel you do . you even know your immune number . &quot;
only to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my m@@ ould number .
OC Media : do you still stand in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the gender equality however , that is a tab@@ ular topic . &quot;
some traditional k@@ au@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements I still carry in myself .
so I wish to overcome this spiritual barrier I can not overcome .
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we ch@@ atting with camera , I actually give me effort to see how the person reminds them of her past - so in my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what are your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sabrina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the I needed current information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; I spoke with someone , the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not shut down a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; that is my I , they probably invite relatives before they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demanding a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are now still stuck for men in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a famili@@ y from me says there was just not very many .
&quot; if , then most of all those who have no rich relatives , or those of their relatives were dropped to face Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there , so that you can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be converted , you will show your body on TV and claim that they would have attacked either your village or a military base . &quot;
understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but specifically targeted to radi@@ ate themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I just have someone who was det@@ ained for an and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown up beard .
there have been nothing new of them since .
they simply took them away .
&quot; and this so called Lord , that person himself was taken as these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , they were not presented as band@@ widths so far , there have been no reports so far . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would it not have been allowed to shave this man to shave ?
&quot; do you know if this persecution and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , &quot; already in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always contributed my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe in 2003 I was already known to Gros@@ ny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia was originally intended to lead us to the &quot; civil &quot; civil@@ isation , &quot; but finally left us back to the St@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were wo@@ unded ; I had colored eyelashes that carried sm@@ ili@@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops .
the security of the sh@@ aria has never tri@@ mm@@ ed me only one hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where each evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been sinn@@ ed .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that said : &quot; Sp@@ ote is not about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
it is often said to children if that make himself funny .
&quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are ill ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they have never sinn@@ ed , never h@@ unted and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ at work hold ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister , he began to speak on mor@@ als on mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
nevertheless - one could sense how people began to change in the city .
who had previously served and pun@@ ched for he considered once again with suspic@@ ion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I was able to feel like the situation in the Republic is ever wast@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much .
&quot; of this , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ up , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get Essen@@ sk@@ arten . &quot;
I do not have a c@@ ents for it .
I discovered these people myself when I found shelter .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : contribute to Hid@@ sch@@ ab
Sabrina : that is al@@ bern .
this is the nature that has nothing to do with religion at all .
&quot; that is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who wish to proph@@ es@@ ying you with foam before the mouth , that there is no oscill@@ ates with them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which , the Kab@@ ard@@ iner have which , the Russians , too , are they - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I am coming from there , therefore it is unpleasant for me to hear . &quot;
&quot; here , there are so many men coming from the Cau@@ cas@@ us . &quot;
&quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , who go into the mosque and during the Ram@@ adan , live together with males . &quot;
&quot; know that many think in transi@@ ence to men , men love , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a tru@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise , different environments . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not as@@ ham@@ ed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be here personally but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n of an increase of self @-@ mor@@ den within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab anc@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian ancestors region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high working class and poverty @-@ rate among the native Arab population .
for the past few months there has been a strong increase of self @-@ murder .
the photo of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August shifts the dist@@ res@@ sed situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran which is dominated by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ elight . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had one child , he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran . &quot;
&quot; he l@@ itt among anxiety , depression , and he bur@@ ns himself for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to be able to pay the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a on YouTube shared video held the moments , after having put it up . &quot;
&quot; some people make it quick to delete the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was put into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ ic@@ ide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists from the spot , war@@ n that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights found that month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im - hung . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : it was all family members who felt thanks to persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ capable to feed their families and to work a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi is suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination . &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large majority of those living in Iran live in Iran , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard to argue with the local Arab population . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy was taking power over and 1925 major efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the richest and most valuable asset for the Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is continuing to develop slowly , and the native population get only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime has denied systematic jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also has a large number of roofs , built the waters from the Arab areas into the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation in the region through dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi youths now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ OUR Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian head @-@ Director for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , announces that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is that seek a job , completed elementary school , 55 % a subsequent school and 45 % holding a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian A@@ wak@@ ing Human Rights activ@@ ist with a residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder among young ancestors . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z new in@@ coming ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot;

&quot; the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website , in which many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , that women today still earn less money than men despite the same education . &quot;
that women are still under str@@ ingent observation when it &apos;s about what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women occurred sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex still moves through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and well known .
I am convinced of it and I am suffering twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I get to speak on skin colour , on black CIS women , on black soil women , on black women in the LGB@@ T community , or on black women from the Dias@@ pora , as we have always been under racial , spiritual and verbal abuse , as well as outside the femin@@ ist movement , that many white femin@@ ists decide to be silent as well as in white inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; however , all women agree that women - all women - should come together to sing &quot; their votes and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about it , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women on a two @-@ fold way . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin of origin are less than white men and women .
that black girl and girls with a migration background may be referred to school as a white girl because of obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women in black spheres , and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand I will say that all women , all men and all men do not join any skin colour ; on the other hand , I can consider myself as a black woman , to take into account the white woman who refuse to consider both the gender and the skin colour of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight to fight my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented spheres , which always rejected me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner urged 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and also I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized being in historical respect . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me to include group@@ ings , which are also absor@@ bing our customs and customs to advance its eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to lay white women the importance of over@@ cuts of skin colour and gender , as some of them will continue to keep the meaning of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to imp@@ ly them for better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ism was founded to give women a home from different cultures and to limit himself from the white femin@@ ism , still is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I think it was full of femin@@ ism and to join the movement of wom@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of fighting for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradi@@ gm , which is so stub@@ born , that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and embar@@ k into the spheres , which are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves to us , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately calling for separ@@ atism and exclusion , after they have read these lines , please refer to the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of femin@@ ist movement by which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can em@@ ate black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradi@@ gm I have existed . &quot;
&quot; due to my dark skin and because of my existence , I was recognized as a woman as a part of this paradi@@ gm . &quot;
&quot; I , a black wife , can flo@@ wering in a environment where my life is neither escap@@ ed nor ignored . &quot;
&quot; p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man , to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations &quot;
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ ters was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , which reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
as part of a content sharing agreement this article will be again published here .
&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who explains us his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his church . &quot;
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of storage , the pollution and the un@@ controll@@ able development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the Association of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ en@@ eper Alliance - to protect themselves and to protect rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a takes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work together in a question : &quot; &quot; if we had no water any more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for du@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , produced in Iraq and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , filmed and published . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on persec@@ uted , little considerable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ oper@@ atively vide@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with the aid of oppressed churches to tell their stories in their way . &quot;
Paraguay . women and their severe fight against violence

&quot; the following article is the shor@@ tened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ ght@@ fully @-@ consuming ) , which reports about the certain@@ ties towards women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed for the protection of the person concerned .
&quot; a police show@@ ab@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she has nothing to do against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , its export partner that has become violent towards violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship was a little time past and the police said , their statement would be placed to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman bal@@ bu@@ ena due to failures , the ac@@ ten@@ ant display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez did not take anything . &quot;
a few days later the second woman drew its ad back .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; when women are re@@ viewing at all , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women also depend financially by the men that they mi@@ tig@@ ate . this explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , to be in general at all law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content and Statisti@@ c 2 Un@@ visible ab@@ uses and a judicial system , which nothing sub@@ ni@@ mm@@ ed of Paraguay ; good approach , lack of implementation and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really mis@@ used , &quot; says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , research for gen@@ der@@ questions at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
but the numbers available are very alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , at the District Court of 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % of them it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads made at the police came from women .
&quot; there were over 5,000 ads because of domestic violence at the peace court . here also 86 % of the ads . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of the women , that they were physically health@@ ful , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics are not showing the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these criminal off@@ ences are actually displayed only . &quot; on every woman who are re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psychological failures , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; to any woman who will be re@@ funded because of body abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; explained it at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s genocide in Paraguay have no own crimes , the prosec@@ ution cannot be appropri@@ ately documented how many women killed each year from their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 , journalists were at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ ic@@ ide in the country . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay have at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mis@@ uses and a judicial system that takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the solid friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called her the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , she did not want it , but there was something for ever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana 28 years old and no more have been together with Carlos . but two years ago she contributed the psychological force of violence against women and at the same time the most common form of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zes the most severe . &quot;
I have never imagined that I would have been a victim of ab@@ uses .
&quot; when I read earlier , I always thought that only women are occurring that are to be sub@@ mis@@ sive because they dec@@ eive themselves by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name name , she wrote articles on Facebook , in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he wanted them isolated . &quot;
&quot; many people answered on their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ oric if he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to admit that his behaviour also had a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had taken this so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of ab@@ uses at least have a certain compli@@ city to it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which is not native by Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner they abuse . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe &quot; ) that consists of women all in some way victims of mis@@ uses .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
you do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case all began with psych@@ ic abuse .
&quot; their wealthy partners finally managed to convince , to convince them that they were worth@@ less . &quot;
then he started to beat her .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as indicators in the authorities stayed without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; led a process against their former partners who developed into an im@@ penet@@ r@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach to lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but are not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of ab@@ uses is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , looks also great issues when applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , who became known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Prince ) . &quot;
this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that will be supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original accus@@ ation of the law fores@@ ees to explain to a self @-@ constant criminal off@@ ences and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the law@@ ful text was changed in several points to also gain members for the law , to be feared that the road for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions will be banned , which are generally forbidden in Paraguay and can be pun@@ ished with up to five years in jail . &quot;
&quot; the original law@@ ful law did not fores@@ ee , most of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) procedure that have to bear the victims of violence currently , if they simply have to re@@ funding and maintain a safe accommodation to the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure does not provide adequate financial resources for this purpose :
in Paraguay is considered mi@@ tig@@ ate as part of inter@@ personal relations .
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking is to take place , so that violence does not have more than anything Nor@@ mal . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; who is silent in view of these facts , makes it guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of crimin@@ als . &quot;
we have to re@@ funding this long term until Mis@@ abuse is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Sen@@ at was adopted . previously , parts of the law was changed . however , a passage of passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence has been brought to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity to ag@@ gres@@ sor his victim again .
&quot; the del@@ e@@ tion of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; out of parts of the law applies however as great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man still exposed to pro@@ hibition of a newspaper
&quot; this website was blocked because of a decision taken by the Information Society , on the homepage of the ban newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have concluded an independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting about corruption in the sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ da Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to prison , where he hi@@ des a one @-@ year prison . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ al Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put in court , but later returned . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been governed by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had stir@@ red his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; since then , he dressed , in addition to his role as the sole sult@@ an , the most important minist@@ ries in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Secretary of Foreign Ministers , Secretary of the Council for planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the sult@@ ans is characterised by the ten@@ acious efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic secrecy , including freedom of freedom , including press freedom , blo@@ ggers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ d and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peace and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and hin@@ der citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country like corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper her closing and the imprisonment three of her editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent magazine , which has been reported since its founding in 2007 on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , firm , after in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , an article with the title &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; was published . in this , it was about corruption in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused , judge of the Supreme Court in O@@ man under pressure to raise a verdi@@ ct in an inheritance . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 , with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ level parties bind hands of the judiciary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ al Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the Board of Directors , was charged by the ISS before the special department and was arrested by the security guards upon his arrival . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS awarded the dep@@ uty chief editor for Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acts as chief editor according to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; the paper was closed at un@@ specified time , after the information he had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the initial trial began in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to jail sentences and also ord@@ ained the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned to the disorder of public order , mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state of the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of an audience and its destruction . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of det@@ ention and money pen@@ alties in the amount of 3000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition one year &apos;s profession had promised against the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a sentence of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after making use of a information network which could pose a threat to public order .
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit was fixed at the amount of 5000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released from the prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ als Court said Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing held on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j said to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i for six months . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after the completion of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he hi@@ des his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ als also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information , the newspaper &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the paper looks after attacks by the om@@ anic government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8th , the Information Minister brought a statement by which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information is personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which ministers appeared another time against the decision of the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al to permit the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspapers are not the only ones in which the press has been viol@@ ated in .
&quot; for example , the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country to stop their operations . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not prepared to make an end to the extensive injury of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is calling for the om@@ anic authorities : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and uncondi@@ tionally free ;
&quot; 2 . a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can go down their work . &quot;
3 . press freedom in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man their legitimate human rights work , and without fear of contrac@@ tions , including judicial sli@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in adjacent countries by promoting the opinion and association freedom and the right to meet peaceful , supported and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , figure takes place with your consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need for free medical research there are two reasons , such as a lack in the offer of global health being many drugs and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria in the poorest countries of Africa are far more serious effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment in resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , in setting up its own research funds in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the Center of Center for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS @-@ epide@@ mic first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself addressed the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ arian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ or discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media over this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ arian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I was a research programme for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s . &quot;
G@@ V : what are your opinion of the important recent academic themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there is no basic research here . we only set solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; that needs to change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers , rather than to be creators . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well funded .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because the financing and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
R@@ W : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate and how can we support the development ? &quot;
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; the social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
G@@ V : allows you to describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; R@@ W : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the complicated access to scientific expertise , who are facing challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of availability information and the speed of research . &quot;

Frank Mor@@ ton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ fit , the first plant , which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA @-@ A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in Space . &quot;
&quot; for nearly 20 years Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was achieved only through his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question , how many sal@@ ut@@ ors can get , are set limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented , and that he could not use it for breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents vary not only to individual sorts , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green , or bent leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years more and more such patents have been submitted to more and more plants such as cer@@ eals or cart@@ ons . due to these trends , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mor@@ ton still salad , but now he needs no longer , since his work is growing ever more and more limitations . &quot;
&quot; it is , as would lie in a river a rock so@@ cks , around which I must be sw@@ add@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go on sal@@ ads too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they with@@ stand before judgment , no one can breed any more of a new sal@@ ads , because all characteristics are already patented . &quot; &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he also connected a movement that is getting bigger in the U.S. and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like that , as if the movement from the IT sector would come and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
&quot; it was brought into life to ensure that some plant species and -@@ gene is not being protected as intellectual property , and so for plant bree@@ ders are permanently usable . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the initiative , shortly Os@@ si , U.S. bre@@ eder can also commit themselves to freely use the seeds . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; bree@@ ders allow only others to breed its seeds , to breed , and it is not immediately utter@@ ing - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plants . &quot;
do@@ zens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ated professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Os@@ si @-@ Board Member of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seeds plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would attempt to breed the latter or only little by employ@@ ing seed with natural res@@ ili@@ ence . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not employed with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables , cor@@ n , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological agriculture , &quot; he says , and particip@@ ates in the increasingly common f@@ usions of chemicals , such as food markets , should also know that the way that vegetables are bred , such as vegetables are bred . &quot;
&quot; nutri@@ tious without seed , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to providing other seeds at their disposal , and in contrast , its action in contrast to patent seeds and plant characteristics should be patent . &quot;

&quot; Os@@ si @-@ Sup@@ por@@ ters argue that the future of food supplies is endangered , since the available indoor swimming pool because of increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always available , un@@ read@@ n@@ urs@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her doc@@ toral work with gene@@ tically variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . it was found that about one third of all card @-@ characteristics are protected as intellectual property , thereby making it available for plant bree@@ ders either at all or only accessible . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there is such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ built plants such as wheat in even bigger styles are patented as salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are so bred that they have targeted them - of such , by which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they prosp@@ er in particular environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is increasing by more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently necessary but unnecessary , since the changed conditions is much worse due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that intellectual property rights other bre@@ eder because &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ets are promoting &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow , as soon as the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions can help others with another method to come to the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it to be made available by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees that differently : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ ose , will certainly make no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have been waiting for such a long time to grow plants , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions we have already lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general practitioner , and we should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their job easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be made impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in all , Mor@@ ton has bother@@ ed about the concept to patent for plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as bree@@ ders we finally give no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , Plant Bre@@ eder in the US @-@ State Oregon and Os@@ si pre@@ board member , there is still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breed is also his own values in them . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with great cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ ists , for whose cultivation of mass @-@ bi@@ zi@@ de are needed , in his varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; my concept is very subtle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( those who are moving on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents possess patents , do not create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents , either lean it off or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant @-@ hand Frank Mor@@ ton is looking out in his refuge from Sal@@ ads .

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the A@@ void of Plant Pat@@ bers : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than company . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue as I know that my competitors normally sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected from competition for 20 years , making it very easy to make it very easy . &quot;
&quot; though the US may seem to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , but the concept was rapidly spread out all over the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed , and sell their own . &quot;
&quot; the German Association Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; license , which ultimately constitutes a formal and legal form of Os@@ si commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot;
( rules for breeding does not differ from country to country where the Os@@ si @-@ obligation cannot simply be one of one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission , explained that conventional plants are not pat@@ ent@@ able to pat@@ ent@@ able plants . this is reflected against the current practice of the European patent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a statement is not yet a law ; it is now on governments of the Member States to implement the sponsorship office , this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems in Ethiopia , in the farmers , operators of seeds and seed companies from all of East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , that the organization is currently a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official launch . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental protection and development laboratories ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity in the world around the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food and other - a report published . in this , it represents that farmers have the opportunity to work on seeds and to shape the seed of seeds , so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si is hoping to see him soon more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly respected , where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to cl@@ eat the humans , that even more behind their foods are . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still bul@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
&quot; this time , it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on weekends on August 5 , the Egyptian government has documented the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) which documented human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about sel@@ dom . &quot;
&quot; August , the network released an opinion on Facebook in which it has critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and spoke to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remained consistent , despite this attack and def@@ ender of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , who want to aband@@ on freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to overcome the blocking and not admit it . we insist on to fulfill our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first app@@ alled website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities released over two months 21 web pages , such as bom@@ bing the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ v , arab@@ o @-@ speaking edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era because of &quot; &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to the blog of the Colom@@ bian and human rights research , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no access to Egypt &apos;s blog . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spreading of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles that he does not write in Egypt with common websites and media .
&quot; now the blog which he set aside to deal with the ens@@ ory apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider where also dom@@ ic@@ adas blog is native , but is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity after being arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video , like the police force physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article mainly turn around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; on a Facebook @-@ comment , Zi@@ ada on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means to him : &quot;
&quot; to block the blogs are very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blog is not significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a judicial system ; an attachment to a attempted murder , un@@ loading of the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I have not written for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to deal with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
&quot; however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way up to an end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ink and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) sper@@ r@@ ting Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06@@ th of August 133 websites . this takes technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented also the blocking of vendors , by changing the boarding house and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( VP@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we attended the blocking of websites that offer VP@@ N@@ s . &quot;
such a practice points to the intention of the government to continue to block and filter contents to the Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation in addition will wor@@ sen that the ens@@ ory choices have been made behind closed doors , which the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using which to proceed against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day to day report papers across Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard theme . &quot;
some of the head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is killed , &quot; &quot; Di@@ eves rough Ph@@ armacy by military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ ples sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air wash@@ ers to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation the certain@@ ties of 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years .
&quot; the United Nations , the Brazilian government of Global Justice had even called the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; reports such as these are all@@ every day , and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper . &quot;
&quot; this has published the report for detailed reporting on violence in Rio &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; on 16 August . this is not normal , in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in any major city in the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sex bur@@ ial and what happens only in Rio in the heading &quot; War in Rio &quot; . ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the paper , that this decision was not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
&quot; extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world , with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war . &quot;
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the paper explains that it will be controlled according to the institute for interior security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
in the editor the newspaper writes further :
&quot; we are aware that there is a war , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police that sho@@ ots only and then asks questions to tu@@ alize . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and fighting against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; mean more than it ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , descri@@ bing the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibilities with the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - such as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and self @-@ counter@@ ing negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember , the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital . &quot;

&quot; call Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent data available . &quot;
none of these cities is in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ate for each federal state , Rio is on position 16 , &quot; writes them . &quot;
&quot; extra is owned by the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , which highlights as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state . &quot;
&quot; these safety @-@ political measures belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a Fav@@ ela by making use of a massive police officers and to operate an entity permanently . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this did indeed lead to a break@@ down of violent deaths . for some years now , the U@@ PP has led to the poor commun@@ es and repres@@ sions against the poor communities who should actually protect the newly created police officers . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the name &quot; civil war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; besides legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war is also serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; for this calls upon the state to dep@@ loy resources and ways that are typical for a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; with which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; and &quot; gener@@ alized &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her , fact is that the people of the Fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
&quot; one week it is now that the police merge the mountain with the Fav@@ ela jack@@ et zin@@ ho , in order to tra@@ j@@ ure the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence he also made this incident head@@ lines : an orch@@ ard died as a result of shots , that the police had been diver@@ ted from a helic@@ opter . &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Sy@@ rer to plant mushrooms

source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal attacks and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime of loy@@ alist troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization P@@ ax and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib at present around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the east of Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly strong , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 has made the life of hundreds of civilians on August 21 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the mass@@ acre was carried by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels have been controlled from re@@ bel controlled areas outside of Damascus , which resulted that inhabitants are dependent on local or through tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; in return , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can produce their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ mer@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms does not belong to the traditional ones in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food loss makes them an attractive food source for many citizens of the besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Direct project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we op@@ ted for cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting for this project for three years , this project was well @-@ known and op@@ pressing its relief that it is now gaining more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ eria as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to the plant@@ ation of pilgrimage , so Dr. Lei@@ la &apos;s Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have achieved over 100 % of their expected target of about 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to raise funds from Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 . September 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the fuel shortage , local fuel is used from plastic materials to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production &quot; from the regions of the country , before they checked their quality and whether they are used to eat . &quot;

Portuguese calls for justice for victims of the fires of 2017
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts of the capitals in Portugal , and called justice for the victims of fires , which r@@ amp@@ ant the north of Portugal in the week before . &quot;
two forty @-@ two people were killed and about 70 were in@@ ju@@ red as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the region of G@@ ali@@ zi@@ en in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it estimates that there were more than 500 fire@@ ings , spread in the northern and central regions of the country , and reached around 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande is a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European surveillance system , which monitors the forest area by satellite photos , alone in 2017 in Portugal approximately 500,000 hectares of forest burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the sever@@ ity of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; throughout Portugal , the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a &quot; ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15th October , 2017 &quot;

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting policies .
people asked why civil protection was unable to em@@ as@@ ham@@ ed the scale of the tragedy as much as possible
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al from the Bund der Landwirte of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o the streets and villages were evac@@ u@@ ated for everything and nothing .
&quot; on this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are stupid reports of open streets , which were enclosed by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have been going back as in June , since the streets were very late closed . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction @-@ authorisation will be questioned with a high risk of fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a broad proposal for the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which has brought the government to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was attacked by the municipalities which saw new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the applicant , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ doors , so that everything was built , led JoÃ£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization &apos;s cross @-@ cus was attentive to that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees from easy bur@@ sting wood , as is still spread in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; among these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal is coming from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as resident information sought or tried to contact persons , offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative , which provided the population with information : they used the own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ org@@ .@@ pt , and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developers JoÃ£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was held on this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the server followed , not with@@ held the site more than half a million per@@ missions . &quot;

&quot; during a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
two years ago a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so was Afghanistan to a land of terror and desp@@ air .
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say it then , she knew her son would no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot;
in the dawn the boy should break .
his un@@ cle would pick it up and bring him to the sk@@ ew@@ n .

Abdu@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari the leader of the army of Haz@@ ara dominated the army of He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ soldier had just been murdered by the Taliban and many ha@@ ara were suddenly felt .
the Taliban known for their hat@@ red to the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara lod@@ ged the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a couple of years in a cohesion . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left out of his little wages , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and to@@ wing s@@ acks with mort@@ ar who were more difficult than he himself to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of af@@ gh@@ thouse refugees in Iran was affected by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , rec@@ alled A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an existing building on the job@@ site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we key@@ ed n@@ ylon in front of the open windows that we don &apos;t er@@ ors at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the dangerous crossing of the sea , he exp@@ ires ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ and@@ ete on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had refused its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time dor@@ shar@@ af was homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church , distributed twice a day eating on aid needs . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high loading rates a kind of second chance for ex@@ ited asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; it is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers may only be assigned to an exceptional center if they officially submitted an application for asylum - what can be prevented after the registration of the asylum @-@ book still monthly . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , rely on the hospitality of friends or must sleep on the street . &quot;
so it is also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his inno@@ cent of living helped as@@ ham@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions soon .
&quot; after several years he had done various works in the building unit , St@@ shar@@ af tasted its entire savings into the establishment of a youth hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a schn@@ elli@@ ete .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; behind Venetian ) luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
the film won the Venice City Award for the first time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the path to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afghanistan has emerged company , including cut@@ ters , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some af@@ gh@@ ten restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi and Greek courts , the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneurs Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets then reach far beyond the Italian restau@@ rat@@ e@@ wer@@ be and retail stores and aim to go back to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , also means possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af for@@ ged plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ ative techniques . &quot; this way they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful business was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af did this journey itself . now , he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans . &quot;
Ne@@ ti@@ zen &apos;s report : legislative powers from Egypt enable dis@@ ing social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , since more than 900 days in jail . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearance of the Lag@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the replacement of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen &apos;s report is an international snap@@ shot , the challenges , victories and upcoming trends in global internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament has reviewed a draft law , which means that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government agency . &quot;
users would have to use to be able to use social networks within six months after the successful legal framework on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as its publication number .
&quot; those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment , or the dem@@ nity of a pen@@ al payment . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty parliament@@ arians , is currently negotiating the legislative as well as the constitutional Committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; May another member of the parliament had a leg@@ is@@ diction , which would be introduced to the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the pres@@ idents of the President or of a senior officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law the har@@ ass@@ ment of the President as well as state institutions have already been pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the law proposal there would be such an act with pris@@ ons and money pen@@ alties , as legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would have under@@ gone a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been at risk for many years . &quot;
&quot; an striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , when it demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military put@@ sch , who had elected President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited so as more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested in det@@ ention with the same incident , four years in det@@ ention on one occasion . &quot;
recently his trial was recently moved on the 20th May because the Pr@@ ison guidance according to human rights groups was introduced to bring the accused of prison in the court room .
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty because of a , so many human rights groups agree , the floo@@ ding of among other weapon @-@ ownership , illeg@@ ally gathering , murder and tried murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iza also talked the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block at the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdu@@ ll@@ ah al @-@ Fak@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist for sc@@ anned documents
&quot; in May the Tunisi@@ an authorities six hours with the trial of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is the co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been driven primarily to a sear@@ ched plan of action . poss@@ essed plan dates back to the President of the Republic and according to the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption accused am@@ nest@@ y would ensure that these all un@@ ri@@ ghtful funds will be with@@ ered .
&quot; that published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , thro@@ ws a light on how the prepar@@ atory plans look for support of legislation . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia reject the attri@@ bution of his sources under st@@ ating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press conference which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he stood at the District Court in Tunis on 09 . May as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China comp@@ el the users of social media to submit their credit card ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the Information Technology Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China to write or share messages in social media . &quot;
the rules will also be stated that the registration with the full re@@ els name will be required .
&quot; an@@ al@@ ysts susp@@ ect that this is to be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities apply these regulations .
Chinese networks have proposed in the social media to achieve these regulations only selective in order to protect public journ@@ alism and independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
May St@@ aying the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia into access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ nad@@ z@@ or fo@@ amed We@@ chat , to register with the provincial government as the &quot; organizer of the information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is part of a law dating from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government introduces a list of online services that will organise the &quot; publication of the Information &quot; . &quot; the law allows the government to assume responsibility for the removal of content and force them on request for sending user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently on sites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ graf@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and frag@@ rant of other services . &quot;

&quot; a Turkish court had the blocking of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administr@@ ators found themselves to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the information that support Turkey support the jiha@@ dists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication gave to , the site was locked because they work together to &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups in order to fight a political de@@ am@@ ination campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey blocked the website completely blocked . it is thus , in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
