<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American films, played an American music, American authors read and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"when 14 years old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican's letter, a terrible reporter, who covered the highest Bundesministries of a oil-magnates that were overoccupied by his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," "me it was, as if that is the absolute truth, it all is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only reinforced."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting, that you are always that you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very warmer love of love about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his bottleneck.</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never keeps on the mountain behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague expressed it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted for him in favor of him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million voices that he won at the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number that nominee a nominee of the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these bigot person I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to reconcile up Trump and his voters to reconcile his voters in Phoenix for my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of Journalism Programme, which took people from all over the world, a deeply sadness that I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Trumps World illustrates not with the Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met us in our common love for basketball, and we spent a lot of hours to watch the" "Phoenix First" "in play."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity that I lived with Sandy Bahr, who lived their lives long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she fits to the engagement of Kristi Cappes, who always fits with a lot of patience and grace, and helped me to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there was Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot with my career."</seg>

<seg id="29">"while the Trump has set his way to the nomination of Republican presidential data, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of his restricted vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">However it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly wives, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against not-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people have voted for Trump, because they have either shared their racism and fanaticism, because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump's voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficial and respectful and indicates a inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters have been voted for Trump, because they would like to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick to raise the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt on those who look differently from it."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" "(m.).: so much as" "elongation of the White against all other ethnicities", "worshiping from white in references to the white and whiplash as it was the great Van Jones, has exactly been killed that America has made so great."</seg>

<seg id="100">"in West Africa, then it was known that this ship had already been operated in liberated waters of illegal fishing fishing, before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly brought up in this way and little inclined to welcome a criminal crusher of this kind in its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised himself quickly against the ship. they refuse to share one of their ports and refuse to share him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursuddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply lingered everything, "" Benedict Kiilu, a leitner of the Kenyan-fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed. "</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to looting of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegale fisheries stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that were expelled from their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it is about illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden, why it is extremely difficult to get up. thus, the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing from regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"intentional abuse of existing laws, through which certain habitats and types are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm a delicate equilibrium."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while action against illegal fishing was once more hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail, with the information between individual countries, so the actions happen nowadays in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries, for example, share lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that can be noticed or experienced during a port of port."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive, if they move at the open seas, by satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to detect the authorities, ships that are fishing in harassed areas. there are so dispared driving routes, such that a ship charges the fish along the way on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"idealdiarrhea may show such investigations, whether the ships involved have a broad license, where they were on the move and possibly whether they have a penance register."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, can refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports. what means that the ships will not sell their charge. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner, meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, leitner director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the mentioned platform was created to attract more than 20 million USD (previous sales), which lose the eight members of the network HISH-i each year due to the illegal fishermen that enter into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna-fish to attract the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"among other practices include actions, such as the sailing of false flag, fake licting papiers, specification of phantasies, fishing, protected species and the fish in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they are targeting the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-consistent control system, "says Long." "previously, a ship could have illegally fish and a country could then say 'You did not stop my harbour."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Komm to me'. 'and this legal hach tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks distributed in Tanzania the fake licenses used in Tanzania. it discovered ships that have been pursued multiple fraudulent identities and found it volved ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authorities to combat crime, FISH-i information is able to share information on illegal fishing over big distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime, "" says Bergh. "</seg>

<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite staff, which is always further developed, also helps to hide the illegal ships that are like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, Editor-analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be registered by satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system that connects various information levels with each other. it aims at ISH-i to help criminally ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model-program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team can actually influence the global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch, the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that can satellite reception data and by which the position of each single traceable ship can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join forces with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - that is simply sense, "" says he. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "pew Charitable Trusts have a similar project to run, in which a global system the persecution of ships are permitted."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals but they can also be deterred.</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that used earlier without licence, and hardly to reckon with consequences, now know that they will be observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participated in the meantime a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats for more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia that had helped Greko 1, the spectors found there on board strap, whose use is prohibited."</seg>

<seg id="147">"other countries also notice this success." "the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa annually disappear several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries joined together in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. also, they now fight against illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i." "the aim is to create more such initiatives and structures also in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member states had his first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship which was travelling under falsely flag. and not just was the ship used without a license and were called Tueppnets that are now banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into deserted waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures to Greko 1 put a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a particular, collaborative way of protection for the protection of the oceans actually works in the whole cosmos.

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to use, you need two important skills: passive safety skills to understand the starting-text and use active language skills to transfer him into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with mother linguists. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - do not be in the pronunciation of motherlanguage."</seg>
<seg id="379">"thus, a French mother tongue, for example, should be translated from English to French - not from the French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ no employees with English as a mother tongue to produce translations into English. this may result in a lack of understanding of survival, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers, to learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that even do not have foreign employees, have translated translation into the company. then, the Japanese employee, whose English skills are made as the best one translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good."</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrenen and enigmatic movements are created by machine translations that this technique can not replace any human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, who often decorate T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>

<seg id="694">The original workshops were directed by the Pedagogues David Hodges that lives in Montreal and lived in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is increasing for the young participants in discussions such as" cultural identity, language, discussion, love, self acceptance or whatever comes in mind. "</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the kite calendum First nation in British Columbia, is also called the Highway from the tears," a street section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.

<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation was shot, the chorus is sung to Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here were a little help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip Hop Group who gave them a Strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree lieh.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebookside of N'we Jinan is available the Strophe in Transcription, as well as translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports in reports and foreign media on the" "struggle against Drug Trade" "in Mexico, the internists and slicates regularly emerge only in statistics. however, these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy against this struggle."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa-Kartells, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict totally in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, there is hardly anyone looking at the grape or the communes who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"at the same time, behind every body, behind each bone was discovered in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds might never cure."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político is the digital project" "Aprensa Vivir Con El Narco" "(German:" "with drug wholesale" ") to give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories of people who grated the struggle between criminal enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime cannot be fear about our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The impact is much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if business close, because they are threatened by drugs retailers and whole churches therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">Pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear lives") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"one main character is Guadalupe, a father, who is in each weekend secret tombs after his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, which in just one day lost her father, her four brothers, her husband and two of her nephew."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" like every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the task that we have put forward, go and go to graves, according to the people whom we loved. "</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>

<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but they do not get paid out, because that require a death-certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprena vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we do not only have to show the faces of those who are to be afraid of. we must show the international community the conflicts, the break and the government."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high risk-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a writer of Animal Político, wrote this post from taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>

<seg id="782">"sometimes, I feel as if I am the only thing that shook or sad. it acts like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body once belonged."</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent at this time or regard this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he is big (German: drug dealers) will be that he is great. and it is also not normal that people listen to the" heroism "of the offenders, if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me that is, as if they were those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they may happen."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are to blown numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insomnia of the people is incredible to me when the death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students are justified in a neighboring village that they were "revolved."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to speak that they are spared by such tragedies when they are not stirred and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution" Four months blackmail in the Hauptstadtdistributions: like a family with drones, it describes how armed criminals had been destroyed by their business till they ended up not only the business but also their family apart. "</seg>

<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the post "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the violence marked by force."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction he raises questions on how: who cares about the child of a missed woman and a man, who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Liise and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make a egg cooks which makes Tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies which is with him. this is his name for the preparation of flags with water, sugar and milk powder. "</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year's life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood has been over two years before, when he was just a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father saw that shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">As Bryan was born the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mornings according to the public safety and government of the United States government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecutor of the 3103 Morde. this corresponds in the incision 8,5 Morden per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">"these are just a few of thousands of thousands of stories, that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and invade it into the soul of the country."</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories still live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those that we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" "Aprensa Vivir Con El Narco" has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to portrayed the complex information behind the failed fight against drugs that has been tormented by the country over the past four decades. "</seg>

<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after having started with this work, the IS had to put everything on it, this architecture that embodied not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the net because it enthused the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people ostindian origin or generally used as an adjective."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" Kalar "or to become a part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalistic movements of the word has given an extremely remote konnation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"specifically, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight the hate speech in Myanmar, the company has set a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar'Kalar, it may usually be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically calls themselves to hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word, or expressed a doubt of his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with fundamental meanings that have the same letter like 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters, as well as other words as' Kalar PAE '(camerse),' Kalar oat '(Kamel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuses Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he enthused the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends on a spiritual nature, whether they knew how he could linnen his back pain, as he did his back-play."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" healing "(ku) + the Frageword (la) at Burmically - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"zin Win Hout is the opinion that they will reduce hate speech radicalal nationalists, but he also stressed that Facebook provokes all posts who ignores the suspicion of racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you write on facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example" Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar PAE "</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that this dreamer nationalists, the hate speech spread, a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcised its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all, the hate speech may not spread long, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have demonstrated that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat- and mouse game, using the users of social networks simply to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the restricted word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described, as Facebook began to delete his posts as he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' of the social network is banned:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">... "when I was attentive to this new Directive on Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically my post was removed from Facebook to me, the songwriting, post and parts of content for 24 hours is prohibited because the post" Facebook Community standards unmet. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or which simply try to show their opinions against the Hassan radial nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the letter, the author divided his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community around Council:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Words to censor such words will only add more hate in the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and so words like" "chair" "or" pevercurry "." "</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they tried not to right the miserated posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Comebooks automatic censorship made for a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make use of Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots from Facebook-Posts who have no hate speech, but nevertheless removed:"</seg>

<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used to expand the social networks to expand their voices and their influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech should be forced into social networks into the communities in Myanmar in addition, particularly in the area of Rakhine, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists were forced thousands of people."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was responsible for its failure to bring out the warms of Hassan on its Burmish pages under control.</seg>

<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women are avoiding great care to speak the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh to respect women because of social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should abuse the norm in order to put this practice in life."</seg>

<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas worked for seven years with the help of her Videokamera to uncover practices, such as children's marriage up to the execution of HIV- and AIDS-infected members, and heads those clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reported how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made for ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed up in her discussion, was meant by women who don't call her husband on behalf."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to speak out the name of their husbands, there is a Brother that keeps them alive and never put into question."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini thinks:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not hold this, is regarded as deposited, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, which has never called her husband before on the name, try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>

<seg id="1491">My mother-in-in-law and my husband remained for a long time after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate ". some believed that there is a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women were protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the Round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video project, the women tried to get the discussion with a exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, despised, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want, means that they cannot respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought to her husband's name on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the Brechen of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women may never be able to pronounce the name of her spouses. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during all the exercise just before moving; another chose to let the whole phalted frustration against him and his family by taking it away.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenalin rush about it, with an ancient fires, the women decided that they were actually trying to name their husbands with the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a wife called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she was stubborn, she got afraid and said that there was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said, I meant to do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation in violence was less understanding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reported how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the galvanic red dot on the forehead, which indicates the marriage:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the galvanic red point if he was doing it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs and I heard it to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not fully end up with it, but they think they are now in a better position to choose itself, not to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we do a trip at any discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to worry about who what could hear," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced, and spoke about things, about whom they had never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and I also have some things, for example how our identities are made to our husbands, have never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only bore Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most this is okay, but some wanted a salem-curta to carry a wide shirt over a pants, they have not dreamed."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of your own closeup, morals connected to the Saris and much more, jewellery-yellow Rohini their own couple of curry (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they have decided now to plan a trip to Goa where they can carry Jeans and Rohini is sure to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"at the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion is already changed, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have done small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then listened to the name of her husband's name."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do not make it yet, but only if they are alone and not the other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now bear in their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the soleming around more freedom of movement or their own closeup - at the end of a difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families, there will be a chain reaction when any woman goes back home and told others about what we are talking about and what we do."</seg>

<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly as Singapore is recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however according to the Minister of Minister of Shangrgam, Singapore should be considered as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at a meeting of the international subsidiary of the Bar Association of New York, the Minister of New York marked the Ministers that a lot of people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because it was in Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>

<seg id="1694">"the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," to rotate logic "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrificing to create this valuable country, we will say that we ultimately cannot be a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of a flight in front of the responsibilities, a mandatory hurtment."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons given by Shangrgam were not very nobles: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other" normal countries, "given that he appeared inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in contrast, it defends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old Leier of the authoritarian rulers appear to be the preceding logic, as it fits better to their power."</seg>

<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng calls for Shangrgam to show his opinion, as they did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>

<seg id="1707">"short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very thankful when our flour K Shangrgam would take the effort to clear this point where he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"on the blog posts his comment, he points to the reviews that you should begin to understand the entire co-ordinance of the conference so that Singapore could better understand the context of the statements of Shangram, according to which Singapore was a city, and no country."</seg>

<seg id="1711">"as he said that Singapore was rather a city" "be as a country," "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequally important, even if we enjoy free and fair elections."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He is in Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party?).</seg>

<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shangrgam, a member of the new generation of political leaders from Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that he really believes is what he defended."</seg>

<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the dawn meets the room" .Raus with you, Arschficker. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answered with the voice of an exhaustive youth:" "my master, my Father has to worry about fearful worries."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be silent and beaway you, you will be moved."</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jamordal Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speak about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was recorded by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the most of his time inside; times he mueners on his canvas, once again his computer, back and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"what one can rely on, however, is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotted lips to discover."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which has been part of them since 1967; in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs families had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine, where she lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for now six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression by art and rapids."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music that often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues can not only be found in his native town of Amman Relevance but also in cities that suffice from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa at Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with its 25 years of age, Hdaib sees himself as someone who can't be restricted in his mind, and he can feel his own testimony with the people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not openly exist, he defeated a special appeal against the US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe its compassion for those who attempt to survive in war zones, anything but what he was born in war, even if he was born in Jordan, and so far has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own living conditions," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so because I am a man" "while he shook into two cups in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The law also says that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with urancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sensing hot jitag has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the swarm coffee and the sayings of the kent-cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when one throws a view into the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"so it avoids easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during the Ramadan water, in order to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently the Interior of Jordan has said an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"a few MPs, supporting the Islamic action on the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts of Hamed Sinno says the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert series."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former spokesperson of the Islamic coalition of DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was" just "just because of the sexual orientation of the scary."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also assert that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that questioned the Ancient and authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila the jordained people as a" progressive supporter of human rights "that continue to work for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement may not be easy for seizing rhetoric, but in fact an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan will reflect that in Hdaibs work clearly appears."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016 Hdaib traditional gender astormen came to Leibe, having made his vision of the fate of Arab women, which have had sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of an apparently crushed unfamiliar woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who have actually trust them.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years the number of 'honorary assassination' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak in 2016; however, that Jordan is still missing that Jordan has turned the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted to support victims of murder and domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on shocking control from the year 1954, women who are exposed to intra-familiar violence, and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as guarantee on the part of the family that the woman has nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is known for it, also not to retreat from issues that are long in the country for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib argued that his work is politically, however, is a fact that he is his music, which is full of explicit attacks on sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was denied politics," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "Lawla al 3aib" "and" "Ghareeb" "lies in the focus on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of the songs, which are politically politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words," that is what you want "- be faith or non-faith, heterogenic or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality of LGBTQ + -individuals were still sharply seated in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordained Onlineprogramm Roya, to remember later that his comments were torn from the context, revolves and his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but they were only a processed version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib drives openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intolerance against homosexuals do not meet the Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuts, a poet from the eighth century, who is still alive today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks themselves: if Abu Nuwhat, who would later work on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century openly about homosexuality could do, why can Jordan that not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemite Kingdom, there is nothing new to say that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordained message company collaborated several former governmental organizations and members of the teacher association, with the reasoning, they have expressed themselves on comments in social media and criticized with deep in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert Hdaibs believes that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan, Mashrou'Leila now sees a appearance for the second time - consists of slow, bedding and internation changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the jordani society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreaming not only of his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"maybe the region is going to work with music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, aspiring and artificial democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is, Hdaib will continue to resist and therefore also resist resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the processed version of the paper" "love-makers at guerrilla warriors", "which has released the international online magazine Tea after Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">This entry will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we just write attention to people that we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel outgoing with affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question went to the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation of BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation not more from the head and inspires them to the Campaas por la Reconciliación (letters for reconciliation) to write the young people to write guerrilla's letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"just before the short time, her country was the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guerrilla FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces in Colombia), which forms the slender of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally the signatal of the peace treaty was considered as significant, that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">But in front of the Colombian people there is a long way to talk about a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"grilled damper who lived for many years in illicines, having been exposed to a war of war and around the clock to trusts their weapons, now they have to integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, which had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases has accustomed to guerrilla warfare, it must now take into its ranks and support them to build a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join forces and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people are written - love-ships to former guerrilla warriors to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla warriors that should then be passed on to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters for reconciliation was created at the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, which was held in February 2017 in Bogotá. there, Leonardo and Cristian the possibility of speaking shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"he explained that we love the people who love to write on Valentine's Day, thousands of love letters, but those who need much needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plane, he respoke to share his love with people this year, who needed more urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus, the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC, who now have their place in society and establish a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is present in all major towns of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I have never thought, that someone would forgive me"</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over in one of the UN warehouse in the Caldono region in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana takes place in Cali, two members of the Municipal administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation of BogotArt, in order to bring the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of FARC placed so on as they did earlier, in order to take the orders of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no precepts, but letters of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all parties." it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in-between, "" the political knowledge of Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former fighter carried me through the camp of the Guerilla-fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla warriors live), I saw a guerrilla warriors that wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to come down, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-Granatdesigner, a lethal weapon in the thorn-sheep."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I still spoke him and asked," "Hello, what do they have just?" "he answered," "I answered a letter that someone wrote me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, so I quickly responded to it. I suddenly had the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I strongly impoverished him and sat down beside the pomegers.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was pity also he was pity to be all the years of faithful companion of this struggle and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from hunger." I have never imagined that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now, I know that there is a society outside, waiting with open arms to us."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I just learnt as I have to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"now where peace is reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the opening, students and some leaders of the FARC entered a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised up as war and the FARC already prevailed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leader of the FARC, the history of the organization, its ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process:" many years long, we have experienced how social injustice through the state of Colombian people have emerged, we can help us shape society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who had never been hearing never before and had no electoral law, and to recognize that the people that I have often seen as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does me sore."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage, we can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the Commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">"Kolumbianern was made, that after the disarmament peace will reign."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to grasp the weapons and protect themselves for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we from FARC are now on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call for all defender of peace - regardless of what race, religion or ideology to belong to it - to rise above all that dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared a few of their experiences with us and talked about what happens in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered several months ago the international headlines, after reports have been published, which has been published the abrasion, torture and killing queer men in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"the first report was published by the journalist Elena Milazina in the Nowaja Gaseta; it cast a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, the suspected queer men strongholds and they in secret prisons in the gun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world,"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a Transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"even since their childhood, she sensed that she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she became growing, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which was why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chetschenen was experienced by the gender equality of her landlady, the hunting was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"because of fear for her life, they moved to the USA in the final analysis."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was active as an honorary assistant in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a acquaintance from Dagestan, a Transwife, which arose in difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I accepted her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her to help her, he made a friend of my documents and spread her all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his chechnyan friends, with the following message:" then there are no men more in Chechnya who can eliminate these shame?

<seg id="2260">Afterwards the photos of my documents made the round of my documents entirely by the WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>

<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"out of safety reasons I will not award their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it, without sign up, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it in the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checs into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a strangers.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't think about, you warmer in security, just because you have left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which hotel you do. you even know your immune number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my mould number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still stand in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about the gender equality however, that is a tabular topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kaucasian elements I still carry in myself.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So I wish to overcome this spiritual barrier I can not overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chatting with camera, I actually give me effort to see how the person reminds them of her past - so in my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what are your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the I needed current information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"I spoke with someone, the one and a half months in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut down a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"that is my I, they probably invite relatives before they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demanding a proof that the so-called" "honor" "experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now still stuck for men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a familiy from me says there was just not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then most of all those who have no rich relatives, or those of their relatives were dropped to face Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there, so that you can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be converted, you will show your body on TV and claim that they would have attacked either your village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply vanished, but specifically targeted to radiate themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a mutation or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just have someone who was detained for an and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown up beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new of them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so called Lord, that person himself was taken as these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, they were not presented as bandwidths so far, there have been no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have been allowed to shave this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if this persecution and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation," already in the past? "</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always contributed my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I believe in 2003 I was already known to Grosny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999 when the sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia was originally intended to lead us to the" civil "civilisation," but finally left us back to the Stoneage. "</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were wounded; I had colored eyelashes that carried smilijeans and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the sharia has never trimmed me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where each evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been sinned.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that said: "Spote is not about the unhappiness of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children if that make himself funny.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are ill?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never sinned, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this Gnat work hold?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister, he began to speak on morals on morals."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could sense how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had previously served and punched for he considered once again with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I was able to feel like the situation in the Republic is ever wasted."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"of this, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacup, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get Essenskarten."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not have a cents for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I found shelter.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: contribute to Hidschab</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is the nature that has nothing to do with religion at all.</seg>
<seg id="2384">"that is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who wish to prophesying you with foam before the mouth, that there is no oscillates with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the Kabardiner have which, the Russians, too, are they - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I am coming from there, therefore it is unpleasant for me to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">"here, there are so many men coming from the Caucasus."</seg>
<seg id="2388">"many of them - practicing Muslims, who go into the mosque and during the Ramadan, live together with males."</seg>
<seg id="2389">"know that many think in transience to men, men love, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a truction."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise, different environments."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be here personally but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi is suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination. "</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a large majority of those living in Iran live in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard to argue with the local Arab population."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy was taking power over and 1925 major efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields, as well as some of the richest and most valuable asset for the Iranian agriculture."</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website, in which many different positions were expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well-thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women today still earn less money than men despite the same education."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent observation when it's about what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women occurred sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex still moves through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I am suffering twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I get to speak on skin colour, on black CIS women, on black soil women, on black women in the LGBT community, or on black women from the Diaspora, as we have always been under racial, spiritual and verbal abuse, as well as outside the feminist movement, that many white feminists decide to be silent as well as in white intersectionale feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all women agree that women - all women - should come together to sing" their votes and 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about it, in addition to sexualised violence, an institutionalized form of racist violence that we are exposed to black women on a two-fold way."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin of origin are less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls with a migration background may be referred to school as a white girl because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres, and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand I will say that all women, all men and all men do not join any skin colour; on the other hand, I can consider myself as a black woman, to take into account the white woman who refuse to consider both the gender and the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and will no longer fight to fight my membership in a white-feminist-oriented spheres, which always rejected me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner urged 1851 in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and also I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalized being in historical respect."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join me to include groupings, which are also absorbing our customs and customs to advance its egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to lay white women the importance of overcuts of skin colour and gender, as some of them will continue to keep the meaning of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to imply them for better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectionale feminism was founded to give women a home from different cultures and to limit himself from the white feminism, still is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I think it was full of feminism and to join the movement of womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of fighting for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so stubborn, that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and embark into the spheres, which are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves to us, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered that the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling for separatism and exclusion, after they have read these lines, please refer to the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement by which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment I can emate black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I have existed."</seg>
<seg id="2464">"due to my dark skin and because of my existence, I was recognized as a woman as a part of this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black wife, can flowering in a environment where my life is neither escaped nor ignored."</seg>

<seg id="2470">"in this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa who explains us his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his church."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child," says Musa. "</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed for the protection of the person concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police showabar said Ada Báez, that she has nothing to do against Luis Balbuena, its export partner that has become violent towards violent."</seg>

<seg id="2484">"as another woman balbuena due to failures, the actenant display of Ada Báez did not take anything."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman drew its ad back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"when women are reviewing at all, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women also depend financially by the men that they mitigate. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence, to be in general at all law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content and Statistic 2 Unvisible abuses and a judicial system, which nothing subnimmed of Paraguay; good approach, lack of implementation and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women really misused," says Myrian González, research for genderquestions at Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">But the numbers available are very alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, at the District Court of 9600 ads went on account of domestic violence. at 70% of them it was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads made at the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were over 5,000 ads because of domestic violence at the peace court. here also 86% of the ads."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of the women, that they were physically healthful, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics are not showing the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayic women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these criminal offences are actually displayed only." on every woman who are refunded in Paraguay because of psychological failures, 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"to any woman who will be refunded because of body abuse, two women who do not do this," explained it at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's genocide in Paraguay have no own crimes, the prosecution cannot be appropriately documented how many women killed each year from their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016, journalists were at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay have at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible misuses and a judicial system that takes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez was the solid friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called her the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning, she did not want it, but there was something for ever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana 28 years old and no more have been together with Carlos. but two years ago she contributed the psychological force of violence against women and at the same time the most common form of violence against women and at the same time recognizes the most severe."</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never imagined that I would have been a victim of abuses.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read earlier, I always thought that only women are occurring that are to be submissive because they deceive themselves by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name name, she wrote articles on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he wanted them isolated."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered on their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric if he ever raised the hand against them, and refused to admit that his behaviour also had a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had taken this so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuses at least have a certain complicity to it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, which is not native by Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner they abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Network Yo te CREO ("I believe") that consists of women all in some way victims of misuses.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">You do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case all began with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"their wealthy partners finally managed to convince, to convince them that they were worthless."</seg>

<seg id="2589">"for the need for free medical research there are two reasons, such as a lack in the offer of global health being many drugs and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the poorest countries of Africa are far more serious effects than elsewhere, and lack of investment in researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, in setting up its own research funds in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr Ranjit Warrior is Director of the Center of Center for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com site, a magazine dedicated to solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as outfit, the first plant, which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA-Astronauts in Space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for nearly 20 years Morton's work was achieved only through his own ingenuity and the question, how many salutors can get, are set limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads were patented, and that he could not use it for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents vary not only to individual sorts, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green, or bent leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years more and more such patents have been submitted to more and more plants such as cereals or cartons. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representatives of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still salad, but now he needs no longer, since his work is growing ever more and more limitations."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as would lie in a river a rock socks, around which I must be swaddling."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go on salads too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they withstand before judgment, no one can breed any more of a new salads, because all characteristics are already patented." "he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he also connected a movement that is getting bigger in the U.S. and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding (" Open Source "." "</seg>

<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like that, as if the movement from the IT sector would come and not from the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "Open Source" "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was brought into life to ensure that some plant species and -gene is not being protected as intellectual property, and so for plant breeders are permanently usable."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the framework of the initiative, shortly Ossi, U.S. breeder can also commit themselves to freely use the seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." "open source" "breeders allow only others to breed its seeds, to breed, and it is not immediately uttering - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plants."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeriated professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Board Member of Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seeds plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to breed the latter or only little by employing seed with natural resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not employed with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to buy our goal of ecological agriculture, "he says, and participates in the increasingly common fusions of chemicals, such as food markets, should also know that the way that vegetables are bred, such as vegetables are bred."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"nutritious without seed, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to providing other seeds at their disposal, and in contrast, its action in contrast to patent seeds and plant characteristics should be patent."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi-Supporters argue that the future of food supplies is endangered, since the available indoor swimming pool because of increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always available, unreadnursed."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral work with genetically variation in carrots and their availability. it was found that about one third of all card-characteristics are protected as intellectual property, thereby making it available for plant breeders either at all or only accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there is such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-built plants such as wheat in even bigger styles are patented as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so bred that they have targeted them - of such, by which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they prosper in particular environments, and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeder is increasing by more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently necessary but unnecessary, since the changed conditions is much worse due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos and co-operation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property rights other breeder because" patents and the protection of plant varietets are promoting "." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow, as soon as the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions can help others with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it to be made available by the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees that differently: 20 years to wait, until a patent expose, will certainly make no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have been waiting for such a long time to grow plants, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions we have already lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general practitioner, and we should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their job easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be made impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in all, Morton has bothered about the concept to patent for plant characteristics:" we do not really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally give no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, Plant Breeder in the US-State Oregon and Ossi preboard member, there is still another important aspect of plant breeding:" who breed is also his own values in them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with great courtyards and monoculturists, for whose cultivation of mass-bizide are needed, in his varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"my concept is very subtle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (those who are moving on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents possess patents, do not create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents, either lean it off or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant-hand Frank Morton is looking out in his refuge from Salads.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder by the Avoid of Plant Patbers:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than company. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalogue as I know that my competitors normally sell my varieties in a few years," he says. "with a patent it is protected from competition for 20 years, making it very easy to make it very easy."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"though the US may seem to be leading in the" open source "breeding, but the concept was rapidly spread out all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"it also supports them to come to" open source "seed, and sell their own."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Association Agrecol works on an" Open-Source "license, which ultimately constitutes a formal and legal form of Ossi commitment to breeder in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding does not differ from country to country where the Ossi-obligation cannot simply be one of one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive committee of the European Union, the European Commission, explained that conventional plants are not patentable to patentable plants. this is reflected against the current practice of the European patent."</seg>

<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on" Open Source "-seed systems in Ethiopia, in the farmers, operators of seeds and seed companies from all of East Africa to learn something about the" Open Source "seed movement and the global trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
