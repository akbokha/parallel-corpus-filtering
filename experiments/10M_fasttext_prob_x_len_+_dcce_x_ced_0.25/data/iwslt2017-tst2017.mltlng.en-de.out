this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as the New York Times @-@ Times .
&quot; for a long time before the someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , the isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular , that the N@@ SA has illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence service in which the CIA was literally super@@ imposed on Iran for an atomic bom@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if the nuts sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an unbelievable story .
but do you know who the chapters not coinci@@ ded ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has been established against reven@@ ge and called on it to call its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this move , he became a symbol for the pattern of government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers and to pun@@ ish journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish the secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media does not get this information and if it cannot protect the identity of the disp@@ atch , which they give price . &quot;
&quot; so when the government went up at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous re@@ por@@ ters already did before him : he refused , and said he would prefer to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were for years of reference , that it would be crucial in their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring the Repor@@ ter and springs can always hide less .
&quot; rather than to fail and conc@@ ise lon@@ ged to the statements , that could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without prior consent , his phone numbers be secre@@ tly concerned , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit points , and even zip@@ pers with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to judge Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , an CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers and Ris@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama spoke with his lawyer , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments from him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of that a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; thus , we put the press work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional order , because the government has more and more possibilities to sp@@ y all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the technology of the government allows to handle the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they may take that from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ spect , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that had not been written as R@@ isen Book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mail or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source distribution system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , originally developed by the internet famous , which was developed by us Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation at which I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of mail an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; here you can upload documents or mail , just as with any ordinary mail form . &quot;
&quot; these are encrypted and stored on a server , with which the respective news agency access has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would require , would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ y technologies that all end@@ anger us . &quot;
&quot; it is to us to ensure that not only technology , such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to evi@@ dently express mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; the disp@@ ens@@ ation of ab@@ norm@@ alities at the care of soldiers knows and want to report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to be pushed for fl@@ int water from Fl@@ int . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ ders that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only for those who want to raise crimes , but to protect our full constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the greatest dat@@ l@@ ery of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that fri@@ che and powers are hidden in tax hav@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ate Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to an explanation . &#93; this week we were owned by news about a check of 11 million documents related in Panama &apos;s local law firm Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
islands &apos;s prime minister has resign@@ ed .
&quot; also , there is reports that a composite of the brutal dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad stamp @-@ firms in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia , President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be out there a lot of rich people and others who are nervous on the next release , and to the next revealed documents . &quot;
now this sounds like the plot of an agency gri@@ lled or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham .
&quot; it seems crying from you , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we address what ?
&quot; but the truth is : when the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians , how secret tax hav@@ ens are utilized by some few to hide and to wear -- something that we have been discussing and reve@@ aling it for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many men appears very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ ffs .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ ution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
presum@@ ably because there were so far no prominent Americans who arrived in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; however , by the principle according to which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we would have a backup of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to set up less information to found a company than to get a libr@@ arian . &quot;
&quot; this kind of in@@ consistency in the US has allowed its employees to zo@@ omed in school@@ children , school@@ children . &quot;
it has helped sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip especially an@@ di@@ spar@@ ate investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does that actually work ?
&quot; so , we sent a covered wr@@ apping into the offices of 13 An@@ wal@@ ts@@ firms in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ators found himself as an African Minister , bringing the suspic@@ ious money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really sho@@ cked , that all right up to a lawyer &apos;s couns@@ el proposals made , how he could trans@@ ate his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ clu@@ sters . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and naturally there has been given money to us . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this as an individual .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , which has under@@ lined our un@@ covered proposals . &quot;
it is not about a single top pol@@ ishing which is involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we have to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules in order to ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ate this kind of behaviour .
&quot; that may sound everything very tr@@ usive , as if we could do anything about it , as if nothing else had changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful ones . &quot;
but as born optim@@ ism I see that quite a lot has begun to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have witnessed more transparency regarding what the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
the issue found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU is recorded in central stops at the national level who truly is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a draft law in both parliament chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , as a means of use in the U.S. and globally for greater transparency . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
&quot; we need ordinary people , which are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the head@@ set . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy , which stand up and say , &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and work for it to end this kind of transparency .
&quot; together we can end the transparency , which now allows you to end this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering , finally end . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped , and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das were . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ stop . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained to stand and looked at my belong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and just made a road trip all the country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him on a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where sl@@ ing you today night ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing even worse , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what I am now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a bedroom now ?
&quot; but I just came to know him ! he says it would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ el . &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; then I heard myself : &quot; &quot; I have a air conditioning . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I was wander@@ ing to the blank@@ et and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I built into it ? &quot;
a game @-@ foreign sleeps in my living room .
what if it is crazy ?
&quot; I was given such a fear that I went out of the bed , on the ten@@ ly to the door , and my sleeping @-@ room door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork , which he had bought from me , depends today in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my perspective completely .
&quot; maybe people who were sold to me as stran@@ gers , actually friends , who only waited for it ? &quot;
&quot; when people are on my air mattress , he was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air@@ mat . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time lead , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my ro@@ ommate pull off and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe creativity can make it , anxiety in fun to transform . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new fellow inhabitants Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I promised how to earn something with us . our apartment will stay at a designer @-@ bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and breakfast each morning . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mat@@ tresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at a wooden loft with us for 20 dollars on air conditioning .
they found it super and we too .
&quot; I am sure to decor@@ ate our che@@ eses che@@ que O@@ mel@@ et completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
we travelled with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door into the castle fell to rigi@@ d Brian and I arrived .
did we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former fellow inhabitants , N@@ ate Br@@ arc@@ ado , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to see if you could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website , on the people publicly pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their b@@ aker -- the kind of room whose doors are completed when you visit . &quot;
&quot; through the Internet , they can invite them to join wild people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they are not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still very con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have all learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if one has a problem , you can get on the things that you can do . we were able to des@@ ig@@ nen . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create more trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make a difference ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a cost and what degree we would like to raise .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I like to un@@ lock that you un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ mistak@@ able mobile phone to your left seat .
&quot; this quietly trip from panic , which you are feeling now -- -- is just what hosts will feel when they open the door for the first time . &quot;
&quot; for the only one , which is more personal than your mobile phone , your home is home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
what does it feel about keeping the un@@ brid@@ ged mobile phone of a stran@@ ger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so who has now Al Gor@@ es &apos;s cell phone ?
could you declare on Twitter that he con@@ dense to the office of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we have changed a small detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour wouldn &apos;t have been presented with his name only once he does , where he comes from , how his dog or children are hot ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 b@@ ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents that all say : &quot; he really can count very well @-@ handed mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you &apos;d have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ driven feedback system rein@@ forces confidence .
at the beginning we did some things done wrong .
it was difficult for people to prevent negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both the host and guest had given their jud@@ gements until we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined , as probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence . &quot;
&quot; little surprise , we trust the people most , who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social responsibility .
exciting is it when you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents .
&quot; if you have less than three Be@@ es@@ sm@@ ents , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , but it changes . &quot;
a good reputation em@@ ishes simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ times atri@@ ots .
&quot; moreover , we also experienced that trust is dependent on how much you are doing . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; if one speaks too little as for example , &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells you , how for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the inquiry is also rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I have my family vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can I create design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on what subjects to write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our entire company builds upon hope that the right design can help you overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; with what we had not reck@@ oned , the great multitude of people , who were more than willing to present these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people are eligible for our offer .
you can see three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
&quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; thir@@ dly , a need for which previously was not covered . &quot;
for us business is just very good .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything is smoothly running . &quot;
there were guests who have been allowed to have been celebrated or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I collabor@@ ated with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing sc@@ lim@@ mer@@ it than those calls . it already hur@@ ts when I am only thinking of it .
&quot; the disappointment , which you hear in the voice of the tension , was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , of the 123 million euros , the nights had only a fraction of each problem . &quot;
for people trusted each other to justice .
&quot; if confidence works , it can arise wonder . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host was driving him to hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation .
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers , who tend to tend to stem cell activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Al@@ ej@@ andra are real protective angels who save one life , even though they don &apos;t know one . &quot;
&quot; driving one in your own car to hospital when you die dies , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want you to feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
you can even stay longer without charge extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay runs .
but these relations behind the pure money @-@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; when I met for the first time about this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is here about an economical trade .
&quot; but now it is just to call &quot; &quot; Rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
&quot; share Economy describes a trade , human relations promised . &quot;
&quot; people lay a part of themselves , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when one travel today , it is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but therefore less authentic . &quot;
what if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place we visited , a group there would be more announ@@ cing that there would be a thorough and to show one of a pub that has never heard before . &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to create apartments from reason to share ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would have the thought of mutual profit ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relations , instead of sol@@ itude and de@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; in South kor@@ e@@ as capital Seoul , this project has already been started . many parking places that were belonging to the government . &quot;
&quot; now houses were offered . students , who were in search of a lead , &quot;
&quot; were introduced to people whose children were killed . there were inc@@ ub@@ ators programmes , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , through our platform only € 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreig@@ ner or even the host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be not so crazy as it was put together .
we have not invented the wheel .
hospitality was also previously available .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why has it just worked ?
&quot; aside from luck and Tim@@ ing , we see that you can find the right design with the components of the trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deepest prejudi@@ ces .
I find the ast@@ o@@ unding as well
quite overwhelming .
I have to think every@@ time when a red Maz@@ da goes over to me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a gli@@ de ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or suppres@@ sed , a bra@@ in@@ washing under@@ wear , a terrorist attack ? &quot;
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I won &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee owner -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
an Mö@@ ller @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , for , Baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ sin@@ me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to carry Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head coverage . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friends were un@@ vei@@ led : &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lus@@ tige was : at that time there was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and on the pressure which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and unbe@@ atable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ alled with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought by , presented in question , dou@@ bt@@ ful and credi@@ ble . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow devotion to deep@@ ened with each reading of the cor@@ k .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to wines .
I realize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that anyone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow love ? &quot;
it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had at the end of my breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ ab@@ ort &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people disp@@ ers@@ ed out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock was rapidly changing in indi@@ gn@@ ation .
why should you do something ?
&quot; I switched on the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam , &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u turned me the acts of others from a civil war into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the US to move into a new city and start with the building .
&quot; I remember , as we were silent -- as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we moved at this night into our apartment , in a new town , where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , looked and read the war@@ nings of national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful , &quot; &quot; lead in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; Des@@ tru@@ sts do not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week in it .
then it was Friday at that week -- the day in which Muslims gather to bed .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of it .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims and of people who was holding for Muslims , into free and dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who have attacked this country to have attacked our country .
I have defeated the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
&quot; there are the accus@@ ations , which are hard . &quot;
&quot; today we can actually say people , &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when are we going on ? &quot;
some people want to join Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it just raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor you can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor one only keeps on observation .
the alternatives are useless because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , ear@@ chers and Olympi@@ oni@@ ken . &quot;
will the closing of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; it may keep a few parking spaces , but not the terror stop . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith , toler@@ ant , and to show greater citizens . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC , recently told : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; in the radical process , one has noticed that he will start online . as a first person , the person goes from their church , even by their family , so that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims and everyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and its ideology is a tra@@ itor , or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; some are still claiming , Islam is a non @-@ violent religion . &quot;
&quot; lastly , a group such as the IS is based its brut@@ ality with the Quran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves into the imagination , if one acknowled@@ ges them as a representative of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam such as the K@@ u club @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons in their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when one puts a look at it , it is not driving them what they are in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things in the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me recently an astonishing history :
a girl came to him because she would have imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . each cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of the injustice in the world , it would only bring in difficulty . &quot;
&quot; of nothing inspired and something that would have been given to her guard , she was a main objective for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised you a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam made the link to God and her church again .
&quot; instead of protecting her anger , he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , he kept it to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day based on our democracy ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show us : if we fear us , at least three things happen . &quot;
we accept an author@@ itarian governance system , con@@ form@@ ance and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; one study shows : if one has been telling messages about Muslims , in which negative about Muslims have been reported , it was more than military attacks on Muslim countries and the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; when looking at when the mood against Muslims h@@ oss down -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two elec@@ tr@@ ages .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public , in order to infl@@ ate the foundations of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early warning character .
&quot; perhaps we felt it as the first , but the toxic air of fear seemed to us all . &quot;
&quot; when entering a collective bar@@ gaining , it is not just about to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
de@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; he was at the dental surgery , talented , much promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , gr@@ aci@@ est man , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is of my Brü@@ der@@ l@@ ein , such an vers@@ ed young man become ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , which was in the afternoon when he was in her apartment , as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his fac@@ ebook page . &quot;
he took eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only moral but also fatal .
let &apos;s go back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or were we kept safe at home ?
&quot; we bes@@ to@@ es it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we left to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided to choose the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat we were silent , with high @-@ pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , sent me to . &quot;
the hall was fully filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement , thanks and was called our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , believers , and non @-@ believers who have come to interv@@ ene , but to assist us . &quot;
I have collap@@ sed this moment .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what are you choosing at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be on number safe ?
or will you join those who mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thank you beautiful !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thinking with dr@@ au@@ ght , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , dec@@ eive you not . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usually as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the biggest ever performed study about Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , in no respect I am an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people seem like an exception to the rule , then the rule is broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler , stands shortly before , a billion business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ disp@@ atch position in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; by rel@@ ying , flight devices reach high speed and spe@@ eding up in the very narrow room . &quot;
they can also build self @-@ efficient structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and to respond generally to nature laws . &quot;
today we would like to present you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system aut@@ op@@ om , it must know collectively , where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynam@@ ical tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a off@@ springs of our lab@@ s . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
any flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine the calculations on board which the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available at the highest E@@ ben@@ e , for example . &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter , &quot;
&quot; a leaf@@ let , which tries to hit two flies with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the down@@ ward trip efficient , much more efficient than helic@@ op@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters it can fluctu@@ ate , and has thereby great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of h@@ edge star@@ ters is that they are sensitive on turbul@@ ence such as wind blo@@ ws .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
&quot; the idea behind it is that the air is no matter in what location , the optimum position reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing . &quot;
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often introduce ourselves fundamental abstr@@ acts relating to the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for finding the answer to such a question .
&quot; helic@@ opter are known as machines with a thousand movable parts , which coinci@@ de , to harm you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pil@@ ots could fly away @-@ controlled flight devices , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear wall . &quot;
unfortunately we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner as a mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote device . it was invented recently .
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ ut@@ shell , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ci@@ der , no further actu@@ ators or contro@@ l@@ lo@@ wing area , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simp@@ y , the interior lives very much , so that it can be stable and move in space . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the rear . to bring it to the rock , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ eli@@ hood to throw it exactly when all watch , is low , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the Moon is a practice in genital sol@@ itude , this machine is here , the om@@ is@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ors , a exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
you see that it is only symmet@@ ric .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; through this , he will receive the extraordinary skill , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is filmed or even how it rotating . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of inter@@ active rivers from the eight prop@@ ell@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; some is imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly at the catch . &quot;
let &apos;s see that at .
&quot; if flying machines are to be part of our day @-@ day , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers machines .
these is in the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them together they are like a high @-@ performance squares .
&quot; however , a bit wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , electronics or a cordless -- can continue to fly the machine if restricted . &quot;
&quot; we will demonstrate that , by doing one half air@@ worthy . &quot;
the last demonstration is examined synthetic ra@@ ids .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic print . &quot;
we took the micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and provide them with loc@@ alizing technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no ceiling .
hopefully will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as dr@@ on wants to be on Broadway a flying lamp@@ shade .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types such as us lies the wage of development and creation .
&quot; it serves as memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures allowed to shape them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , is the icing on the cake . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; 1,3 years ago cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very far distant galax@@ y two black holes are getting faster , they turned so the mass of thre@@ ef@@ ace in a tenth of a tenth of pure energy . &quot;
this short moment bri@@ ghter them bri@@ ghter than all the stars along in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
&quot; however , they do not put your energy in the form of light -- &quot;
we speak finally of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time @-@ angl@@ ed itself and the universe explo@@ ded into the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago was just a majority of life on Earth .
&quot; since then , the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand with us at -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of especially brave -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- a giant laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ating black holes . &quot;
most they kept them crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized it as a mad gen@@ ies , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation was funded to its idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the Det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following time , the precision of LI@@ GO could considerably increase significantly , which improved the performance performance considerably . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is called Advanced LI@@ GO . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO was launched for a final test run to clear some smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational c@@ rank@@ shafts made by the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my to@@ d@@ sick father .
basically this was the fruits of my life @-@ work .
&quot; all that I had worked , is no longer science @-@ fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cists at MIT . he has investigated since 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their observ@@ atory signals , which however are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ utter in the plum@@ age of space and time .
&quot; when temporary , the wave will pull the room and his entire content is stretched in one direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; to illustrate , lectur@@ ers in courses of relevance theory often lead a properly al@@ ber@@ ish dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sty , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves is extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each one of us stretched out the waves of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is , 20 n@@ ul@@ ls after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st bi@@ um , we explained the LI@@ GO @-@ employee for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometer long laser detection , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ of the radius of a Atom@@ ic kernel . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are abundant . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are fin@@ alized , and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne has published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LI@@ GO . Scott claims , LI@@ GO is more than one ear than one eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial als , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; that is quite handy . for example , you can make a picture or a map of things by using the score of several points coming around you . &quot;
in tones is that different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that means you especially much . &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead we listen according to specific properties such as sound and pitch , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , now speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; du@@ el Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot produce simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by watching changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
&quot; at least , for LI@@ GO the common frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range . &quot;
&quot; so if we convert wave @-@ patterns in weakness , we can speak all the literally . &quot;
&quot; the gravity can listen to lau@@ ghing , can tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with what my colleague Scott has already been busy for a very long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not swi@@ vel holes , cir@@ cl@@ amp simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turn the two body very quickly , you hear the same circle with an additional sound change . that sounds like us : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@
&quot; it is a kind of movement of movement , shaped in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget - heard LI@@ GO Fol@@ low : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des sound &#93; J@@ em@@ and , who knows what he must hear , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which will turn around as quickly as the sticks of your bl@@ ender . &quot;
AA : consider us short what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the longest body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns that revol@@ ve around one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the remaining importance of LI@@ GO .
&quot; LI@@ GO has a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before . &quot;
&quot; on this way , we can listen to the space and invisible . &quot;
much in space we can -- virtually or basically -- not see .
&quot; a Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ th@@ ech stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about this .
&quot; the exciting physical processes occur however at the core , that is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ lic@@ on . &quot;
&quot; we will never see through , since these op@@ ak are . &quot;
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . the ur@@ b@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the al@@ ls , but we will never see it because the ur@@ b@@ ang is shining through its own glow . &quot;
&quot; with the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible , up to the start back . &quot;
&quot; the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we are never seen before and of which we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO took right in the first approach of things which we were not expected . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes as LI@@ GO them observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the sauce for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we brought forth out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circle of cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ at@@ ories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on Earth and in all .
because what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
mar@@ es with us .
thank you .
some time I tried an experiment .
&quot; one year long I would say anything &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; I was afraid of this . &quot;
&quot; no matter whether it made me nervous , me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say yes . &quot;
I wanted to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
I wanted to start with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared , I fear my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speeches to hold , my social anxiety -- Pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes , that my life changed deeply , on an unexpected item . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; kitt@@ ens , &quot;
as if she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; kitt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak . &quot;
&quot; she asked her once I could play with her , when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new attitude to my family . from there I vibr@@ ate to play with them again , as soon as you call me up . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I will always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am glad . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an intri@@ gu@@ ing side effect : only recently , I actually understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ were saved to play with my children my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am autor@@ ec@@ in . I think of things that awak@@ ened you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produced television .
I make television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for applying 70 hours program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; each programme offers hundreds of jobs , which previously did not exist . &quot;
the budget for one episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 millions of television , four hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which are simultaneously in production , four episodes , 15 episodes : Sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my TV series will run on Thursday night .
over the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts , which I myself created , and not just produced , so still ob@@ tr@@ end@@ lessly . I have to find time , really sti@@ lle , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories about it . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fire , which are around the world . &quot;
do you know who that still does ?
&quot; nobody , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I do not want to impress you with this .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author . &quot;
&quot; I say it to you , so that all of you who work so hard , if you &apos;re talking about a company , a country or a household , so you understand that I am not just sitting on the computer and f@@ antasi@@ zing , and it &apos;s true when I say , I understand that it &apos;s not going to dream with a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all the blood , everything blood , everything swe@@ at -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; if I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land from nothing .
&quot; it is , when I put troops on , as m@@ alt I on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; thus , we put a high tone , delivered a marathon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and uns@@ ett@@ ling , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ern@@ al , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a sums begins in my head , and it grows and growing , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a bu@@ stling street , I could always go on her . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I &apos;m giving them the sums up that I am writing to writing that writing gives me pleasure . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong that does it .
&quot; but the tot@@ als -- when I began working with television production , when I began working and working and working together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz ! &quot;
the amount is more than writing .
the amount is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sums of God is the voice of God in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sums of sums you have , then you cannot be different from the size . &quot;
&quot; feel , not unlike the size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is what you call the bu@@ zz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it is called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
I just know that I &apos;m not doing for failure and I just know that I love the sums .
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things at the same time , the more they see , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country , which I created , the Marathon , the marathon , the army , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the sums , the bu@@ zz . &quot;
I like this sums . I love the sums .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I only that sums ?
and then stops the bu@@ zz .
&quot; revised , exagger@@ ated , exagger@@ ated , expanded . &quot;
the sums stopped .
&quot; now , my three daughters to the truth are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to that their mother is a single work@@ book . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; Look , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
there are the children of a tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were dis@@ band@@ ed . &quot;
the sums of the engine was cl@@ ashed .
I loved my work no more . the engine was out .
the bu@@ zz did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans working , 15 hours @-@ day , did not practi@@ se , no Reu@@ ben , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan schl@@ sleeps , does not give up , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a Pre @-@ show @-@ Titan ,
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
&quot; so what makes you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly be f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you from , bl@@ amed the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you are doing it , you are doing what you are doing a teacher to be a ban@@ ker , a painter , Bill Gates , you just loves a different and that gives one of the bu@@ zz , when you knew the bu@@ zz , when the bu@@ zz stops , when the bu@@ zz stops , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart hear , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then I asked my &quot; southern state @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; I am on the way outside , late calling and she says , &quot; Mama , Do you play ? &quot;
and I will say NO to be aware of two things :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not . &quot;
they do not call anyone more &quot; bi@@ b . &quot;
when is this happened ?
&quot; I forgot it when I am Titan am and my tot@@ als , and here everything is changing my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , Do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing unusual .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and lack of struggle , I can do nothing but to aband@@ on . &quot;
I am foc@@ ussed .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country , which I created , the Marathon , the marathon , the army , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists is sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax , and the song in which it starts off , or whatever the girl enters &quot; &quot; The king@@ doms &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy club comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happened . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums will come back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
not the tot@@ als but a bu@@ zz .
&quot; and now I feel , when I know a magical secret . &quot;
but let us remain at the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums of work , the ti@@ dings , the tit@@ anium @-@ sum , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; when I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I &apos;m compl@@ aining about broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums may be . &quot;
the amount of money is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
true sums may depend on the love of love .
&quot; the amount of money is the current , which comes from the lust of life . &quot;
the real sums of money is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums ign@@ ores the pressure of the history , which has been completed tasks , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; true sums is the voice of God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps they whis@@ per@@ ed to God the wrong words because what God said to me that I am a Titan am ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I am doing this as a rule so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any guilt .
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; play not sp@@ elling , as they work . &quot;
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
&quot; I am always working , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to work at the workplace as at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person would rather work than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; time honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we bun@@ ni@@ es around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we are plat@@ ted cor@@ ps .
&quot; in doing so , I feel most sti@@ ff , absent , and confused . &quot;
I am always looking for my mobile phone .
yet it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz of the universe met me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play games , until I ask myself : why have we stopped working with the games ever ? &quot;
you can also say it ! do they always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a day of day . &quot;
you probably have it right but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ show .
your child can find less interesting when you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes , until they get into them , that they want something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bugs or cre@@ eks will be replaced .
&quot; and speak my te@@ ens @-@ daughter entire 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more need it not . &quot;
everyone can get 15 minutes at the piece even on a bad @-@ tune @-@ day !
15 minutes in the head !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are finished . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my benef@@ it@@ eness , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to have the bu@@ zz , to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
it is not about playing with their own children . it is about pleasure
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and save it .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I sch@@ ede and I victories . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to make myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes a bit , why not full 15 minutes away ? &quot;
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I listen to new ideas . the bu@@ zz struck me to new ideas . I use it to new ideas and love my job again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... not anymore . &quot;
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sums .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and therefore I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; I was sho@@ ok , that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and too more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire still burn .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the country , which I inv@@ ent , the marathon , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums , the other , the sums of life ; the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sums , the more this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more me ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am car . I think of things I awak@@ ened you to life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human trag@@ e@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to others , after a serious stroke or car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low capacity to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a steady state of severe disabilities . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I was surg@@ eries surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; you have certainly heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; low @-@ stag stimulation &quot; . thereby , one impl@@ anted an e @-@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improved . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kin@@ son who suffered severe tre@@ m@@ bling and serious pain .
Neuro@@ modu@@ lation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading the doctor and worked night and night in the emergency .
often I used patients with sk@@ ull @-@ shepherd &apos;s trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ t @-@ trau@@ mas trau@@ mas need to feel the brain and the sk@@ ull @-@ pressure is cont@@ ented .
&quot; to save the life , you have to dimin@@ ish the sk@@ ull pressure . &quot;
&quot; to do this , one sometimes has to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain . &quot;
&quot; instead of turning the brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to be able to grow cells from a ri@@ p@@ ent , comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the proper diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve it . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many cont@@ actors there are Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a regular cell culture . with large green cells , that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the bi@@ ologi@@ an lessons that stem cells un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of the body .
&quot; the adult has tri@@ bal cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising that this kind of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the op .
we did a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are im@@ mor@@ tal .
but these cells with@@ held differently .
they were slow and after a few weeks she died even .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell@@ aring @-@ population , which looked like stem cells , but was different . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our grand@@ hir@@ n@@ rin@@ se cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the F@@ itting of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
however one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our regular cells .
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , the brain healing . &quot;
this we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to see a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ speaking area , and then the cells just as cultivated as Jean @-@ François did &quot;
and then they are able to highlight them in the brain in order to be able to pursue them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we moved them to the de@@ bu@@ est@@ al of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ spl@@ antation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
&quot; one of our first questions was , what happens when we irrit@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue , and what will happen if we pl@@ ating the same cells in real brain tissue ? &quot;
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we traveled the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they disappeared after some weeks after they were taken back , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not disappear there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we add an injury to and rei@@ m@@ um@@ ph@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells have been preserved -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were rei@@ m@@ um@@ ph@@ ed .
&quot; evidence that they show , these small points are . these are the cells that we rec@@ kl@@ ed in vit@@ ro in the culture . &quot;
&quot; here , we were not able to stop . &quot;
&quot; do these cells also help a monkey , to recover from a brain injury ? &quot;
&quot; so , we trained monkeys with a manual approach . &quot;
they had to take feed @-@ pell@@ ets from a tray .
they made them very well .
when they reached a stable skill level we last we in mot@@ oric Cor@@ tex the hand@@ mot@@ oric sector .
&quot; subsequently , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen at people , it reco@@ vering spont@@ aneously to some degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plasti@@ fic@@ i@@ able bra@@ ins . they recover in a certain degree as well as in the monkey .
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had achieved his degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ ant his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkeys , who recovered spont@@ aneously . &quot;
it can take about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before the injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we see the cells of rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ess : the same monkey , two months after the irrit@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; I can tell you , that was also very exciting results for us . &quot;
since that time we found a lot more about these cells .
we can make them free@@ zing and later use .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Par@@ kin@@ son . &quot;
but our dream is still to impl@@ ant them in humans .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to heal itself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies at the people . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one has to fill out about two kilo@@ grams and forms of forms to run this kind of studies . &quot;
BG : it is understandable that the brain is very delicate etc .
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to look forward to the start of clinical studies . if you continue to look forward to the future , how many years it takes to come to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
initially it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select the patient , perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after this , one has to apply this to a multi @-@ centralized study . &quot;
first you have to really feel that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is sure of course . J@@ B : natural .
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us of it . &quot;
BG : thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the br@@ ittle plant , which it is in reality , but as invent@@ ories of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ altered gl@@ ab@@ ine .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ ah@@ mer in Beijing have proven doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely non @-@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy f@@ ade with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not to have an impact on austerity , which were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; in this moment I thought that there might be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my un@@ think@@ able friends who would be repeated to me that democracy would change if she would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe with me again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group believe us , we could save ourselves the democracy , but that we need a real and defen@@ ders of democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies will be wast@@ ed , our future dark and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently threatened by our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin @-@ par@@ adox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , which thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg , &quot;
but few recognize its twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be sc@@ ary to invest , where it would be productive to invest in , where there would be productive and income , with whom you need to carry the Schul@@ den@@ berg , and also to produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars have been invested in the United States and in the eurozone , in all the wealth produced goods , such as industrial installations , machinery , offices , squares , lines , and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars sounds a lot of money , until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ llion US dollars , which at the same time passes through the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing but , except for the stock market prices and the property prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital is the twin summit , which is not equal in the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and therefore a low overall economic demand that would be out of fear , the Proph@@ ecy of the Or@@ acles might be true that his son would kill him if he grows , &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the circumstances will bring about that O@@ edi@@ pus kill him . &quot;
this is my ha@@ sten@@ ance with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely wast@@ ed Art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially to finance these technologies , &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue , what do we understand by democracy ? &quot;
&quot; Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form , in which the open and the poor to control the government as a majority . &quot;
of course the ath@@ arian democracy closed too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , there would be an error to make the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these closures . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor of the Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that she gave them the working class , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but rather more important and decisive , which gives them the right to political co@@ determination with the same vocal wei@@ ghting in questions of the state . &quot;
the ath@@ arian democracy has not lasted long --
&quot; like a candle , which glo@@ ws very bright , it is also rapidly spread . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal democratic democr@@ acies don &apos;t have their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ ic democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the poor poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruling class . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came only when a complete division of politics and the economy was possible and the democratic process has been incorporated into politics , while the economy is the world of corporations - a more democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in our today &apos;s democr@@ acies has been held since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , an im@@ plac@@ able struggle between the two instead of moving towards politics and making them do@@ cking them . &quot;
wonder why politicians are no longer like this before ?
it is not located on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it is possible to be present in the government today , and still not in power , because the power of politics is st@@ acked in the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ sten@@ ings with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is like a herd of smoking that has so sustainable the animals that they are nour@@ ished and dec@@ im@@ ated that it is at the end of that hunger . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that the policy itself grows so far from the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of corporations is increasing , inequality increases , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; s@@ ells from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the well @-@ being of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policies and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , the women and the foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea about 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t work very much .
&quot; the teaching of the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be , that the working class reg@@ ained only by a miracle a position like in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and wast@@ age . &quot;
but there is one solution : to create the working class !
capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ hn@@ ised by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , such as long economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ating the twin summit will be higher , and the social conflicts deeper , as it will be very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and considering that we will join the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end the film &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements , which he has brought forth , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is similar through a d@@ yst@@ er , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; or through something that the company will serve in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or to put people into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; &quot; Ag@@ ora &quot; , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we can be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what does it look like it might look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ er ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples very soon . &quot;
&quot; in the business sector , please make a capital market in which you earn money , while you are working and in which your funds will follow you from a job to next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working at the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and dis@@ solve and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies but are not working in them , and employees who work there , but no exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and hair , and ultimately no em@@ por@@ ous tw@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please briefly before that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ative exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest economies &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tr@@ aded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays off the sum , which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade agreement of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are r@@ ar . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 had suggested .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have it , particularly in front of the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe you is simultaneously liber@@ ated , in which they privileged people pre@@ fers , and Marxist because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the M@@ ül@@ men of history , and key@@ n@@ esian , global key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ er ?
the answer depends on how we will decide in politics together .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is known as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it is not only our democr@@ acies dest@@ abil@@ ise but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; like Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely vi@@ vi@@ dly . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if one is not wir@@ r , one does not think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : it is a very Greek , a kind of philosop@@ hic explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers , you have said very clearly what you keep from the view of the West on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the sem@@ bl@@ ance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of them play , -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resem@@ bles today the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- do you remember -- we tend to connect with democracy , which is an error , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ al , as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was very skep@@ tical as concerned with democratic development .
&quot; what you can observe now in China , resem@@ bles very much the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experience as a finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I ins@@ ect that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; let us far@@ ewell to the self @-@ suff@@ iciency , and the lasting denial is that a massive Cor@@ ruption of the eurozone is running , and continues to pursue the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was that these denial are revealed -- &quot;
&quot; to make it right . unfortunately , the powers have been elected within the Eurozone , within the Euro Group , continues to be the denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism it will be able to delay even a while , but when the change happens , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure .
BG : do you have any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who look back -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any Minister , who , after 6 months in office , particularly in such a tense situation , he did not make a mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for renewal of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; I believed there was an honest interest on the side of the don@@ ors , to find a common solution . &quot;
but that was not there .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , only because they did not want to deal with the uph@@ e@@ av@@ als that ran through the Eurozone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to conf@@ ess that they have been cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; great depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the credit@@ ors &apos; Troika , which has imposed us this policy , conf@@ essed : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ s@@ onal error . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all the , and despite the aggressive day of talks , you seem to be quite a pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming to someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survi@@ ves .
&quot; for if they have not survived , the fre@@ ed fli@@ s shall be demon@@ ic and the European Union will destroy . &quot;
&quot; this will not be dis@@ astro@@ us for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to hit the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , which it appears to me , it will likewise be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as of non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you very much for you at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; Roy Price have never heard the majority , even though it is probably responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for so many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is directed at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a icons and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tactics . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for it to broadcast the shows and the content that Amazon will produce . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought sector . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot be selected .
&quot; he has to shows shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are right on the right side of the corner . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2,500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows can get this review . &quot;
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , it is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the addi@@ ctive , where , after having asked a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; where there are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ars &quot; -- -- that should tell you what happens at this end of the turn . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price wasn &apos;t worried , to get to the left side of the corner because I think you already needs special intelligence to under@@ line &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes up more thoughts on the average expression , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good or bad , they simply do not inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon makes it something , that &apos;s why Roy is nothing to risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he requires a guaranteed success , so he holds a contest . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online , where everyone can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon is for free things , one can still be able to correct ? &quot;
millions of viewers will look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they will be observed when viewing these shows . &quot;
you will be observed by Roy and his team which will record everything .
&quot; you grasp , when to start the show when one gets p@@ ses , which parts you can ski@@ ps or look again . &quot;
you collect millions of data to decide on these data which show they should be produced .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and from it results the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com through four Republi@@ can U.S. power stations . &quot;
you made this show .
do someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because they were not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House is located at 7,5 -- so something about the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time when another manager is placed on a top show through Data Analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it a bit different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked up with the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ators , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use these data to find these little details about the audience , what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a mu@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; house of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this turn . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
one has two very funny , data se@@ ated firms . &quot;
&quot; they combine this many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because logic says somehow that all of it should work .
&quot; if one coll@@ ects millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you have been optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the minus what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis is not working so it is something frigh@@ tening because we are living in a time , in which we grasp more and more statistics in order to make serious decisions , far beyond TV . &quot;
does someone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in the United States and ask for dismis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding to decide whether a show will be good or bad , a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; twenty @-@ day television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are created . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data is sealed is false .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; 2009 , Google announced that they can say thanks to data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the lim@@ b type , pre@@ lim@@ b -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully well and was a great news . the success ran in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked properly , year by year until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data is sealed as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life a -- at work , in the law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medicine . over the years I have detected some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions .
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem , do you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , you cut this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you score the parts again to grasp a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you need to do so several times , but there are always two things : apart and again put together . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help out a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re@@ mit parts once and then come to a resolution .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we possess it all : our brain . &quot;
&quot; when there is something where the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to merge again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially when the brain is an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have data and understanding , where they must go in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use the data to better understand their audience , why they otherwise wouldn &apos;t have been able to re@@ use all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not standing in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon was doing this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they had to match TV ideas , then when they selected &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order to not forget , this device is fairly useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
before there was data it was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ e- or no matter you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will return it later with a technology demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions made in my life until I should listen to the ball in retro@@ spect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by some much exposure , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the fundamental building .
&quot; thus , perhaps the ball cl@@ ü@@ ger and cl@@ ü@@ ger and cl@@ ü@@ ger . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I think this as very encouraging message that , despite the large amount of data still pays out , make decisions , an expert in what you are doing , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the turn . &quot;
thank you beautiful .
