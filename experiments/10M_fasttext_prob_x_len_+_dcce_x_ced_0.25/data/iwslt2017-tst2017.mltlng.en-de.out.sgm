<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as the New York Times-Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for a long time before the someone had heard of Edward Snowden, the isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular, that the NSA has illegal telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service in which the CIA was literally superimposed on Iran for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the nuts sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapters not coincided?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has been established against revenge and called on it to call its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this move, he became a symbol for the pattern of government, whistleblowers and to punish journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish the secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right, if media does not get this information and if it cannot protect the identity of the dispatch, which they give price."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government went up at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused, and said he would prefer to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were for years of reference, that it would be crucial in their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring the Reporter and springs can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than to fail and concise longed to the statements, that could also carry out his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without prior consent, his phone numbers be secretly concerned,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit points, and even zippers with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to judge Jeffrey Sterling, an CIA Whistleblowers and Risens."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama spoke with his lawyer, whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments from him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of that a whistleblowers went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"thus, we put the press work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional order, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the technology of the government allows to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they may take that from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that had not been written as Risen Book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mail or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source distribution system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the internet famous, which was developed by us Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation at which I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of mail an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"here you can upload documents or mail, just as with any ordinary mail form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are encrypted and stored on a server, with which the respective news agency access has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no more information secretly, and many of the information they would require, would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spy technologies that all endanger us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to us to ensure that not only technology, such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to evidently express misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the dispensation of abnormalities at the care of soldiers knows and want to report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to be pushed for flint water from Flint. or a Wallstreet insiders that warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only for those who want to raise crimes, but to protect our full constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the greatest datlery of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that friche and powers are hidden in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we bate Robert Palmer of Global Witness to an explanation.] this week we were owned by news about a check of 11 million documents related in Panama's local law firm Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there is reports that a composite of the brutal dictator Baschar al-Assad stamp-firms in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia, President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be out there a lot of rich people and others who are nervous on the next release, and to the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the plot of an agency grilled or a John-Grisham.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying from you, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address what?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: when the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians, how secret tax havens are utilized by some few to hide and to wear -- something that we have been discussing and revealing it for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many men appears very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoffs.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were so far no prominent Americans who arrived in these revelations, this scandal. "</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle according to which these tax havens work, Mosbag has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we would have a backup of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to set up less information to found a company than to get a librarian."</seg>
<seg id="68">"this kind of inconsistency in the US has allowed its employees to zoomed in schoolchildren, schoolchildren."</seg>
<seg id="69">It has helped scammers to rip especially andisparate investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a covered wrapping into the offices of 13 Anwaltsfirms in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators found himself as an African Minister, bringing the suspicious money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked, that all right up to a lawyer's counsel proposals made, how he could transate his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all preclusters. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and naturally there has been given money to us. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this as an individual.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, which has underlined our uncovered proposals."</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top polishing which is involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we have to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules in order to aggravate this kind of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">"that may sound everything very trusive, as if we could do anything about it, as if nothing else had changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful ones."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as born optimism I see that quite a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have witnessed more transparency regarding what the owners of companies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU is recorded in central stops at the national level who truly is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a draft law in both parliament chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, as a means of use in the U.S. and globally for greater transparency."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people, which are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the headset."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, which stand up and say," "transparency is not good for business." ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and work for it to end this kind of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can end the transparency, which now allows you to end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally end."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I was almost kidnapped, and in the trunk of a red Mazdas were."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a backstop."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained to stand and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and just made a road trip all the country. after that he would go to the peace corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where sling you today night?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing even worse," "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What I am now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a bedroom now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just came to know him! he says it would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazel."</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard myself:" "I have a air conditioning. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"one voice in my head said," "uh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I was wandering to the blanket and thought:" Oh man! what have I built into it? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A game-foreign sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if it is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I was given such a fear that I went out of the bed, on the tenly to the door, and my sleeping-room door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he had bought from me, depends today in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my perspective completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe people who were sold to me as strangers, actually friends, who only waited for it?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"when people are on my air mattress, he was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the airmat."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a time lead, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate pull off and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe creativity can make it, anxiety in fun to transform."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new fellow inhabitants Brian Chesky:" Brian, I promised how to earn something with us. our apartment will stay at a designer-bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and breakfast each morning. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at a wooden loft with us for 20 dollars on air conditioning.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure to decorate our cheeses cheque Omelet completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">We travelled with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door into the castle fell to rigid Brian and I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former fellow inhabitants, Nate Brarcado, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to see if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our Investors:" we want to create a website, on the people publicly pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baker -- the kind of room whose doors are completed when you visit. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"through the Internet, they can invite them to join wild people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they are not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still very consolation, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if one has a problem, you can get on the things that you can do. we were able to designen."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create more trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make a difference?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a cost and what degree we would like to raise.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I like to unlock that you unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unmistakable mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quietly trip from panic, which you are feeling now -- -- is just what hosts will feel when they open the door for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only one, which is more personal than your mobile phone, your home is home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">What does it feel about keeping the unbridged mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so who has now Al Gores's cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you declare on Twitter that he condense to the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour wouldn't have been presented with his name only once he does, where he comes from, how his dog or children are hot?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 bassessments that all say: "he really can count very well-handed mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you'd have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-driven feedback system reinforces confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things done wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to prevent negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both the host and guest had given their judgements until we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined, as probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprise, we trust the people most, who are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting is it when you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three Beessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, but it changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation emishes similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep-times atriots.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we also experienced that trust is dependent on how much you are doing."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if one speaks too little as for example," Hi! "" you do not get an answer. "</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells you, how for example:" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the inquiry is also rather not accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "great works of art in your apartment! I have my family vacation." ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on what subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "our entire company builds upon hope that the right design can help you overcome our prejudices against strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we had not reckoned, the great multitude of people, who were more than willing to present these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people are eligible for our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a need for which previously was not covered."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything is smoothly running."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been allowed to have been celebrated or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I collaborated with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing sclimmerit than those calls. it already hurts when I am only thinking of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment, which you hear in the voice of the tension, was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, of the 123 million euros, the nights had only a fraction of each problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted each other to justice.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if confidence works, it can arise wonder."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host was driving him to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation.</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers, who tend to tend to stem cell activities."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protective angels who save one life, even though they don't know one."</seg>
<seg id="218">"driving one in your own car to hospital when you die dies, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want you to feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay runs.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money-action are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I met for the first time about this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economical trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it is just to call" "Rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">"share Economy describes a trade, human relations promised."</seg>
<seg id="229">"people lay a part of themselves, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when one travel today, it is easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but therefore less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place we visited, a group there would be more announcing that there would be a thorough and to show one of a pub that has never heard before."</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to create apartments from reason to share?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have the thought of mutual profit?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relations, instead of solitude and deduction."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South koreas capital Seoul, this project has already been started. many parking places that were belonging to the government."</seg>
<seg id="240">"now houses were offered. students, who were in search of a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were introduced to people whose children were killed. there were incubators programmes,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, through our platform only €785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreigner or even the host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not so crazy as it was put together.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also previously available.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has it just worked?</seg>
<seg id="248">"aside from luck and Timing, we see that you can find the right design with the components of the trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deepest prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find the astounding as well</seg>
<seg id="251">Quite overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think everytime when a red Mazda goes over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A glide? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brainwashing underwear, a terrorist attack?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I won't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee owner -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">An Möller-Fitness-Fanatikerin, "</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, for, Baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to ousinme."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to carry Hijab, my head coverage."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were unveiled: "why oppressed you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lustige was: at that time there was a feminist declaration of independence, and on the pressure which I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unbeatable beauty ideal."</seg>

<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the" Egyptian American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I was sitting in my kitchen, had at the end of my breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" Eilabort "." "</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people dispersed out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock was rapidly changing in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched on the TV channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists "...,"... "in the name of Islam,"... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu turned me the acts of others from a civil war into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the US to move into a new city and start with the building.</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we were silent -- as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved at this night into our apartment, in a new town, where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, looked and read the warnings of national Islamic organizations that said," be vigilant, "" Seid careful, "" lead in well illuminated areas, "" Destrusts do not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week in it.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday at that week -- the day in which Muslims gather to bed.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of it.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims and of people who was holding for Muslims, into free and discarded."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who have attacked this country to have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have defeated the anger of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions. "</seg>
<seg id="319">"there are the accusations, which are hard."</seg>
<seg id="320">"today we can actually say people," There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When are we going on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to join Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as from a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It just raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor you can be removed as a whole and a benign tumor one only keeps on observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are useless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, earchers and Olympioniken."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it may keep a few parking spaces, but not the terror stop."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith, tolerant, and to show greater citizens."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC, recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radical process, one has noticed that he will start online. as a first person, the person goes from their church, even by their family, so that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims and everyone who abhors their behavior and its ideology is a traitor, or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">"some are still claiming, Islam is a non-violent religion."</seg>
<seg id="338">"lastly, a group such as the IS is based its brutality with the Quran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add ourselves into the imagination, if one acknowledges them as a representative of 1,6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam such as the Ku club-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons in their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one puts a look at it, it is not driving them what they are in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things in the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an astonishing history:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would have imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. each clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of the injustice in the world, it would only bring in difficulty."</seg>
<seg id="350">"of nothing inspired and something that would have been given to her guard, she was a main objective for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised you a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam made the link to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of protecting her anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, he kept it to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day based on our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show us: if we fear us, at least three things happen. "</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept an authoritarian governance system, conformance and prejudices. "</seg>
<seg id="360">"one study shows: if one has been telling messages about Muslims, in which negative about Muslims have been reported, it was more than military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when looking at when the mood against Muslims hoss down -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two electrages.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public, in order to inflate the foundations of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning character.</seg>
<seg id="367">"perhaps we felt it as the first, but the toxic air of fear seemed to us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"when entering a collective bargaining, it is not just about to explain itself."</seg>

<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, which was in the afternoon when he was in her apartment, as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his facebook page."</seg>

<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or were we kept safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we bestoes it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we left to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to choose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat we were silent, with high-pressure on the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, my shoes went out, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, sent me to."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was fully filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanks and was called our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, believers, and non-believers who have come to intervene, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">I have collapsed this moment.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="407">"what began as a platform for Bastler, stands shortly before, a billion business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air-dispatch position in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by relying, flight devices reach high speed and speeding up in the very narrow room."</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-efficient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and to respond generally to nature laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to present you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system autopom, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamical tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a offsprings of our labs."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Any flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine the calculations on board which the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest Ebene, for example." "Start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter, "</seg>
<seg id="422">"a leaflet, which tries to hit two flies with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in the downward trip efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters it can fluctuate, and has thereby great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of hedge starters is that they are sensitive on turbulence such as wind blows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">"the idea behind it is that the air is no matter in what location, the optimum position regained and the performance can be improved by practicing."</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often introduce ourselves fundamental abstracts relating to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for finding the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopter are known as machines with a thousand movable parts, which coincide, to harm you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots could fly away-controlled flight devices, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a rear wall."</seg>
<seg id="435">Unfortunately we discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner as a mechanically simplest remote device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no clutshell, hinges and Quercider, no further actuators or controllowing area, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simpy, the interior lives very much, so that it can be stable and move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear. to bring it to the rock, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it exactly when all watch, is low, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the Moon is a practice in genital solitude, this machine is here, the omiscopter with its eight propellors, a exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that it is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"through this, he will receive the extraordinary skill,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is filmed or even how it rotating."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight propellors."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly at the catch."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that at.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines are to be part of our day-day, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made of two separate two-propellers machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">These is in the clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they are like a high-performance squares.</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, a bit wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, electronics or a cordless -- can continue to fly the machine if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">"we will demonstrate that, by doing one half airworthy."</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration is examined synthetic raids.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic print. "</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and provide them with localizing technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully will motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as dron wants to be on Broadway a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as us lies the wage of development and creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures allowed to shape them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">"the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, is the icing on the cake."</seg>

<seg id="480">"but enough people realized it as a mad genies, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation was funded to its idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work they built the Detector LIGO: the laser interferometer- gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following time, the precision of LIGO could considerably increase significantly, which improved the performance performance considerably."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, it is called Advanced LIGO."</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a final test run to clear some smaller, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational crankshafts made by the two collious black holes through the earth."</seg>

<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my todsick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically this was the fruits of my life-work.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked, is no longer science-fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicists at MIT. he has investigated since 23 years of gravitational waves from black holes and their observatory signals, which however are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cutter in the plumage of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when temporary, the wave will pull the room and his entire content is stretched in one direction and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, lecturers in courses of relevance theory often lead a properly alberish dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusty, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves is extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each one of us stretched out the waves of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is, 20 nulls after the comma, followed by a 1st bium, we explained the LIGO-employee for crazy."</seg>

<seg id="503">"but physicists are finalized, and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne has published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO is more than one ear than one eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial als, the size of your cell. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"that is quite handy. for example, you can make a picture or a map of things by using the score of several points coming around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones is that different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that means you especially much."</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen according to specific properties such as sound and pitch, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind it."</seg>

<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"duel Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by watching changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">"at least, for LIGO the common frequencies are in the audible range."</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave-patterns in weakness, we can speak all the literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravity can listen to laughing, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, with what my colleague Scott has already been busy for a very long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not swivel holes, circlamp simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very quickly, you hear the same circle with an additional sound change. that sounds like us: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-W</seg>

<seg id="527">AA: consider us short what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the longest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns that revolve around one hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces before.</seg>

<seg id="534">"on this way, we can listen to the space and invisible."</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- virtually or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a Supernova, for example. I would like to know why masthech stars in Supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about this.</seg>

<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be more transparent glass. the urbang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the alls, but we will never see it because the urbang is shining through its own glow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"with the gravitational-waves it should be possible, up to the start back."</seg>
<seg id="542">"the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we are never seen before and of which we have no idea. things that we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO took right in the first approach of things which we were not expected."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes as LIGO them observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the sauce for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we brought forth out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circle of cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in all.</seg>

<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"one year long I would say anything" yes! "" I was afraid of this. "</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter whether it made me nervous, me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">I wanted to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">I wanted to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared, I fear my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, speeches to hold, my social anxiety -- Puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes, that my life changed deeply, on an unexpected item. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all" kittens, "</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she would be a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked her once I could play with her, when I was just on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new attitude to my family. from there I vibrate to play with them again, as soon as you call me up. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I will always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am glad."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an intriguing side effect: only recently, I actually understood that the" Yes "-were saved to play with my children my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am autorecin. I think of things that awakened you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produced television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style. "</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for applying 70 hours program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"each programme offers hundreds of jobs, which previously did not exist."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for one episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 millions of television, four hours TV, three broadcasts, which are simultaneously in production, four episodes, 15 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: the Catch, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series will run on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Over the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 these 70 TV hours are broadcasts, which I myself created, and not just produced, so still obtrendlessly. I have to find time, really stille, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and to tell my stories about it."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfire, which are around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that still does?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I do not want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think, when the word" author. "</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you, so that all of you who work so hard, if you're talking about a company, a country or a household, so you understand that I am not just sitting on the computer and fantasizing, and it's true when I say, I understand that it's not going to dream with a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all the blood, everything blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"if I am deepened in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I put troops on, as malt I on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"thus, we put a high tone, delivered a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and unsettling, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sums begins in my head, and it grows and growing, and the buzz sounds like a bustling street, I could always go on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I'm giving them the sums up that I am writing to writing that writing gives me pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the totals -- when I began working with television production, when I began working and working and working together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The amount is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The amount is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums of God is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums of sums you have, then you cannot be different from the size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feel, not unlike the size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what you call the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not doing for failure and I just know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things at the same time, the more they see, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more you have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, which I created, the Marathon, the marathon, the army, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only that sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stops the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, exaggerated, exaggerated, expanded."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters to the truth are accustomed to that their mother is a single workbook."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "Look, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums were disbanded."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was clashed.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work no more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans working, 15 hours-day, did not practise, no Reuben, nothing delegating, a Titan schlsleeps, does not give up, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a Pre-show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what makes you do, if what you do, the work you love, suddenly be faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "Heul you from, blamed the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you are doing it, you are doing what you are doing a teacher to be a banker, a painter, Bill Gates, you just loves a different and that gives one of the buzz, when you knew the buzz, when the buzz stops, when the buzz stops, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart hear, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I asked my "southern state-waitress."</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way outside, late calling and she says," Mama, Do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say NO to be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">They do not call anyone more "bib."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I forgot it when I am Titan am and my totals, and here everything is changing my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mama, Do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops "." "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing unusual.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and lack of struggle, I can do nothing but to abandon."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I created, the Marathon, the marathon, the army, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists is sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax, and the song in which it starts off, or whatever the girl enters" "The kingdoms". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy club comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happened."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums will come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the totals but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">"and now I feel, when I know a magical secret."</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain at the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums of work, the tidings, the titanium-sum, that is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"when I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I'm complaining about broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums may be."</seg>
<seg id="707">The amount of money is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">True sums may depend on the love of love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the amount of money is the current, which comes from the lust of life."</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums of money is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the pressure of the history, which has been completed tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true sums is the voice of God's voice in my ear, but perhaps they whispered to God the wrong words because what God said to me that I am a Titan am?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this as a rule so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"play not spelling, as they work."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I am always working, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what a person would rather work than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"time honestly, I call myself" Titan ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we bunnies around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We are platted corps.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I feel most stiff, absent, and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I am always looking for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">Yet it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe met me."</seg>
<seg id="739">"I play and play games, until I ask myself: why have we stopped working with the games ever?"</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! do they always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me for naive, for a day of day."</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have it right but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet-show.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child can find less interesting when you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes, until they get into them, that they want something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybugs or creeks will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teens-daughter entire 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more need it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get 15 minutes at the piece even on a bad-tune-day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes in the head!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are finished."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my benefiteness, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to have the buzz, to have a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with their own children. it is about pleasure</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and save it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I schede and I victories. friends meet, books read, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" stands just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training, when I wanted to make myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes a bit, why not full 15 minutes away?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens up, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I listen to new ideas. the buzz struck me to new ideas. I use it to new ideas and love my job again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the buzz is not me... not anymore. "</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends. "</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and therefore I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"I was shook, that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and too more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the country, which I invent, the marathon, the canvases, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums, the other, the sums of life; the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, beating, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more me!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am car. I think of things I awakened you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to others, after a serious stroke or car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low capacity to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a steady state of severe disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was surgeries surgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"you have certainly heard of one of the most prominent, the" low-stag stimulation ". thereby, one implanted an e-de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered severe trembling and serious pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading the doctor and worked night and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I used patients with skull-shepherd's trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at skull-Hirt-traumas traumas need to feel the brain and the skull-pressure is contented.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save the life, you have to diminish the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"to do this, one sometimes has to remove a part of swollen brain."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of turning the brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to be able to grow cells from a ripent, comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the proper diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive it."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many contactors there are Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a regular cell culture. with large green cells, that are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biologian lessons that stem cells unripe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of the body.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult has tribal cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising that this kind of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the op.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells withheld differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slow and after a few weeks she died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cellaring-population, which looked like stem cells, but was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our grandhirnrinse cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they ensure the Fitting of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">However one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our regular cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, the brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to see a piece of brain mass from the non-speaking area, and then the cells just as cultivated as Jean-François did"</seg>
<seg id="853">And then they are able to highlight them in the brain in order to be able to pursue them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we moved them to the debuestal of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">"one of our first questions was, what happens when we irritate these cells in normal brain tissue, and what will happen if we plating the same cells in real brain tissue?"</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we traveled the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they disappeared after some weeks after they were taken back, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not disappear there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we add an injury to and reimumphed exactly the same cells and now the cells have been preserved -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimumphed.</seg>
<seg id="862">"evidence that they show, these small points are. these are the cells that we reckled in vitro in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"here, we were not able to stop."</seg>
<seg id="864">"do these cells also help a monkey, to recover from a brain injury?"</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we trained monkeys with a manual approach."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed-pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level we last we in motoric Cortex the handmotoric sector.</seg>
<seg id="869">"subsequently, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen at people, it recovering spontaneously to some degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastificiable brains. they recover in a certain degree as well as in the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had achieved his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implant his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side they see the monkeys, who recovered spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can take about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we see the cells of reimpless: the same monkey, two months after the irritation."</seg>
<seg id="877">"I can tell you, that was also very exciting results for us."</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can make them freezing and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies at the people."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, one has to fill out about two kilograms and forms of forms to run this kind of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable that the brain is very delicate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a fast professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to look forward to the start of clinical studies. if you continue to look forward to the future, how many years it takes to come to hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select the patient, perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after this, one has to apply this to a multi-centralized study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you have to really feel that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is sure of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us of it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the brittle plant, which it is in reality, but as inventories of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unaltered glabine.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imahmer in Beijing have proven doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely non-democratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy fade with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not to have an impact on austerity, which were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"in this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my unthinkable friends who would be repeated to me that democracy would change if she would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe with me again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup believe us, we could save ourselves the democracy, but that we need a real and defenders of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies will be wasted, our future dark and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently threatened by our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin-paradox". ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the Schuldenberg,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is to be scary to invest, where it would be productive to invest in, where there would be productive and income, with whom you need to carry the Schuldenberg, and also to produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, 3.4 Billions US dollars have been invested in the United States and in the eurozone, in all the wealth produced goods, such as industrial installations, machinery, offices, squares, lines, and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 Billions US dollars sounds a lot of money, until you compare it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time passes through the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing but, except for the stock market prices and the property prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital is the twin summit, which is not equal in the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-old in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and therefore a low overall economic demand that would be out of fear, the Prophecy of the Oracles might be true that his son would kill him if he grows,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unfortunately, the circumstances will bring about that Oedipus kill him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hastenance with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely wasted Art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially to finance these technologies," "green" "technologies that are decisive for saving the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, what do we understand by democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">"Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form, in which the open and the poor to control the government as a majority."</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course the atharian democracy closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, there would be an error to make the significance of the athenic democracy due to these closures."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor of the Athenic democracy was and is that she gave them the working class, and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but rather more important and decisive, which gives them the right to political codetermination with the same vocal weighting in questions of the state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The atharian democracy has not lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which glows very bright, it is also rapidly spread."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democratic democracies don't have their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athic democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the poor poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy came only when a complete division of politics and the economy was possible and the democratic process has been incorporated into politics, while the economy is the world of corporations - a more democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "in our today's democracies has been held since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, an implacable struggle between the two instead of moving towards politics and making them docking them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer like this before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not located on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it is possible to be present in the government today, and still not in power, because the power of politics is stacked in the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hastenings with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is like a herd of smoking that has so sustainable the animals that they are nourished and decimated that it is at the end of that hunger."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that the policy itself grows so far from the self-caused economic crisis. the power of corporations is increasing, inequality increases, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism the" Demos "[the people] sells from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the well-being of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policies and the economy again, and it would be better if the" demos "keeps control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, the women and the foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea about 100 years ago and it didn't work very much.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be, that the working class regained only by a miracle a position like in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and wastage."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to create the working class!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Niedriglohnised by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, such as long economy and politics are separate areas, automating the twin summit will be higher, and the social conflicts deeper, as it will be very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to reshape the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and considering that we will join the reunified field, otherwise we end the film" "matrix" "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements, which he has brought forth, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is similar through a dyster, similar to the" matrix "," or through something that the company will serve in "Star Trek," or to put people into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "" Agora "," in long talks the meaning of life. "</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what does it look like it might look like this" star Trek "-like utopia rather than the" matrix "similar dyster?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples very soon."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the business sector, please make a capital market in which you earn money, while you are working and in which your funds will follow you from a job to next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working at the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and dissolve and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies but are not working in them, and employees who work there, but no exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and hair, and ultimately no emporous twins."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please briefly before that our national currencies would have a free fluctuative exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest economies], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the Cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and every government pays off the sum, which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade agreement of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is invested in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 had suggested.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have it, particularly in front of the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe you is simultaneously liberated, in which they privileged people prefers, and Marxist because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the Mülmen of history, and keynesian, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dyster?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we will decide in politics together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand, what Larry Summers is known as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it is not only our democracies destabilise but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, this is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like keynes, and therefore I am also completely vividly."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if one is not wirr, one does not think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: it is a very Greek, a kind of philosophic explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers, you have said very clearly what you keep from the view of the West on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of them play, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I may say that provocative, China resembles today the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- do you remember -- we tend to connect with democracy, which is an error, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberal, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was very skeptical as concerned with democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what you can observe now in China, resembles very much the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as a finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I insect that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back for six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"let us farewell to the self-sufficiency, and the lasting denial is that a massive Corruption of the eurozone is running, and continues to pursue the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal was that these denial are revealed --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"to make it right. unfortunately, the powers have been elected within the Eurozone, within the Euro Group, continues to be the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism it will be able to delay even a while, but when the change happens, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who look back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any Minister, who, after 6 months in office, particularly in such a tense situation, he did not make a mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for renewal of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"I believed there was an honest interest on the side of the donors, to find a common solution."</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not there.</seg>

<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"Roy Price have never heard the majority, even though it is probably responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for so many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is directed at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a icons and describes on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tactics. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for it to broadcast the shows and the content that Amazon will produce."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought sector."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to shows shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are right on the right side of the corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2,500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows can get this review."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, it is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows, the addictive, where, after having asked a season, your brain asks:" "where there are more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiars "-- -- that should tell you what happens at this end of the turn."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price wasn't worried, to get to the left side of the corner because I think you already needs special intelligence to underline" "Toddlers and Tiaras". ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes up more thoughts on the average expression, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good or bad, they simply do not inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon makes it something, that's why Roy is nothing to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he requires a guaranteed success, so he holds a contest."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online, where everyone can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon is for free things, one can still be able to correct?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers will look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they will be observed when viewing these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be observed by Roy and his team which will record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you grasp, when to start the show when one gets pses, which parts you can skips or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide on these data which show they should be produced.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and from it results the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom through four Republican U.S. power stations. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Do someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because they were not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House is located at 7,5 -- so something about the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time when another manager is placed on a top show through Data Analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it a bit different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked up with the existing data on the Netflix spectators, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use these data to find these little details about the audience, what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a muator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," house of Cards ". Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" "gets a 9,1 review on this turn. so exactly where they wanted to go."</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very funny, data seated firms. "</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they combine this many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that all of it should work.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if one collects millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You have been optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the minus what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis is not working so it is something frightening because we are living in a time, in which we grasp more and more statistics in order to make serious decisions, far beyond TV."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in the United States and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding to decide whether a show will be good or bad, a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"twenty-day television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are created. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data is sealed is false.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"2009, Google announced that they can say thanks to data analysis outbreaks of flu, the limb type, prelimb -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great news. the success ran in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked properly, year by year until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data is sealed as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life a -- at work, in the law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medicine. over the years I have detected some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you have to solve a complex problem, do you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, you cut this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you score the parts again to grasp a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you need to do so several times, but there are always two things: apart and again put together."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help out a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to remit parts once and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we possess it all: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something where the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to merge again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially when the brain is an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think, Netflix was so successful because they have data and understanding, where they must go in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use the data to better understand their audience, why they otherwise wouldn't have been able to reuse all these parts, and make it a show like" House of Cards "that was not standing in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show that meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon was doing this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they had to match TV ideas, then when they selected" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order to not forget, this device is fairly useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data it was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball". it's amazing. for decisions using a Jae- or no matter you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will return it later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions made in my life until I should listen to the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by some much exposure, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the fundamental building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"thus, perhaps the ball clüger and clüger and clüger. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I think this as very encouraging message that, despite the large amount of data still pays out, make decisions, an expert in what you are doing, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the turn."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
