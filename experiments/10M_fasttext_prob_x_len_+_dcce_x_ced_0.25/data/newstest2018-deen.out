Munich 1856 : four cards which change your view of the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people will encounter young people . &quot;
&quot; a tomb , where now is du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
petty @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers manage the un@@ ru@@ sty cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ n promotes exciting stories to days .
it is annoying when maps are not currently present .
&quot; the one knows everyone who had already had to rain in , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a h@@ mon@@ ing road showed a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historic maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as in Bavaria of the government , are anything but up to date - but that is why it is very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially when you compar@@ es them with current online maps .
&quot; then it will be clear , as cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a spl@@ attered canvas that one sees as such is not equal .
&quot; in the great sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs were made for cities and congreg@@ ations , so called Ur@@ posi@@ tional blades , incorporated . &quot;
these origin@@ ates according to the Bay@@ er@@ aman Committee administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and jump in the first ver@@ messung of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army @-@ leader occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second World War with Austria .
Napoleon presents an overview of the occupied country and gave an top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria into order - of course to military purposes .
&quot; although French troops passed away with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was the contemporary neighbours that created the idea of a surface area of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Insurance administration . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional blatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others to find on the web site of the Bav@@ arian National Library .
the comparison between early morning / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that emerg@@ es in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated .
&quot; Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , as a Mün@@ ch@@ ner district . &quot;
&quot; today , it is situated in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses sub@@ mer@@ dl@@ ings focus at 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insurrection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the western park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in the Hin@@ o@@ omen a smaller map with do@@ zens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; great intake &quot; , &quot; from which the property tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots are presented there today no farmers , but small @-@ gar@@ dener of the plant &quot; &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ place of the October Revolution , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete form in the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the prim@@ eval leaf in the area of today &apos;s A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen is not only reads the name &quot; &quot; Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or from the pitch &quot; &quot; on the fan &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ straße it once belonged to people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
there was in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ ch@@ ner district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; in the Au@@ er Lü@@ ch .
&quot; in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard from Gu@@ dden , led the institution - that psy@@ chi@@ ater , which is associated with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time , and ended for example the Ank@@ le of the so called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has allowed to use the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , leader of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has employed for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had been first place , later on 500 places was expanded . &quot;
&quot; sometime , this capacity will no longer be found - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k shar@@ pen@@ it@@ ary in 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per blade is located in Munich @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s biggest psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ sts in Germany . &quot;
at the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt now meet young people in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order war@@ b the building complex in 1920 and led him to a youth home with training .
&quot; west is the football field of the T@@ SV in east , east of the 1980s for the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 the children of &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; was prepared in an architectural appeal to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War by bom@@ bing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ place was around 1856 as &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 lots of holes in the city center .
a big stayed until today - by the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the German Institute , small business houses and a flo@@ or@@ atory from the Middle Ages were once at the Marien@@ hof , where these days took place and will take place on 5 April 2017 for the second S @-@ Bahn boards . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the a@@ erial view of today - and fill the hole in the Marien@@ hof . &quot;
Liber@@ ation@@ ary Group published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the national union for the promotion of color above has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s policies based on discrimin@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which should come into force by 28 August 2017 , asking special attention to A@@ fr@@ o American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ aner , as a series of frag@@ rant , rac@@ en@@ based precau@@ tions occur in recent times throughout the state and here it is stated in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law from Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder to gain discrimination , as well as prosec@@ ution bodies of the state , the dis@@ proportionate effect on minorities , promp@@ ted the group , the travel warning said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have bre@@ aches of civil rights , people are going to happen . &quot;
&quot; they are hal@@ ted because of their skin color , they are collap@@ sed or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ansas City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group quoted inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having no gas@@ oline at the beginning of the year and was taken into custo@@ dy by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without a crime . &quot;
the Council also pointed to a recent report by the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i office in which black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than women .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff will inform about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be willing to bring extra money or to know the relatives they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate speech in 2015 , according to the latest numbers from the hate @-@ breaking @-@ reporting programme of the F@@ BI , which set the state with regard to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the travel warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it harder to complain about a company because of housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ ES ) had issued prior warning for Texas and Arizona , having committed local pen@@ e@@ ability authorities to delay people because of immigration bodies , which will contribute to further seg@@ reg@@ ation view of the AC@@ LU to further seg@@ reg@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but in recent times the measure has been used as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
past@@ ure project is elementary
the Fis@@ ht@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary Peter White and Kor@@ du@@ la K@@ ovac is able to create a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the right @-@ grab@@ bers of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family met representative of the Fis@@ her@@ acher CD@@ U @-@ Locations , together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first insight into its operation , in which he managed 55 hectares meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk , and also many young animals looked after and in five apartments guests . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; black @-@ milk &quot; is for him the altern@@ less mark@@ eter for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Ferien@@ ga@@ este comes only regional .
&quot; since he is also the BL@@ H@@ V chairman of Fisch@@ her@@ ach , he referred to as &quot; elementary project as &quot; spontaneous . &quot; &quot;
I can not manage such steep areas in a profitable business .
&quot; the green space for much work , much could be edited using the engine sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he adopted the el@@ astic operation and managed these without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ is@@ ers , even if he has no bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear , &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the meaning of the course of the course of the hamlet , and is happy about the leader . &quot;
for costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are would have to support farmers .
they hope that the for@@ estation of the areas could have been removed yet for quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
farmers do not often stand in criticism due to the promotion .
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 participants have been fenced in 2013 by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; thus , the accounting area is 40 hectares , which should not be held up to at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; of the total cost of 71 EUR 500 Euro , half of the leader was promoted , a quarter carried away from the village of Fisch@@ her@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the farmers &apos; love the farmer 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of Wei@@ p@@ au@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Kor@@ du@@ la K@@ ovac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ owners do not matter . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter Weiss was fixed : &quot; &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot;
the landsc@@ ap@@ ed @-@ in @-@ law ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of grain dres@@ ses .
the goal is the offensive of the Black @-@ Forest .
prerequ@@ is@@ ites is the presence of one of the wareh@@ ouses presented .
&quot; moreover , the in@@ duc@@ ting area may not be s@@ acked up ( Hang@@ n@@ ought over 35 percent ) and must thus be threatened by the for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 we currently run the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the accounting area corresponds to 35 hectares , which are low costs of more than 112 Euro . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other , therefore , the care of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a long @-@ lasting argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by the President of the President of the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to be fair , Miller does not get the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have suffered it pun@@ ches when he had done it .
&quot; but it took its importance , and in particular the meaning that it was written , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , has been added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta comm@@ uted , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an symbol of American freedom that sh@@ ines the world . &quot;
the poem which you refer to which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is knowled@@ geable properly , but as he form@@ ulate it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about contemporary reson@@ ance on the ascen@@ ding words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not only charges any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; &quot; your breasts , your poor , / your be@@ ating masses , who looked after , free to breathe , / the el@@ ding waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time to see in which the &quot; &quot; cold waste &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot;
Miller was not engaged in liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural examination : it is indeed a conflict in the meaning of America .
&quot; Lazarus - and their friends , who took their words to place their words on the basis of their death - did so well , they made a high political action . &quot;
the sculpture should show the ties between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its poem the female figure is no longer abstr@@ actions - it has received one voice .
and she himself gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer as Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of Johannes of the dec@@ essor for the coming from Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not an end , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame into the um@@ bs world : &quot; Lady Liberty . &quot;
it is said to bear the tor@@ ches of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the F@@ ack@@ el is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something engra@@ ved .
the meaning of the statue is entirely at all a question of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted of seeing them as they had seen from the exhaus@@ tive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the Dec@@ ks of ships was seen . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of men , seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
&quot; of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever wish to recognize . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ches shall not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hat@@ red , who is their only source of power . &quot;
WH@@ C 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ gs Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle is reminded of a time when only two r@@ ots belong to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the service director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ kö@@ ping sho@@ ot@@ age cont@@ ingent in the World Cup plate has a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday . &quot;
black believes that &quot; in Scotland a little special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we figure it out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ete think it has something to do with what they did .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the guy at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ets are medals of star@@ ters , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which are delivered against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected to the team &apos;s captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is rather modest .
&quot; their surrender of surrender was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , regardless of whether they were de@@ ot@@ tically or where ever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the genuine feeling , the E@@ ili@@ ie completely naturally brought , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth of silver @-@ counter @-@ winning , which is set to compete in their 5th world Championships in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 r@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s largest number of athletes at the World Championship was seven who have been achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid@@ stream Mu@@ ir leads on this path and last year has been five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another s@@ ut@@ ch , which we got after a great season , which was included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminded of their first World Championships that was the only other Sch@@ otte in the Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the cre@@ ad@@ ors &apos; captain said that they are &quot; enormous pride &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases even with the medals and with the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; what is special about the team &apos;s surrender that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honour , but to know that my team colleagues have voted for me and chosen to make it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the r@@ ots that are part of the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we got .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to rise on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it was good . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympi@@ astadi@@ on .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will be just like a great atmosphere out there .
block of cri@@ tically about Facebook : do not block you a public office if you don &apos;t have to toler@@ ate the heating of voters
the Father of our land knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans de@@ ar@@ ded George Washington , but it didn &apos;t last long until the newspapers sw@@ allow him for all , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
he cri@@ mp in the cri@@ tique , secure . &quot;
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said Washington : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to battles . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who needs to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ endant him in the beginning of this week .
&quot; the rod of the governor sent the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Well , and ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is an Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the second @-@ highest approval of the 50 Gover@@ nor of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not an reactionary h@@ itz@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the guidance of its state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
&quot; he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and to debate its ha@@ ar@@ eless head after chemotherapy , on his side . &quot;
&quot; therefore the block@@ age of individuals who come to the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is to be officially referred to as official and by employees , which are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post ( Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse ) Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ ll@@ es or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ted people , who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post spoke to some of the real people who have been blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur , and a priest , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said their comments are respectful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest attributed the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans cath@@ olic faith .
&quot; Law@@ y@@ ro@@ at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted but she asked to hate . &quot;
&quot; I comm@@ ited pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary area of the news &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people is standing on the same theme , then they are dis@@ regarded by some more likely than a so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected people . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Gover@@ nor was &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attacks &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era is easy to cut a message , by simply blocked a critics or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much more clean than in former times when you have done the same that staff have been sent to gather newspapers with critical tails , and to burn or make demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but that is exactly what is happening .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official that cri@@ tici@@ zed about it to Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is prescribed by Twitter @-@ users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the president of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County ver@@ last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District of James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she named a vot@@ er from her fac@@ ebook @-@ side . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt fav@@ ors ( R ) also a visit from the AC@@ LU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters sm@@ ashed on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people , the pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters in newspapers , the Washington decisions made . &quot;
&quot; petition that gave its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and navigation with the UK have been overwhel@@ med by his office , according to the historical documents that were collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not have them sil@@ enced .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ classes are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in Renaissance .
&quot; the former Europeans Nr. 1 Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty will hope for the next three days on domestic comfort , as the Renaissance club is held in East Lot@@ hi@@ an the 25 edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost over the last year to the end of the Ar@@ cher@@ field links until the end of the end , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new place of Australian and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi in the name of the club @-@ up and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he reaches his glory with this event , &quot; said Raf@@ fer@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best , he is in a great state . &quot;
Jerry made a great job as he set up this place .
he is a eager supporters of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the British E@@ ales was looking forward to defending the championship for the first time , even though he won the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as it was in the year , after I had won them , taken out of the program . &quot;
return to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European Senior tour after his 50@@ th birthday in this year .
this event will be the first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
glad how it has gone .
&quot; with the trio at the field the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six r@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;

&quot; according to our estimates per year 167 of lung cancer is attri@@ but@@ able to passi@@ vity , &quot; said Pro@@ mis@@ chief Hei@@ ko B@@ echer . &quot;
when compared to his own study he moved to this topic of 1994 .
at that time there are still 400 lung cancer cases due to passi@@ vity for each year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house@@ closures prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; little less &quot; &quot; during the time &quot; , &quot; says the head of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the household closures , the situation was more complicated than suspected , as in the underground , is much mist@@ aken , which could not be noted in plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which always hin@@ dering the construction works , represents a big problem for the Bau@@ tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and bul@@ locks is enormous , &quot; &quot; reported Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z of the company St@@ ump@@ p has been busy working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were pretty much ti@@ ring .
&quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with bold mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina de@@ ei coo@@ ks the dinner cook it does not use stove .
it even uses rarely a pot .
&quot; in their wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the un@@ quiet Indon@@ esian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the st@@ ist@@ ed c@@ olle is taken with mat@@ ured , uns@@ ett@@ led hands and s@@ worn . &quot;
&quot; Deg@@ ei sits on the arm@@ rests , she has no furniture - where she also carries her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;

&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of their man , you were not assigned any fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the village of men are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody h@@ unted to &quot; &quot; bap@@ tise in the village &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life of Hochland of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , received in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 El@@ ders should vote in front of the occupation forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which applied to independence from the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta that stops control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or juris@@ dictions . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the provinces was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New gu@@ ine@@ as embr@@ aced the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning five @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transport .
&quot; the city with approximately 19.@@ 000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo , and out of wave @-@ flo@@ cks that were transformed by r@@ ust into various yellow @-@ brown t@@ ints . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esian have made their journey here , failed because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , the Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says Deg@@ ei und indicates its bu@@ stling , handmade tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker Shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indon@@ esian province where 28 % of the population lives under the poverty line and have some of the worst im@@ mortality rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the biggest and most profitable gol@@ mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a strongh@@ old town in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has built gold and copper only in 2015 alone in 2015 . &quot;
Pap@@ ua also has wooden resources in value valued 78 billion US dollars .
&quot; however , these rich@@ es are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indon@@ esian powers are a sti@@ cking presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort has paid local wag@@ ons and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars in a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ al demands on greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and become mer@@ ci@@ ent .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military . &quot;
&quot; mass@@ acre in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal @-@ land , in the 1970 @-@ 20 years have been su@@ pers@@ ist in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police in the past year lost more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; we value everything &quot; &quot; says it in a report of the dioc@@ ese Bris@@ bane from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities and torture - rape and elec@@ oms are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peace demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
bol@@ ts have reinforced since pap@@ u@@ as resources bring about an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants are changing from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ Kant@@ inen sell bath@@ ed and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ ppers . &quot;
local people are struggling to help .
&quot; the migrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the m@@ um @-@ m@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua , their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , formerly known as Jo@@ kow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign , the ine@@ qualities and the violations of violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts have been broken because we voted for Jo@@ kov@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered two months after Jo@@ kow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October a low point . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs from a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers jour@@ ne@@ yed at a motorcycle by the darkness . &quot;
the scar@@ ed children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took the impetus to her tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , who had been dr@@ unk , h@@ unted and sm@@ ote the group with their v@@ om@@ bs , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to find that he fell into the Com@@ a . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby governmental commission was set in fire and escal@@ ate things next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football field before the local police station and the military com@@ man@@ o@@ centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried out cerem@@ onial hunting ar@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ singing - of Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to strike stones on police and military post .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers was sent a command via an internal Fun@@ k : &quot; if the masses went more than three times , they shoot it dead , &quot; said it is not released in an official document of T@@ IME , which was not released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ h@@ itting danger and called for rest and called the amount to return home . &quot;
nobody was hearing in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned myself , I suddenly turned into my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said T@@ IME on the veranda of his colour@@ ful wooden building . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who has been folded , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded ; many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; adds he added . &quot;
&quot; the locals man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who bears as many Indon@@ esian only one name , the T@@ IME in d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the che@@ ek@@ spec@@ tor of Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said re@@ por@@ ters that his officers &quot; wanted to secure their station &quot; , &quot; because they shall be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were wo@@ unded . &quot;
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings arrived only the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jo@@ kow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ am to address the historical ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case will be resolved right away , so that in the future it will no longer happen , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; safety Minister Wir@@ anto was said in October 2016 , that he has conven@@ ed a non @-@ judicial mechanism to apply historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most injury are encountered a long time ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be under@@ going through , &quot; he said . &quot;
then he made a withdrawal as he spoke on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with T@@ IME and said he did not set any plans in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism .
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; land@@ anto , indic@@ ted by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases demanded from human rights ab@@ uses in Ost@@ tim@@ ors , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua have already been attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ victims took such claims with gri@@ ff@@ ness .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I fear , being arrested by the military , have fear , shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says he was be@@ aten by the military , after he was helping four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military looked after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the found@@ ries have not stopped .
on Tuesday night the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital , died a person and 17 others were wo@@ unded , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
ranked vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the sit@@ ing office of the company .
&quot; the police said , that the vill@@ agers were stones on officers , who re@@ acted upon it , putting it down warning . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ it@@ ary police ) began to shoot at the amount of shooting and killed .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness as the wo@@ unded is quickly supplied here , so the T@@ IME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to hold the involved officers on account and retreat the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police in the field .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ h@@ eh@@ er@@ d for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bal men , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i , and Dam@@ al , who live in the green highlands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by fighting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of in@@ don@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ ary in custo@@ dy under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will never dive again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is expensive for locals too expensive . &quot;
bread is as out as range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to be able to edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
&quot; they retain the bulk of harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
ten pieces Not@@ a precious only 10,000 Indon@@ esian R@@ up@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since opening new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in greater numbers . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better trained and prosp@@ erous migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua have rarely seen the capital or the necessary skills to competitive their own business .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , limitations of reporting international media remain tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the French journalist Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp was de@@ ported because of poor coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they gave them the rare permission to the films . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the assistant Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the inter@@ pret@@ ations of Jo@@ kov@@ is El@@ ection , to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , not realised . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esian in un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific States - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ as Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread infring@@ ements &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai berries . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian State Department of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r dismis@@ sed the alleg@@ ations of the group , and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still holds a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to tu@@ alize the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right amb@@ assador K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura was visited on May 4 , the locals fled their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia still has a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not be able to vote for Jo@@ kow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ kow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jo@@ kov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ People , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a pure military military , is found in im@@ pover@@ ished education and health services . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider her voice to Jo@@ kow@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ope brought a last symbolic act of f@@ ool : the body of an offering was buried in a terrain just across the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never come into justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a fresh head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrapers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest dwelling of the world in Dubai in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ stor@@ ey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that runs in just two years through the sky@@ scr@@ aper , which one is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evac@@ u@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we were up with fire alarm , and in the writing of the people . &quot;
&quot; we fell down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down , and told a resident who spoke to his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said , that the units of fire fight against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building burned down . &quot;
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
&quot; the incident can also be used for safety of materials , which are used in outer areas of sky@@ scrapers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; an examination by the management of the tor@@ ch building after whose fire in 2015 revealed that the largest portion of the damages from the cl@@ adding , the outside cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates to isol@@ ate and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ ch meeting , where approximately 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) is with its big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h city , the support for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single single was still supported on two winn@@ ings , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the necessary two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; this is often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ set @-@ classics remain the tradition of tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore not just missing . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
they will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; even before that the proposal had already come to vote , the final on a neutral country had already arrived . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively minor details , so the fin@@ alists of the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will continue to have the hosts in the first round in the first round . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the costs for the organizer , the requirements in terms of training etc. are reli@@ eved and the players will need to be able to complete the Davis Cup less official media events before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers brings forth objects to the plane , finds a survey . &quot;
&quot; a survey among passengers passengers found that more than 20 percent are aware or un@@ consciously noted items to the check@@ points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which bet@@ tered the aircraft , while they conc@@ eal wi@@ dened kni@@ ves or other items with sword . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent asser@@ ted , they have been del@@ ayed that they have traveled down with fire@@ arms , am@@ muni@@ tion or explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the survey with more than 1,000 people - the by a jet charter service , the STR@@ ATOS Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was carried out - presented also that younger travellers are rather ab@@ used the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents said that they w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that were banned by the T@@ SA , were 19,@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items , which were chi@@ ef@@ ly se@@ ated to T@@ SA agents , were food and liqui@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent added to , wis@@ ely items with blade carried by the safety control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents , and 3,@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they were inten@@ tionally promised drugs into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , it has asked travelers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers had brought by the airport security and how many things were done . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that the people , the most likely sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware - kno@@ w@@ ingly , or ignor@@ ant - by the safety carry , those were the most frequently flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company has pointed out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uns@@ ure which flu@@ ids they may take with them or how much of it .
&quot; so , there is no surprise that the biggest quantity of the T@@ SA conf@@ isc@@ ated articles are displ@@ aced by the T@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; a time long , the people thought the T@@ SA could view books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers stor@@ ing order
electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to have a huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ estimated that a part of the customer has reg@@ ained their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ant numbers at revenue gains and even more gigantic sales aim , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time bet@@ ray a different , less @-@ lac@@ tic number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often applied more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery starts . &quot;
&quot; now , mus@@ k Mus@@ k : from the total of 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre@@ orders have already been re@@ trac@@ ted . &quot;
critics had always pointed out that these are only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; on a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in Great Britain 1000 Po@@ unds ) . &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ ,000 such un@@ binding reservations before , showed Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; although the cancellation of so far around 12 percent of all orders could be made to the problem , the Tes@@ la chef does not believe . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth aim is not on demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 it should be contrac@@ ted together - 50@@ 0.000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , currently per day 1800 reservations are added . &quot;
&quot; who now ordered a &quot; model 3 &quot; , &quot; may already be reck@@ oned in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la it creates , its brand @-@ new , has never been tested in practice , without greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utilization . &quot;
many experts have doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to greater delays , then the ir@@ ability of reservations could become the problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not hin@@ ders un@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves . &quot;

the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal back for the P@@ ru@@ ding regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; the Federal District Court in Washington has decided that the EPA approved his authority as he tried to pursue the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , oil and gas corporations to monitor and reducing meth@@ an@@ lec@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ ke suggested that his turn@@ around at Oz@@ on@@ standards very simply achieved the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely execution of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; among former administr@@ ations , the EPA often has not adher@@ ed the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to set out by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement reached the appointment for the implementation , &quot; P@@ ru@@ ke said the EPA said more than a dozen time in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by trial procedures , and we take dates seriously . &quot;
we also accept the law and authority that gives us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless the opinion of EPA said that P@@ ru@@ ster will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and any other legal ordin@@ ances &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid politics and the best information available . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a comprehensive re @-@ reaching new version of the o@@ zone .
a last month approved law was to delay the implementation of the rules in 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet to be agreed in the Senate .
&quot; the New York general manager of Eric Sch@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states who had said the EPA in this week , said the Group intended to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.6 million New York and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g which flows into their communities , &quot; said cutting . &quot;
&quot; in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; ground @-@ Oz@@ on is born , when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refined , chemical structures and other sources in the atmosphere are responding to sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the remote Smo@@ g can cause sensitive groups of people to cause serious respir@@ atory problems , and help each year to thousands of premature deaths . &quot;
representatives of the public health care and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ ding &apos;s change .
&quot; it is disturbing , how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of air we are inv@@ alu@@ able , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to continue to fight against the ide@@ ological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to adapt to environmental pollution and their special interests . &quot;

society wants to release permission of Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ ers
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; &quot; does not see legal conditions for building and has therefore turned to the council . &quot;
&quot; the Association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; &quot; has promp@@ ted Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to increase its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is un@@ law@@ ful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved as at the time in Vier@@ sen just on the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal an wind power @-@ concentration zone exists .
&quot; within this concentration area , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time the concentr@@ ations of concentration however brings an increase in wind energy use for the resi@@ dual city area . &quot;
such zones are to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power@@ train zone in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but had not approved the District government in Düsseldorf , because of a fault error . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal conditions the author@@ is@@ ations of permits remains un@@ law@@ ful and therefore also with@@ standing , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
current status of things : the city council entered again the wind @-@ concentration zone in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; an approval of the District government is still pending .
&quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; this is at this place the issu@@ ing of an approval for the establishment of wind turbines , legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been made in the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; stated a spokes@@ person . &quot;
the circle she takes on the occasion to check the matter once again .
they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with a view to the ongoing proceedings at the administrative Court , the circle was not re@@ vered with the reason@@ ing of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build up a surface at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette building up of four depending on the construction of four ( 200 meters high wind ) . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company had participated in which the city is Vier@@ sen indirectly involved with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of great terrain . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of roughly 11 400 households can be set up - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity demand of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest about 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sens Stad@@ el@@ ded green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen as well as a stake in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor kra@@ n together : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at the L 333 between Nieder@@ s@@ men@@ ach and B@@ ing ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was fatal .
two other people were slightly wo@@ unded .
the national road remained locked over hours .
&quot; according to police officers , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch were driving out with her car during the accompanied driving with her 53 @-@ year mother as a companion to the L 333 in the direction of B@@ ing . &quot;
town and distributors are planning &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ ore &quot; weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region should re@@ discover the shops in the city in September .
&quot; the Commercial Club and the municipal authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September , in order to attract residents for the shopping @-@ stroll into the city centre . &quot;
&quot; as the chair of the profession , Christian König , announced the &quot; home Sh@@ ells &quot; &quot; weekend the customers should raise awareness about what offers its own city aside from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional vendors , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are supposed to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the inner city should be inviting . &quot;
the action is not limited to inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
&quot; in preparation , adverti@@ sers in the radio , an internet video and printed bag , refer to the Ak@@ tions @-@ weekend , so Christian king . &quot;
city administration and commercial organisation cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Commerce .
&quot; in order to enter the business club and the city into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ ts downtown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers like the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ feast and sold Sunday , talks with all trad@@ es@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
&quot; also attractive offers on Saturday and the or@@ naments for parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potenti@@ als have new or repeat@@ ed@@ ely closed . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
&quot; but also many locals would have lost the city center at shopping , at a glance . &quot;
&quot; in the end , all of them would need to in@@ vigor@@ ate the inner city - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it landed , to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy which made itself partly , had said the king in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stri@@ ch , leader of the Chamber of Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared with that , on the nation@@ wide third &quot; home Sh@@ ore &quot; -@@ day , first five Thur@@ ingi@@ an cities participate . &quot;
&quot; besides Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ lighter . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ ves to promote the appreciation of local trade and place its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot;
the action under the spring of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can be influenced with his department &apos;s department of purchase .

&quot; amongst the dead , it was a representative of the school . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ fortunate , the authorities suspected the authorities working on a gas line . &quot;
there are only a few people staying in the building of Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tru@@ mp continued after mess@@ ed tran@@ scription by phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and guides of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27th , Tru@@ mp called on a telephone with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President accused him , because he had publicly dismis@@ sed the wall . he said to him , &quot; This is what you cannot say to the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern edge of the United States , and to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first attempt by the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and un@@ covered a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees who hi@@ ked to Australia , &quot; &quot; le@@ ash &quot; &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; would allow him to look like a &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; , &quot; after having suggested a ban of res@@ ett@@ lement from refugees to the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call , after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ mass@@ acre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury was carried out by a group of spect@@ ators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ ank to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ bs to block its path . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous move - took a long train to his cig@@ ar , and looked after the wind@@ shield . &quot;
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; bro@@ ods the man .
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; write scre@@ ams the silence , as a young black man made by the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , only a post @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; is thrown , almost all in the audience very real si@@ gh out . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 citizens have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no @-@ one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it is really un@@ think@@ able that in all these years there was no one person arrested , although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in organising the course . &quot;
&quot; it is a strainer on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old congress of parliament of Georgia and a life long citizen .
&quot; for him , the post @-@ position is considered a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe community that a injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal tracking , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a judicial physician puts a du@@ b on the cor@@ pse one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files , which were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were made from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding county . &quot;
but no one has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on the un@@ rest for decades , they say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 he made a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , in the pre @-@ election campaign in summer . &quot;
&quot; at the same time as choosing st@@ ach , according to information of the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ächter Roger Mal@@ com a white land owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - said to be because of a woman . &quot;
Bro@@ oks said the smells in the city has been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby he carried away not by her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owners , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when she took away from the prison and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , ring@@ ring a Lyn@@ ch mo@@ b the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that has prepared the Mor@@ de , and arranged it into a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also evident that there was a conspir@@ acy between state and local criminal prosec@@ ution , which was not only involved in the mor@@ den , evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a elec@@ toral @-@ mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
&quot; nearly a decade long , Cass@@ andra has led the annual retro@@ placement of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their presentation is vi@@ vid , touching and is justified in a kind of deep racism then many believe that in America it does not exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to look , and even harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we will then face all of us with H@@ äs@@ s@@ fulness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I did . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen woman and the rest bl@@ acks - in a space and lau@@ ght as a Gre@@ ene launched a well @-@ played view over the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of the Chief C@@ lan@@ co gli@@ eds for years , but he said , the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so am , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to preserve this story in life , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester and ur@@ ges it , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , w@@ aver from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona aired the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least every black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs on the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ y &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think that white people at that time &quot; &quot; n --- he &quot; said . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yet , &quot; funny one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy in space , a sense of compani@@ onship , replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are writer , shots , and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , cloth@@ ed with a grape dress , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and introduces Bil@@ ly Holidays en@@ ing praise &quot; &quot; Str@@ ange Fru@@ it &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it caught a group of about four dozen viewers swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost even@@ ly between black and white .
&quot; a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , anger@@ ed to see the performance , many come just down the road . &quot;
they have experienced every almost eight hours of Georgi@@ as pressing moisture when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de has stayed an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you place on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de place , feels the air star@@ table . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to get closer and to insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name . &quot;
children ho@@ cken at their heads , register the counter@@ feit blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ ky a little boy , as if he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors have throwing the Lyn@@ ch silk and w@@ rought their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ ded Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ co . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ ded two of his fellow players and then collap@@ ses into her arms , the emotional burden of the performance and eventually breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s ok , whis@@ per@@ ed one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience will get together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
on a table chat a white pair of Atlanta stimul@@ ated about the im@@ position with a black pair that she has just met .
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ sky fought hard to find words , which left the performance . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people like you and who do it , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what that really does with me is letting me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still continuing , &quot; she added , &quot; today , the only police shooting is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the lead in the next year .
&quot; the im@@ position is in a way inspir@@ ational because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &apos; irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ed the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental works , director Frank Cast@@ orf continues to be a colorful fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging in front of gigantic , six @-@ stor@@ ey scenery . &quot;
&quot; the rotating stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows op@@ tionally a s@@ hab@@ by street with a wall rest and d@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from DDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the Rhein@@ h@@ esti@@ cks are pos@@ ing in rock , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
cliffs of oil cl@@ ut@@ ors remember Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - that draws through its &quot; ring &quot; -@@ st@@ aging . &quot;
the three tur@@ k@@ ish - sang by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ieren as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
&quot; we owe it Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , crus@@ hing in Hollywood man@@ ier a cor@@ pse in the trunk and enter the Kra@@ w@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the mar@@ vel@@ ous h@@ agen which surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene than he suggests Sieg@@ fried .
later we also have to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus Ei@@ che ) .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; stor@@ my is celebrated Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Di@@ conductor Jan@@ owski , who form@@ ulate its hum@@ ble and hands on the Merkel Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; large appl@@ ause , there is for the play@@ boy , which shows for the first time on stage - given the big heat back into casual wear . &quot;
I was expected to see the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to make an amazing whi@@ stling concert in 2013 , there were five years later big che@@ ers , in which the &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased about it .
&quot; you notice that the audience is grown with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , had it just before the performance of the d@@ pa said . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also a understanding of its view . &quot;
I wrote a positive respect .

&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; you are now 26 years , that is a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
quantity : I made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a building @-@ engineering , we say nothing succ@@ urs@@ ed successfully . &quot;
&quot; I realized that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , working with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what you make .
&quot; a social year , as there is an insight , there you can see how it is locally , in the burning perhaps also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter term for my studies in the social @-@ term .
&quot; I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t H@@ erne a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not something unusual during the volunteer service to have several different locations ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it depends probably always on where to make his F@@ S@@ J .
it can make it from anti@@ qu@@ sheim up to the youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very diversi@@ fied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me that was exactly what I have mat@@ ured .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really exp@@ ires .
unlike in the building &apos;s degree program ?
&quot; amount : well sure , here it is not about to convert st@@ atics . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people a head , each with a very different story behind him . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been picked up out of the family - you have to always go individually to it . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not be in touch ?
&quot; quantity : for this , I am not the guy . &quot;
there is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , much kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so life is . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son is cut further 3,000 jobs and shorter the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business . &quot;
&quot; the British Education Group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure by which the company is confronted . &quot;
&quot; the job @-@ making , the Direc@@ torate @-@ director John Fall@@ on predominantly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan for rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement of another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in order to revi@@ ve a business back by fast step to digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company that has expressed his participation in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House on the Partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it reached an increase of 1 percent to 2,@@ 05 billion € in the first half . &quot;
Kon@@ vo@@ i @-@ attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in DIY
&quot; a self @-@ folder has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , who killed soldiers of Nato and several others are in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and a transl@@ ator were wo@@ unded , divided a declaration of Nato . &quot;
&quot; according to local reports , according to the incident in the district Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also three civilians . &quot;
the bom@@ bing is the final violence involved in Afghanistan - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday there was a self @-@ log@@ ged two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of Nato , the explosion on Thursday night has happened , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; by persons of worn in@@ visi@@ oned explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot; &quot;
the statement b@@ urses that all wo@@ unded in a stable state are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital on the field of Bag@@ ram .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there was a minimum of 1.6@@ 62 civilian deaths , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a su@@ ic@@ ide auto@@ om@@ be at least 30 people in an princip@@ ally Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they would have done this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , an enormous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city increased more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 the Taliban from power . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since the US President Donald Tru@@ mp was@@ hes out the number of US troops to increase military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents said that the self @-@ folders in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policy and in particular in the reputation of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA makes decision to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule to Kl@@ agen
&quot; the US @-@ American environmental authority has a decision to delay the regulation by the Obama administration , consul@@ ted that the states are obliged to ab@@ ide by the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 countries def@@ endants the Agency because of the ped@@ est@@ rians . &quot;
&quot; EPA announced late on Wednesday to further advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Fair 2015 , &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; said T @-@ Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June the EPA announced the intention of EPA announced that should be measured in a part of the country poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions , in which to adhere to stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , held on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to reg@@ ain a wide range of environmental guidelines , which has imposed the former president of Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have triggered the provisions of Democrats and reserves to worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of the EPA tells that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function , and the breathing changes can be increased , such as as@@ thma . &quot;
municipalities wants common areas
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts the municipal council of cur@@ orn @-@ win@@ egro@@ wers the establishment of a communal area in the future senior residence . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing piece of property was signed , wrote Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will still take , until the so far the church collection were in the common ownership , but there is now no plan@@ det@@ ention center for that of a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common area .
&quot; one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , has offered to the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , he would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters area for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and majority of the municipal council fail to look at such a common room , not only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ical living room , but open to the church . &quot;
&quot; for example , the word from the &quot; &quot; kn@@ itted café &quot; &quot; took place . &quot;
reconc@@ iled the decision that by providing funds for the current budget has already been decided in the last autumn .
the building is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be , so reports T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent are eligible . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ making proposal is to sign@@ alize the investor that it doesn &apos;t want to throw a so@@ wing between the legs , finding out that both saddle and pe@@ ek - which reduces the foot@@ ing and the construction of economic power - can be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this supplement . &quot;
when &apos;s helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the Panel .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings with whom you are not so progres@@ sing , so it is now in the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I feel hard with it . &quot;
Yvonne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it a covered sub @-@ invention in any case @-@ like or even foreign investors .
&quot; if this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no grant to grant , but keep a real , in a doubt @-@ market object , the bac@@ kl@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s application , to raise the decision @-@ up , will find three advocates . &quot;
&quot; so it stays with two items in the original program that said Stefan H@@ all so together : &quot; &quot; if we grasp the decision , we make a huge step there to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the Mün@@ ch@@ ens Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ jen Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance within the team . &quot;
that was last not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old does not believe in performance in the first official install@@ ment of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows this qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the score is sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spect@@ ators , distributed the German football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
in the resin from star to star
in the resin it is supposed to be the nation@@ wide first &quot; star trail . &quot;
this is planning the association observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary path exists in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; come to the information of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , was called it . &quot;
&quot; connecting nature , Science , exercise and spor@@ ty performance . &quot;
members want to place the members along the planned route and inform them about stars and constell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase up to 2018 , the association plans to reach well @-@ reaching installations at five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question came to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber &quot;
the information on the boards should be suppl@@ emented by internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception is playing a good mobile network . &quot;
also accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ base path should be extended by train .
&quot; on the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad the spect@@ ator experienced much knowledge @-@ value , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; declared the association . &quot;
they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star stronger than another , although he is much further away . &quot;
&quot; it will also be convey@@ ed in which constell@@ ation should be a chosen star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
the association has been running in the Berg@@ städ@@ t St. Andre@@ as@@ berg mountain in Germany since 2014 .
the site in the middle of the national park Har@@ z counts according to the Federal Republic of Har@@ z for the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y are clearly visible to see .
in the university city there has been a bit of simil@@ arities since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen was something similar to the planned star ...
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ all@@ ee , which forms the inside of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial location &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( community tracks ) with the planet S@@ edn@@ a . &quot;
the ri@@ mp@@ s with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Pl@@ uto at the end point - are exactly at distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth is shr@@ unk so on a sphere of 6,@@ 5 milli@@ meters diameter , whereas the exact 75 meters away is about 70 cen@@ timeters . &quot;
the entire distance from the planet is a good four kilometers .
&quot; while the light needed from sun to Pl@@ uto about eight hours , ped@@ est@@ rians need a good hour until the st@@ ele with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
ped@@ est@@ rians are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star but would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time in discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , which should stand in a coll@@ isions to staged the most thri@@ lling box@@ ing in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the illeg@@ i@@ lag@@ ene World Box@@ ing Council Li@@ ghtw@@ ay to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ fe@@ ather champion . &quot;
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through one @-@ part decision on the former four @-@ divisions @-@ world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ n on Saturday at Show@@ time are both fighters members of the top Five Po@@ und for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How does it go to you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple of pictures ordered , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is climate , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I am ascen@@ ded for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to walk up light weight .
and he must move to Li@@ weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
they require the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko was voting .
&quot; box@@ ing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per view , part of a strategy that will fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 pounds @-@ debut in this year to make an appointment in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) that also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight @-@ title competition in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and oppressed them later to fight with the network which offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he ow@@ enko as &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held on with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side is very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you want to be the co @-@ Off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show head@@ lines , then box@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; both said , they could feel the momentum that built himself up for the own struggle . &quot;
&quot; this is the battle , which has to be performed . &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I waited for the top fighters and that is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four Ver@@ sion@@ ers after tire @-@ space
&quot; in case of an accident on the A7 , four people were badly in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; after first information , the driver lost a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira at 16.@@ 30 p.m. shortly before the junction of market width was probably following an tire space after his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the truck was cast towards the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he turned over and then remained on the roof of the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ STRE@@ IF@@ EN . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were badly in@@ ju@@ red at the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the wo@@ unded by the lif@@ ebo@@ at service , the A7 was locked up in the direction of the north for about one hour , then the traffic on the left margin could pass through the accident at the accident . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoff@@ mann : &quot; Trinity is better &quot;
Andre Hoff@@ mann hopes after the 2 : 2 for the season opening off against Br@@ uns@@ wick that the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points brings .
&quot; with the first start of the season , Andre Hoff@@ mann was happy with the result , would not have been the two oppos@@ ers at 2 : 2 against Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ore too much , and we have to adjust even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defen@@ ders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Ore Mountains the tri@@ ples also will continue to be optimized .
and a gate after an free@@ wheel would not want to catch the For@@ tun@@ es too .
&quot; for the future , it will be that no longer exists beside Michael ( R@@ ensing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoff@@ mann is convinced that his team fails to better cope with the experiences in preparation with the three @-@ nec@@ kl@@ ace , than with the four @-@ four . &quot;
&quot; I do not know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoff@@ mann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just been able to build on the semi @-@ positions of KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build good . &quot;
&quot; a prerequisite is , but that we can make even better harmon@@ i@@ ously and we do not make it as much play@@ back in building . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoff@@ mann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; however , if one cannot speak of a mis@@ guided start , do not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; but in case we can start on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season . &quot;
it wanted to know nothing about that .
&quot; the start into the season I do not prejudi@@ ce after six to eight players days , who would not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken pre@@ matur@@ ely because of an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoff@@ mann believes that players from Au@@ e might have even something fresh , since they could have no heavy and complete play such as Fort@@ una to a ascen@@ sion @-@ favor@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % , where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inside of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , guests from the Rhin@@ eland as a slight favorite on Sunday into the encounter in the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take them away , only because we are entitled to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ anity &quot; , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there are no crew in the second Bundes@@ liga , which we must hit from the outset , &quot; &quot; For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot;
such a statement to meet would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ tly .
and so he wants to never experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ holder tests published
&quot; recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for for@@ en@@ ic medicine ( R@@ ät@@ t@@ sm@@ e@@ dic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started with the implementation of the tests last year .
&quot; they are to make more exact during the asylum seeker in the assessment of the age , after the Swedish migrants authority ( Mig@@ rations up@@ et ) because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees were cri@@ tici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; up to date , mig@@ rations up@@ ted 6,@@ 8@@ 80 has been ma@@ iled and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency were condemned that the person &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 432 , the conclusion is that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are made only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are permanent during the past months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high percentage of cases where the person has been judged for over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has wei@@ gh@@ ed over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the sub @-@ sear@@ ched person was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 published results showed that in 243 these cases the person had said , that they will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in X @-@ rays of wisdom @-@ teeth and MR@@ T recordings are analysed by knee in@@ ists , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
to assess the biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
&quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended however the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general you can say that the risk , a child as an adult is un@@ correct , low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is in it if the person is just under 18 , in this case this is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
full in plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons of heavy concrete emphasis was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going well , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , buil@@ ders at the department of street and traffic in the government of the si@@ dium Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the works at the same time began on all three gentle bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
construction is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a dom@@ ed bridge made of concrete , which is disgu@@ ised with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total @-@ length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it is now in the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to guarantee the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished . &quot;
the two other bridges run through the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance to Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning at the north side a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called brid@@ les . &quot;
&quot; it is a ri@@ ver@@ ation , which is also used as a run @-@ away . &quot;
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a surprisingly meter width should be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian streets would be gone .
&quot; the special thing is that these are the production parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented lo@@ op@@ holes .
particular Finger@@ print feeling has made the wir@@ ing of wir@@ ing through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; for there is also a fibre cable , connected to which many firms are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed beforehand about the project in advance of the works .
&quot; in addition , fish and canc@@ ers had to be distr@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building building and the ren@@ dez@@ v@@ ous in direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by an amp@@ el . &quot;
&quot; for the construction on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village , the road is fully locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the Hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den . &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three brid@@ ging is equivalent to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in German Pot@@ ato sal@@ at
&quot; it is not so frequent to pull parties to a rope , but if it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , what else is difficult to bring down to a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a wide alliance that shows on this day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell ac@@ claimed to the &quot; &quot; big elec@@ toral campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and called well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which formed together with Alexander Gau@@ land , the top duo for the German Bundestag on the 24th of September , and the dep@@ uty chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ for@@ s but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains b@@ unt . &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain grounds , but now takes place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and therefore right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ ales event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a bun@@ cle image that gives itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forum A World and one of the author@@ it@@ ative organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D , &quot; &quot; says the woman who has brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have occupied many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how is the Af@@ D came to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ ales volcano @-@ cube , he tried to get such an event and get the supplement . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had in demand first in Dau@@ n , but there was not enough parking places there because of the already being built in Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell &apos;@@ Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; overlooking the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : from 8 p.m. on the deck @-@ site a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ leader Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall are about 200 listen@@ ers who are waiting for the top support for the German Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of The Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the police present is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; something more than one hour takes the Af@@ ales event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there it is short after 21 hrs . &quot;
the police may abr@@ ate - no special pre@@ conditions .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; we listen to the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ ster@@ concert tomorrow , Sunday at 8 pm in the Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian Tromp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov there is a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore , &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in the bladder music . &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have Sol@@ opo@@ si@@ cs in European top @-@ class .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both united the desire , not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments but to merge the boundaries of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; like Johann Sebastian Bach this sounds like in a new atti@@ re , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music , &quot; united with Bulgarian Folklore , and in the piece of &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ mb@@ al N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram , mix up classical , jazz and the free games to a fascinating whole artwork . &quot;
this center@@ piece of the program was produced only this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the prestigious composer N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram wrote it for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with their special acou@@ sti@@ cs is consciously taken into the concert .
cri@@ b Stew@@ art talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese , and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I would like to try everything , &quot; &quot; says Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art quite openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; when I cook in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of the Dutch stars was the one to her &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately was bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all the assur@@ ances the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ ement opposite the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was very seriously betra@@ yed that I have taken . &quot;
&quot; or do you think about , I have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation there was cri@@ es that they bis@@ ex@@ ual , &quot; &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and seriously believed it . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I only liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them did they get loud &quot; &quot; Bang show &quot; &quot; but at school time when she &apos;d rather like a be@@ b : &quot; not all the girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been har@@ med me .
&quot; when I was eleven , I had told me the kids , I would look like a bug . &quot;
I really felt attacked and frigh@@ tened and as@@ ham@@ ed .
&quot; now , I look back and think to me : &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the general public they don &apos;t like to love their love life , &quot; the people expect you to agree on a certain way and the angry me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some describe me a few times , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the public . &quot;
the governor of West Virginia is announ@@ cing that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night with a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and many things ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in rejo@@ icing .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the republi@@ cans , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp was previously mentioned a HU@@ GE announcement in the West Virginia r@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice won &apos;t endor@@ sed the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the country was voted in 2016 .
&quot; For@@ bes presents that he owns Kohl@@ em@@ inen in five states , and has inherited a carbon business by his father . &quot;
it is worth about 1,@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday night was an explanation , in which it said , &quot; The Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather rise to us than working towards our country . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 staff and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is merely the last rejection of a party which is from top to below without leadership and unable to find a positive , reasonably message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
co@@ e lo@@ gs &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for d@@ oping @-@ sc@@ andal
&quot; the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ologi@@ an from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal but he repeated it is not the moment for the country to be included in the sport . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics Chef Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin at the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he is determined to fight the D@@ oping .
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were away from competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments the IA@@ AF Congress held responsible for the maintenance of the For@@ bidden , which was held in November 2015 after a report of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) indications of state subsidi@@ zed D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was today a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ por@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realized itself , that they have experienced some very hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; he said he was also &quot; pleased , &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything over the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principle ration@@ ale always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the mixed system , &quot; he added
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes are beginning at the athle@@ tics World Championship , which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia will still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; Dro@@ ger tests are still inadequate and har@@ ass@@ ing trainers are still free , he said re@@ por@@ ters in London after a talk at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
grape @-@ tract for in Mali cr@@ ashed soldiers
&quot; at a trau@@ mas party in the northe@@ ast@@ ern Fr@@ itz@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two at a helic@@ opter overthrow in Mali in@@ comes soldiers . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
to the yet un@@ enligh@@ tened def@@ ender said Defence Minister Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) nothing .
&quot; they referred to the two in@@ comes pil@@ ots , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their professional . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we tend to be of this highest victim , that they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany &quot; , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year St@@ ah@@ er@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their sa@@ vi@@ ge were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a Tot@@ en@@ closure of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
&quot; at the mid@@ day , only the relatives were in the church at first . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the funeral party began in the circle of the family , narrow friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
including H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general spec@@ tors of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; the grapes are covered with ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in the arm at the sa@@ vi@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers had the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defence from the Ley@@ en , signed the in@@ comes soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and registered . &quot;
the St@@ et@@ aup@@ t@@ mann appointed the flight operation of the Kampf@@ h@@ ub@@ Ring Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar with up and was one of the first six formed tiger drivers of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Com@@ man@@ ders of the Reg@@ iment , to whom the soldiers belong , &quot; &quot; if these crew couldn &apos;t turn the crash , it could not have missed . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali demonstrated the minister of Ley@@ en no : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; for a country where we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral service the legend were brought from the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr alone made no data . &quot;
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik wants no grave alongside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants not to be buried after his death next to his wife . &quot;
the shared the Royal House on Thursday with .
traditionally the Danish Royal King is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard fer@@ ed already a Sar@@ k@@ oph@@ ag for the two .
&quot; the Queen be agreed with the decision of her husband , it meant to be further in the message . &quot;
where Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik will be buried , be still unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to put together a purpose in his French homeland .
&quot; Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik never made a sense of it , that he was not happy with his title . &quot;
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would gladly become king .
in 2016 he went to retirement and also places the title of &quot; prin@@ cess . &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark does not have the title and the function he wanted to see himself as equal to his wife , even after death , L@@ ene Ball@@ eby is the Chief of the Danish Royal House . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting @-@ year of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be put into his French land , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked for over the past 50 years .
&quot; born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ ocr@@ acy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
on the Thames he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later woman the sympath@@ iz@@ ations of the people always flew , Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 years of age . &quot;
in a auto@@ biography of Hen@@ rik on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did .
&quot; my Danish was s@@ ank@@ ing , I preferred wine instead of beer , Seiden@@ str@@ ur@@ fs instead of cor@@ k so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of soci@@ etal intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not as@@ ham@@ ed .
these were just two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l aims for quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; defe@@ atism Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) is after the loss of red @-@ green ch@@ ess@@ ness for a quick re @-@ election of the day of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ist . &quot;
it was said to be on Friday for the resolution of the parliament .
previously the surprising resign@@ ation of a Green parliament@@ arians from their country @-@ day fr@@ actions in Lower Saxony the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) were over@@ thrown into a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the official date of the country @-@ election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ cast majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Gre@@ ens MP El@@ ke Laz@@ ne welcomed its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Des@@ erts ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hannover . &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ ac@@ sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to record them .
&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP could have 69 seats in the lower farm , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is elected regular on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government now decide whether they could gover@@ n in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l does however , however , considers in@@ compar@@ ably that the country decides to justify its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the country @-@ Constitution also sees the possibility that the governor of the Prime Minister rel@@ ies the trust and elect a success@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities must be tested correctly , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; it will be deb@@ ated in peace to all questions , if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ West@@ ens step &quot; but something qu@@ aint .
&quot; the political lady itself stressed : &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she referred to as a pend@@ ant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the Ab@@ ün@@ enberg representatives to return their Land@@ sc@@ andal .
&quot; of course we assume that she has received her land@@ lady , which has received her about the green country list , shared with immediate effect , the number of Met@@ a J@@ ans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of Als@@ ace . &quot;
they have chosen deliberately to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; even against the background that there were no contents of any dispute , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ y@@ al council .
&quot; the behavior of the former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al of the elec@@ torate , but also betra@@ y@@ al of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; wrote the Bundes@@ chief of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) , to let the Land@@ tag quickly re @-@ elected . &quot;
the resign@@ ation T@@ wes@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; political leader &quot; &quot; in their last van@@ ity and in their frustration , their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; cri@@ tici@@ zed SPD @-@ Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ tri@@ cher and tries to beat out of political capital .
down@@ war@@ sens CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ ac@@ sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its members to accommodate El@@ ke T@@ ants into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ west before , with personal career offer the result of the country @-@ day choice in 2013 to fal@@ si@@ fy . &quot;

&quot; Land@@ sm@@ in@@ ister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ver , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed with si@@ ghing eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Land@@ sm@@ in@@ ister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is talking in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) speech and response .
Mr Schmidt : how can the consumer protect against po@@ ison eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumers who watch the Eg@@ gs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ .net the Bundes@@ länder@@ constitute the latest information on the affected egg @-@ char@@ ms .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; also , if after all we know currently , a health haz@@ ard is virtually excluded . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di the best possible crisis haz@@ ard , all eggs are out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ ten@@ ers of the federal government is not really perceived ? &quot;
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been placed immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and the risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; the trade has the same as the makers to carry it worry , that the goods selling products are in@@ capable and health @-@ harmless . &quot;
&quot; if with eggs of the high @-@ level content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg exceeded , these are not restricted . &quot;
un@@ contaminated eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not the factory to blame .
sitting operations and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; following the time @-@ to @-@ date , the production is not an immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must count on account of mut@@ in@@ ally illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is little control in the har@@ vesting on little contro@@ l@@ le@@ ure .
is it only missing from the personnel or on the bad jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , there was just the am@@ en@@ able controls that have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth also belongs to that food fraud and criminal energy can never be eliminated by 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; precisely this is a consequ@@ ent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ution in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can occur , of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have already clearly stated several times that I expect a seam@@ less education by the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular alarm m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer &apos;s consumer and consumers have the right to get only safe and easy @-@ to @-@ handle foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ cured insec@@ ti@@ cide in the food sector is used , consumer &apos;s consumer and consumer are rightly disgu@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; by the pan@@ ed means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ law@@ ful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cides Fi@@ pron@@ il in attitude of food foods is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
it has to be consistent with high pressure on all levels .
I am expecting from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact is quickly judged and to be fully understood .
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moves to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aim to prevent un@@ avoidable issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain did not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , because the leading organization who over@@ sees the European game has power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were called by the UEF@@ A Agency , mean that PS@@ G finally has to be re@@ funded that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed with no major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million Euros ( 262 million $ ) in order to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s proc@@ ession to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can do the money with certainty , so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ writes and bring him to a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team through the rich mi@@ scher@@ family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; one may use a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but need to counter legitimate sources of revenue , which allow them to allow the break @-@ E@@ ven point in their face to the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini based on his election as UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French players believed that they had taken huge debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ki@@ ed to ruin , if banks or owners moved their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P rel@@ ayed from concentration on the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch originally used 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then was a strong investment to build the crew and build a global brand - become a tough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P pre@@ disposition , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of € 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , the UEF@@ A successor to Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to shr@@ ink from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will still intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible for FF@@ P , towards The Associ@@ ated Press of the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat @-@ position , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing about the duration of its contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract so that the off@@ springs will be shown in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has brought the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a loss of 60 million euro ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the team member for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to super@@ list their financial supervision by putting their revenue by companies , who are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could exceed the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsorship would exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not apply this as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsorship of the P@@ SA was built by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 could occur in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar WC @-@ amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will be able to find out such a man@@ o@@ eu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the current sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEF@@ A is to be more attentive , every attempt to notice the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepared conversations with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , sag@@ ging on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they said under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
&quot; the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros , which has achieved more than 10 million euros . &quot;
the accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing for sponsorship @-@ De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and trig@@ gering sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly ir@@ ted to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s removal by eliminating that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the State , &quot; said the President of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish Daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s latter owner . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that has financed a society . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;

&quot; Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed upon request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report on the newspaper &quot; &quot; northwest @-@ speaking Switzerland &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the Air@@ line will launch a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white ch@@ og@@ lob@@ es are split up to 14 grams per year the crew holders before landing on the passengers .
the Swiss Life plans to do not have any information .
&quot; we value the contract volume in accordance with the North @-@ West Switzerland , from 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ subsidiary achiev@@ es an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is all@@ em@@ al of the adver@@ t effect : for a for@@ og@@ gi@@ ver it is a prestigious order .
&quot; like many Candi@@ dates in the new alert , the Swiss will not reveal . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come to question .
&quot; according to the newspaper &apos;s report , Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the contract over the spring of 2018 . &quot;
for the S@@ DA was the biggest Swiss Cho@@ col@@ ate manufacturer not accessible for an opinion .
chocolate @-@ boards spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before Swiss signed a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Call@@ eb@@ aut had delivered in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablet . &quot;
the opportunity to place the logo was Swiss back two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss Cho@@ col@@ ade@@ ers .
&quot; on long @-@ distance flights , customers of First Class are spoiled by Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class Na@@ schen passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi from Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

No@@ st@@ algie goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of the story is at the same time nost@@ alg@@ ically because of the gl@@ amor@@ ous days of characters of 80 @-@ years , for the 90 @-@ er @-@ years @-@ gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as the pres@@ ker @-@ com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV rot@@ ten ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is also a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as a fran@@ chise , it feels as if the time was close . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of its absur@@ di@@ ver ( it contained a original history for an attractive D@@ ose vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; playing at the core of the gig - actor middle age play spirit@@ ually children , who grow up - nevertheless they run the im@@ possibility to win the last part of the w@@ itz@@ es back . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotional rooted and its par@@ ody works more after the found@@ ational films of the 90 @-@ er years such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cr@@ adle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , which illustrate the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character sets out a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gr@@ acious co@@ op ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ read impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the Ex@@ c@@ ines are the best part of fran@@ chise .
&quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons of the &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could he@@ ed this fran@@ chise like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater &quot; , whose final scene will show the bonds by &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; at Amazon has now reminded of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its east @-@ against @-@ west ring competition . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy of Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director gives to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main tro@@ ll@@ ings - a hard ges@@ ted Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ ine Pier@@ sic , and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogs of chann@@ elling Tat@@ um ( also a comprehensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt to be syn@@ ced in English . &quot;
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice gifts to look ( the police spends the time to watch chess on TV , like Americans it might do with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a dou@@ bt@@ ful propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer which carries a Re@@ agan mas@@ ke , it is often considered a single one . &quot;
&quot; in six long episodes , it draws itself and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; who was re@@ arranged on a lower length , his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re could deliver better , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick males who dev@@ oti@@ des a bunch of Hamburg . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that the Western culture can make everything to the feed for a gel .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Black @-@ B@@ aar @-@ B@@ aar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ tw@@ rope , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart were crossed by numerous objects such as the prosec@@ ution and Con@@ stance on Friday . &quot;
15 alleg@@ ations were arrested in the age between 25 and 77 and already en@@ acted in arrest warran@@ t against them .
&quot; in addition , the officials placed larger quantities marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , bul@@ lets , as well as several hundreds of thousands of Euros . &quot;
in the same raid in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ t .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
on the action Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators were involved .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
&quot; the members of the m@@ af@@ ia will be organised drug crimin@@ ality , serious violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; for the summer 2016 , the prosec@@ ution of the Con@@ stance against organised drug @-@ commerce in the south @-@ German area . &quot;
&quot; between the prosec@@ ution in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ator of the crime ists had nearly daily contacts with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; in the Visi@@ ons of the studies , above all Italian nation@@ als with regard to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; even a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , were fired several shots in the morning in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account . &quot;
manner lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner Register
&quot; data of citizens , who should not emerge . &quot; a report according to the foreig@@ ner @-@ Register in Germany has considerable shortcomings . &quot;
the lead to partly gra@@ zing de@@ mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
&quot; the order for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen is , has made aware of a media report according to large gaps in the country @-@ country name . &quot;
&quot; defects in the data recorded there could result in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; to some serious mal@@ decisions , &quot; war@@ ned in an analysis that is the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the Register , the data is estimated according to ten million people with foreign citizenship , including approximately 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been well received . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dents have been found in 1921 , &quot; by people who are long ago no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer arise in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inser@@ tions can be slo@@ w@@ down significantly , &quot; it is called the report to further . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; statisti@@ c ) statistics relating to sufficient people are embr@@ ac@@ ing the EU citizens who would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; but such false preparations led to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with extinction , it is therefore in analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has clearly begun to re@@ send refugee families with 16 @-@ year children back to Italy if they were there . &quot;
&quot; this is emerging from an internal paper of the Federal Ministry for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re newspaper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper it is therefore , the BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; related to families with children - except for inf@@ ants and small children - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 the newspaper was practically no longer possible so the newspaper among reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to achieve them first . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rations reach another EU country , the state can send it back to the rede@@ em@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; for the reason , the Office write : &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with inf@@ eri@@ or children in Italy increased substantially . &quot;
Italy made up for the recording and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) hold these commitments for sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even other EU states would send refugees back to Dublin as part of the Dublin agreement . &quot;
&quot; the inter @-@ political speaker of the left @-@ group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ hen up because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of un@@ law@@ ful absorption , and a threat to life . &quot;
second result achieved

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0,25 %
the Bank of England will likely be announced that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation took over a rise .
the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish@@ ly &quot; when they keep interest rates on family members in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure .
&quot; the policy decision of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 , to keep interest rates on 0.25 % , with fewer members a rise in this month because weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support of an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 on 1.7 % and by 2018 in 1,6 % , whereby inflation in the autumn is likely to rise to almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but it also sign@@ alized that in the next few years Zin@@ ovi@@ position would be necessary to breed the inflation , and she said that the credit cost would possibly increase more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw a portion of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s economic package , which was issued prior to a year after Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for finance plan to provide more cheap financial resources for banks from next February , although it is expected to be 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds of Ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on interest rate the Bank says : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since pressure on the real income of households will continue to use the consumption . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates of interest , they repeated that &quot; a certain fir@@ ming of monetary policy &quot; would be required for cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly greater &quot; scale than the markets await . &quot;
the markets forecast for the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected compared with the 1.9 % and 1.7 % .
it has maintained its growth forecasts on 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound fell after this news towards the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell at 0.5 % to the + US dollar and fell by 0.3 % to the sea .
&quot; however , the decision to no change comes after the recent pro@@ ving growth increases the rising expectations on a productivity level and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.3 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth will be expected in the third quarter at 0.3 % , although it will be easily rec@@ u@@ perate after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent in@@ flow report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by an increasing inflation and low wages , as the tigh@@ tening is first even worse before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy should not happen in the coming years &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be able to recover significantly to the end of its three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pounds , resulting in a part of lower consumption levels . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes from a year after lowering interest rates on 0.25 % last August after the sho@@ cking EU @-@ vote , which was caused by the sink of the car . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the last judgment of the Bank to interest rates , the call was increased after an increased risk since inflation was reduced to harsh households , with three political decision makers in July an increase of 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation was dropped last month from 2.9 % in June to 2.9 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and it will be again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the crossing in relation to its goal of 2 % would be &quot; entirely &quot; to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ ad Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the recent back@@ process of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks especially good for those , where existing de@@ cks are running and the new mort@@ g@@ ages will complete , and many with toll free options and low cr@@ ates are becoming popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( the national health service ) is supposed to write an controversial HIV @-@ drug , 10,000 people &quot;
patients will receive access to an &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment starting from September to a fight against the medication in N@@ HS access .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one prior to sexual intercourse ac@@ o@@ prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the inf@@ usion risk in high @-@ risk data by around 86 percent , now delivered by healthcare service for an initial three @-@ annual study for more than 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process , after the Court of Justice had confirmed the jud@@ gement of the Supreme Court of Justice in the last year that the N@@ HS had authority to pay for pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the chess magazine announced on Thursday by N@@ HS England @-@ Chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) called this as a decisive moment . &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first belong to the registration of people and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced to the UK in April 2018 . &quot;
Pre@@ lax@@ o@@ prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV supplements that may be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces HIV @-@ transmission of infectious agents .
pre@@ p before intercourse means to take that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before the intercourse .
&quot; those who come for treatment in question include pregnant or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners that have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants will identify which the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a medical practitioner can also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will present £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the medication within this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to judge the full potential of pre@@ p by integrating clinical trials , as it is used in a large scale , and is implemented and implemented . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for prevention of HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humankind . &quot;
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if it is targeted at vulnerable and endangered people , the possibility of changing the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk , people will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt at this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not linked with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority is now to be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test was coated , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected persons . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcomed after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ative implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence show how trans@@ forms this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and may end the transfer of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect persons who are infected with HIV , and that it is contributing to the ending of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
the great life live : mezzanine and cl@@ ever@@ e designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court dwelling in a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and has sold .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger area , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I sear@@ ched for something , that was the price of my price . &quot;
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and it was the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square @-@ feet large apartment has been completely out@@ dated . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room estate with a scr@@ aper layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to best use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she instruc@@ ted the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over@@ one another , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to consider cancer to release the pre@@ disposition .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were re@@ mixed up , without having to ban ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not just a question of building a simple platform , but to set up the steel so that he had the right height at the top or below . &quot;
&quot; this kind of order enabled Er@@ fan , to place two rooms in full of one another - with a lot of extra drama . &quot;
for the mezzanine a classic coupl@@ ing window by Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ am@@ our@@ y living area down .
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver , and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lights put the style for the program . &quot;
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
in both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to take him longer .
the kitchen feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all the h@@ edge and glasses of jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ ing space , the beauty of the living room can conclude the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a wardrobe .
&quot; a bit of &quot; &quot; engineering &quot; &quot; went in , &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the st@@ ahl@@ enburg , fur@@ ni@@ zed M@@ DF door . &quot;
&quot; it is now important , so when you move the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 sqm , an extra bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter , and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time use high quality materials , giving the room to its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical socket in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
&quot; it shows that an apartment can transform itself into something very astonishing , due to good design and increased square footage . &quot;
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollar property
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian Family founded the Dyn@@ asty , in a confrontation because of one of the largest property imperative of Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors of his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business should be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family run for 2014 , but a sharp confrontation on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers sold 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , and since 1973 family has bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there he founded the family of West@@ co Je@@ ans , and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . m@@ esh as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Col@@ in - by Paul as a &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the enterprise &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a jurisdiction states that Col@@ in has property worth $ 316 million and has a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be problematic for Paul as problem .
&quot; the ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents proposed by Col@@ in proposed are left behind him that I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed hospitals took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , which I have excluded . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in argu@@ ed that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul against , some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent to manage . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to conc@@ eive the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost is in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading attor@@ neys , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and by both sides . &quot;
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her husband &apos;s husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in Col@@ in to the first je@@ ans@@ loading of the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co , when he was in high school in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hopes to pass her own property to her sons in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid for 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Luke as also Mark be , Paul says to be bit@@ tered about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept back very well although he was a former AF@@ L office member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys contact .
&quot; only col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; I really cannot say much &quot; , &quot; because the case before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to complain and draw our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not have wondered that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and she added that he still hopes for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s of new staff is planning to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly is actually doing it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reported that the new staff head of the White House is planning to limit the information flow on President Tru@@ mp , including the reports of the news media - hoping to hold the head on an equal course . &quot;
here is a piece of Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new staff of the White House , he met his first work@@ day with senior staff , he represented a main problem with President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he wants to repair : bad information that get into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ aming the Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when promising Tru@@ mp was angry due to unfair reporting was it productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former elec@@ toral advis@@ er Sam Nun@@ berg in February with Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep the Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former elec@@ toral election officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ er praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit is ever &quot; &quot; under control &quot; , &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps this campaign was something we could not know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s t@@ ets could not have been included without their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets which the Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; if his staff managed to maintain it several times , trouble from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has consistently able to prevent the tru@@ mp contro@@ versy .
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a White House , which sets out from competing parties always try to present their own agenda by bringing the Tru@@ mp material that may possibly improve their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - entirely with this story - reported in May on the preference of the consultant , to bring the President for strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example that was described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher .
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp @-@ officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano on negative press information , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks and that it turns out to find out from where they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone gave the President mal@@ icious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the source behind a bunch of le@@ ks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson passed because of sil@@ ks permanently from Twitter , or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he vo@@ iced the wrong accus@@ ations in the past and vo@@ ke them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then St@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to prove the most effective manager as a Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ si@@ ves Self , and his consultant still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ ges@@ ic crimin@@ als get post from Euro@@ pol
because the address is unknown , the co @-@ operation of the people will pray and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police in all Europe will be ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards on dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; as the addresses of the affected sword bur@@ gl@@ ars are not known according to the general terms , information from the population are hop@@ ed and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; calendar of winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many of the wings are hiding place , it was called by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
a 21 post@@ cards have put together 21 post@@ cards from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;

travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return back to &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are once again confronted with some strong travellers on war , who have negotiated one of the municipality drawn from the municipality in order to return an array in front of its rulers . &quot;
&quot; the travelers have called their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosp@@ erous road from Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; &quot; million@@ aires &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transport , after they were k@@ ick@@ ed down in May , without being de@@ ported from any of the Council to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the beat @-@ full group found a gap in the defense units and de@@ pressing their vehicles by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is &quot; useless be to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They were moved on the assembly , after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath , where they were throwing stones at the ped@@ estr@@ ains . &quot;
&quot; the Council has to be comp@@ elled by ver@@ tically for implementation , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably still more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it , by keeping long instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my common church if the Council cannot stop it once .
&quot; a living , who did not want to be called , said , &quot; It is ridicul@@ ous , we just saw the last lap of these travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
this time the numbers have increased and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as to move them as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our evidence collection , it is very important that many citizens get an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must review , when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ l is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the former ambience operating gesellschaft mbH to the 13th of April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights will be lost per year and also received revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in the face of the figures concerning the numbers of refugees who arrived in the county , the hotel building is offered as an umbrella accommodation , what happened to the contro@@ versy . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the council .
&quot; but most importantly , Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ l Ober@@ may@@ meister Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time by serious prosp@@ ective buyers in the house . &quot;
he was right to retain .
the group of Lu@@ en@@ enh@@ otels with head@@ head Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ estr@@ els and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are happy Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof are available for a longer time in front of the entrance , and when one enters the house , it becomes clear , what extensive renovation work will be made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were found out , blankets are partly built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single site .
to March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the black @-@ style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large cov@@ able showers , the entrance area is designed , the new window will be installed . &quot;
&quot; everything was later &quot; &quot; beautiful brus@@ g@@ ern@@ ah &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressed . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece , &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are one of the facilities . &quot;
&quot; if one wants to position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , stressed Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is set wide up with its approximately 60 rooms , explained Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual visitors , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel at ease at their hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , he already led , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the ideas of the city are equal to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investment in demand , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to set the right place . &quot;
&quot; barely under a million euros , it counts . &quot;
&quot; even the outside positions are brought to front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is publicly available from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : U.S. Special Jury consists of
&quot; in the Russia @-@ President Donald Tru@@ mp , the U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is supposed to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report . &quot;
&quot; the panel has recorded the job in recent weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote on appeal to the issue of trusted persons . &quot;
the newspaper value the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has extended its investigation and intensified .
the CN@@ N channels reported it already enter the first pre @-@ inv@@ itations of the body related to a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies en@@ forced the Krem@@ lin for a longer time to deal with a vote in the presidential elections in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller is studying whether they were talking between Tru@@ mp@@ s elec@@ toral team and Moscow .
&quot; the focus of the investigation should be several men , which acted in the election campaign as a consultant of Republi@@ cans . &quot;
&quot; according to this report , Mu@@ eller took a more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment among the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special tru@@ er Tru@@ mp has moved out personally to the center , and seek the accus@@ ation whether the President in the wake of the affair may be hin@@ dered the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and determine this evidence in possible failure , and decide whether the indic@@ t@@ ment should be raised . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called charges .
&quot; mostly , they are switched on when it is about larger and contro@@ versy . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in order to download people for re@@ movable under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N channels , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been exhibited , revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp j@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
individuals who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement called it was in the report .
&quot; moreover , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tru@@ mp j@@ r also Tru@@ mp@@ s became consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam chief manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during conversation .
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday night in the US TV , that the release will show that Mu@@ eller shall not be in@@ timi@@ date in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it will not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched to the end in order to decide on the collection of an accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the creation of the body at the beginning of a new phase in investigations , and a new reason for President Tru@@ mp &apos;s concern . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the new revelations , the president on Thursday night will be a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the issue gives the Democrats a possibility to feel good , because they have nothing but they can talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion , he didn &apos;t know anything about the introduction of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; however , these work also usually in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House fears all measures that accelerated the work of special intermedi@@ aries in a fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI @-@ Chef James Com@@ ey said three times that will not be elected against the president .
&quot; one has no reason to accept that something has changed , it was on the explanation . &quot;
Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been fired .
&quot; because of this R@@ aus@@ ages , alleg@@ ations against Tru@@ mp was loud , he did not want to hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a broad@@ board , Tru@@ mp was asked to ask him about a post@@ pon@@ ement of the investigation of the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is due to the investigation under great pressure .
&quot; after portr@@ ay@@ al of US media , the White House gathered the White House to the Sonder@@ er@@ investig@@ ators and his associates . &quot;
the extingu@@ ishing spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to release .
&quot; other than an independent special investigation of the Congress , such as at the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , after the later president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theoretically could be strengthened on ur@@ ging of the President of the Minister of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent this in a single step .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators put on Thursday on Thursday , after which the special investig@@ ators can no longer be released so easy . &quot;
Antarc@@ tic : gigantic ic@@ eberg continues in the Antarc@@ tic
&quot; in the western Antarc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg was solved by the scar@@ c@@ ater size Berlin@@ s of the Schel@@ hor@@ s . &quot;
the shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for polar@@ isation and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; over a Bil@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , big colon@@ os@@ sus trei@@ ch is now to the north and will probably take two , three years until he was mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; it is equipped with 175 kilometers in length and width of up to 50 kilometres , one of the biggest ic@@ gi@@ ants who have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
a danger to man does not go from him .
&quot; however , climate change has played a role in the collapse of the ice age , is unclear according to researchers . &quot;
&quot; in total , there have been a series of un@@ common inter@@ rup@@ tions of Eis@@ sch@@ el@@ fen in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be combined with a warm @-@ up heating . &quot;
the flo@@ wed pist@@ on was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s .
Schel@@ che@@ &apos;s flo@@ cks on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it is growing constantly growing in the sea and breaks off on a regular basis .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s is in the south of South America nearly at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
the north of this Schel@@ del@@ ity was the balance of growth and ab@@ om@@ iting a few years ago .
&quot; a complete Schel@@ e@@ day is there , and writes AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; I speak some of it that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s is in danger , for the cau@@ tious channel has never gone back as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the ic@@ e@@ plate stand under tension and can be cr@@ ush , if in a key@@ point a piece was bre@@ aded . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ hor@@ s and Eis@@ berg will not increase the sea level , as they float up on the water and ice cream as much water as it gives after the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the Schel@@ en@@ circle leads to the gl@@ aci@@ ers straight into the sea , and much faster can flow than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level , but only in the lesser extent , writes the British research project to observe the Antarc@@ tic ( MI@@ DAS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s is based on AW@@ I @-@ information with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth largest and the Antarc@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge of the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks on a regular basis .
&quot; although it is a natural thing and not a direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ eberg is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y said of the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most advanced withdrawal since the start of records , &quot; confirmed he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists would be disp@@ uted whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s will now grow again or in the long term , and possibly merge his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if this researchers fail to withdraw the break of this gigantic ic@@ eberg that fall back on climate change , but in recent decades , there are very many ice sk@@ ies of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula . &quot;
&quot; this long goat of the Antarc@@ tic , stretches in the direction of South America . &quot;
&quot; according to the data of the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the ice area of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has gone to 28 000 square kilometres since the 19@@ 50s . &quot;
the decline has contributed to the decline .
&quot; the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has gone by about three degrees warmer during the past 50 years , and thus the temperature in which the temperature of the fastest growing . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to use Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy free places , the CD@@ U calls for the CD@@ U to get out of the Employ@@ ee association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the Krei@@ day started 41 new places in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 exhibited and officials work for Krei@@ ett@@ mann in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 appr@@ enti@@ ces have their first work@@ day behind him . &quot;
the teaching at the circle are obviously very popular .
there were some 620 applications for which this year were to be reported in vain places .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to be able to cope with the increasing requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a group in M@@ ett@@ mann in the district of 50 not occupied sites . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers are looking for general management as well as the forces of general management . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative jointly with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG TECH take the initiative and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
the management should develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development after the wish of the parties . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term needs in skilled workers , but forward @-@ looking forward the application cr@@ un@@ ness is called it . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a training , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
it sounds like this already after a good approach .
&quot; because the circle has to do with personal problems , one did not know in the past . &quot;
other cities advertise good official and en@@ visi@@ oned and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is of a regul@@ ating &quot; competition of the public employer . &quot;
&quot; there is a high number of employees , the disease or alter@@ ation caused by the ministry . &quot;
&quot; so the highest time to action , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter races , Fr@@ ac@@ ef of the CD@@ U , will go beyond the common motion by his party . &quot;
he did so long ago in the chal@@ et for a lazy surprise as he publicly asked the personnel and the remaining parties were ast@@ o@@ unding .
&quot; peoples would like to be verified , that all possibilities will be verified , which enable an out@@ let of the municipal worker @-@ association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come briefly to an satisfying solution here , the roundabout , with the unions - perhaps also seek out in cooperation with the county of the county - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; this means the CD@@ U , the employees and officials attempt to pay better than it is the fee for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , enh@@ ancements or more money there is only when you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute Protection Act . &quot;
&quot; not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy intensified the sound of NGO @-@ migrants @-@ lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has tried NGOs to war@@ n the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they are not allowed to continue , if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new Code of Con@@ duct , it is difficult to see how to continue working , &quot; &quot; Interior Marco Minn@@ iti was in an interview with the Tur@@ ine Daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ro &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth ret@@ ch@@ ings , because their team had effectively worked with an@@ thro@@ es in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organization that has only been in operation since one year , to express themselves to detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we &apos;re sorry to operate at the moment in the search and b@@ ail@@ out zone , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can all pay the accus@@ ations that are currently raised , only after we have collected all the information and to judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had super@@ vised the boat of &apos; youth ret@@ ains &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his crew tac@@ kl@@ ed tu@@ din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which will be delivered to them directly by human chains , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gler can be used again so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting found supposedly only 1,3 miles prior to the Libyan coastline , according to the acquisition of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents of Italian media has been published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspic@@ ious , over the authority of Italian coastal guard , the lif@@ eb@@ rows in the zone made of humanitarian grounds and not by any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta need to have an Italian police officers on board that monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations , have so far been declared to hold the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable because they were no &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; to their b@@ ail@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organisation doctors without borders ( M@@ SF ) is concerned . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti is meanwhile argu@@ ed that the number of migrants that came back to the rescue measures in Italy , in recent weeks , that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan territorial Guard and have borne the cooperation with the local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives , and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that can leave these countries in hope , Europe . &quot;
cradle and tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berliner out@@ post &quot; and two guest @-@ drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Northern alz region , in order to enjoy four days long tri@@ als and attractions . &quot;
there were three audi@@ tioned guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga en@@ ge@@ ars for e@@ Sport
are the sport @-@ stars in future be sitting in front of computer sol@@ ves instead of fighting with wind and weather over the stadium ?
&quot; the fact is : e @-@ sport has long since became a serious industry , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business has become a big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high coll@@ ages . &quot;
these have also recognized the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ a who are increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; in the beginning , 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which was founded in the middle of July an E @-@ Sport @-@ section and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire the whole new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; that there are still a few changes on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend the World Cup of FIFA hosted the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; at which the gam@@ er of different clubs can compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now an agency for virtual foot@@ ball@@ ers .
&quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 year @-@ old , that young people continue to go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs stri@@ ves to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , too . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ sport athletes , one could be more often more often present on these markets than once in the year to send the Federal lig@@ aments to Asia once a year . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; with e @-@ sport computer games such as &quot; &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or just the Football @-@ Simulation FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; of course , as in normal sports , Li@@ gen is established , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian countries , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about a correct sport ?
for many is the performance of the most ordinary .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bery has long been faced with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because he is com@@ edy and many biological and physical reactions show that one can find also in classic sports - for example raised heart rate , stra@@ ins , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there is cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction capacity . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only be on the console but also exercise their body and watch on the diet .
the f@@ itte player is a good player .
&quot; F@@ rob@@ bery also sees problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more an issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult at online gaming , and in the scene l@@ acked the structures of classic sport . &quot;
the scientists highlights the high inclusive impact of the e @-@ sport .
&quot; the players are international on the way , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural inhi@@ bitions . &quot;
a study conducted by the Management Consult@@ ancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ feder@@ ate Interactive software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , in Germany , 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments . &quot;
in three years the turnover of 130 million is expected .
against the nearly 2.1 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga is minimal .
&quot; however , be the e @-@ sport &quot; not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball , or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the USA where Ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez at the US team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe is doing a lot .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport as a teaching has been introduced , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Ver@@ oni@@ um Dut@@ t has now been oblig@@ ated to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany behind &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old times to be clari@@ fied , today is no longer sufficient . &quot;
it is a matter of keeping the tradition of the charity but to al@@ ign the company at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; you cannot bear in mind that only when football remains everything , as it always was . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the texts , the Con@@ rad Roy for su@@ ic@@ ide , condem@@ ns &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend to su@@ ic@@ ide by lyrics and calls for su@@ ic@@ ide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars , and five years were exposed to mal@@ nutrition . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned in June because of the crus@@ hing killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on July 13 , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ trendy . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free up to appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their justi@@ fiable argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , Carter beat with tears in the eyes , Carter as with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down judicial eyes , when it was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the Court . &quot;
she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ rier &apos;s lawyer said , there was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance , which they are completely depl@@ eted . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their cl@@ ergy , have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor &apos;s read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the said that there is &quot; no day , in which I don &apos;t smoke the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want that he is proud of me and as I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters there is to be there . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys S@@ ister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never be able to participate in the marriage of her brother or a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have with which I was together for my birth each day , is a pain that I will keep in mind for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to commit to commit to su@@ ic@@ ide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon dioxide in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters texts , revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging yourself on , spr@@ ing@@ from a building , ste@@ ered yourself , I do not know there are many paths , &quot; she said in several news that she sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot;
&quot; standing in front of his su@@ ic@@ ide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; everything you need to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sear@@ ched by the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that they will benefit by any press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; in the few , the Carter defended , belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , which was condemned to 2007 because of the murder of her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before it was released two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times form a comment : &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua allowed me to run at Audi Cup as captain &apos;s building is not acci@@ dental .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut to the Con@@ fed Cup winner has a big season to - Extra motivation .
&quot; something else was different on his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ my immediately , even if the additional clothing piece was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide at the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , there was not a Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er , he made himself a shared bond with his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as a Bavaria captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the one could have been better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of coach could also suggest .
&quot; not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was taken out of youth , de@@ co@@ zin@@ ants and especially from the holiday dedicated professionals of the existing C @-@ El@@ f as the leaders . &quot;
&quot; sugar@@ s , you have been distributed to those who want to hold much , which you want to keep in La@@ une . &quot;
&quot; so who was chosen to enter the legacy of Lah@@ m , can use a small extra @-@ motivation . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed , &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player to take over responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday flat of the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as Mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
&quot; right back , this is its position , the white bond in the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ me in this start formation like the one who can take the Ru@@ der also best into his hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to channel the un@@ played tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had the view of the whole while many others were employed with himself .
&quot; Vid@@ al with thus , his lack of fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ ly barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches to tie out to the performance of the Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ dable only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le therefore , not neg@@ atively affected in their first appearance in Bavaria . &quot;
it all seemed quite good .
&quot; South Korea went beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both besi@@ eged sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli @-@ storm often did heavy , and also tried to be successful in the playing construction a few times . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy gave the fact that the result was not as we expected .
but also he showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; shift , Tem@@ po@@ change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to this Bavaria world still for the new@@ bies , you saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example existed in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me pushed for a few kn@@ itted statements in his back to his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; what goes here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you simply have to win each game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new ones . &quot;

company satisfied with the rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ alz Minister : economy lo@@ wers Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it often proved irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ably , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , and the Minister of the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate was . &quot;
&quot; this is after more than one year , where the new Economy of Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policies - and bl@@ asting the old minister at the same time .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ er companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Know attacks the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt has blocked . &quot;
the largest turn@@ around provides Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the link between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is in the pri@@ ori@@ es@@ list of the country so far .
&quot; this year , the ministry is hoping for a planning process until 2021 is supposed to stand . &quot;
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ h@@ ung Tri@@ er that stands in the pre @-@ urgent need for the Federal Aviation Station .
&quot; aim is to take the route in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees this as a sign for regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er stri@@ ves , as seen from Wis@@ sing , in the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate @-@ label to boost the sales volumes in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to start their own business , lo@@ ells the Chamber of Industry . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Tri@@ er looks at the new master @-@ bonus an additional incentive for young students , says Managing Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the premi@@ ums of 1,000 Euro is provided for the best@@ and@@ ene Master Test and 2500 Euro , when gradu@@ ates within ten years after the master@@ ing is self @-@ employed . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; with the planned road @-@ building , quickly facts are to create , at the same time , it faul@@ ted the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Head of the Chamber of Industry Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; 56 new engineers , who want to adjust the wi@@ sing in the provincial mobility , have so far been occupied by 29 places . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ ac@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to calculations of the invo@@ ices , the country inv@@ ests investments in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros in the conservation of national roads . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of country as it wants to resolve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
in addition to the previous broad@@ band l@@ ew@@ at@@ ering in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the supply of networks in a I@@ HK survey . &quot;
they complain about sc@@ aling Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ economic Ministry of E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Super@@ visory Board of Wind@@ mill Pro Wind .

Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chair said , the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; there are intelligent options as driver constraints , &quot; and then moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to offer or to limit . &quot;
Daim@@ ler was announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes cars to be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the company as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen Ox@@ ides , the diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ obil@@ es , systems for neutr@@ alization of the vehicles of diesel vehicles cho@@ p to install , also take what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also being indic@@ ted to ignore the powerful automobile companies and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen to regulate the use of so @-@ called ab@@ out@@ age devices to regulate the provisions if a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several were charged by Volkswagen , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in Germany by Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , Itali@@ ans is Italian and therefore is not protected from delivery and could be put to justice in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year Audi was included in German criminal investigation by Volkswagen , following the authorities to have installed a system to cope with the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be hard for Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the benefit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the most @-@ published carto@@ ons of Car@@ to@@ on @-@ Zeich@@ ner , the p@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his figures are its hall@@ mark . &quot;
also with 85 distingu@@ ishes the Argent@@ inian still and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he made himself a sign of bl@@ iss@@ ant cards among others - what he frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris match &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo many fans found .
again and again the artist of cities inspire him .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures bo@@ ar@@ der in drawings with the sh@@ ale tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he has his own information , according to the character , which works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , pupp@@ ets and watches find his dro@@ ll figures continues to find a lot of spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years he has been working on a cartoon , and a TV series with his figures . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a Giraffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any score in his drawings - , which has a thous@@ and@@ ss@@ ler as a counter@@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie which is to come to the Kin@@ ol@@ ein@@ wand . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it is wei@@ rd to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore he is more foc@@ ussed on the TV series , which is produced , like its original design@@ ations . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is due to the con@@ stric@@ ted conditions and due to the disease transfer insects , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence was effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which in spring has brought much less rain and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the life span of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small cir@@ c@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that over@@ carries d@@ warf , and with very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and it is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil lo@@ wers not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very qu@@ eri@@ ed for perf@@ ume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse : &quot; instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TE@@ REN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or damaged . &quot;
so we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered to be considered , a better water distribution and the slo@@ wing of the ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the prot@@ ru@@ ding of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the Weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce normally meet with tw@@ o@@ chs to check their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and c@@ eas@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
&quot; it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is more secure : you should take their children with the office , who were the aim of an attack with pom@@ p , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words on a panel on the front of space : opponents , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; you would like to propose the re@@ por@@ ter , names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdom@@ inal . &quot;
&quot; there are drug jewellery , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists who are suspic@@ i@@ ent to stand upon the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no quiet period of violence , and while in all the land the cor@@ p@@ ses are awaiting the cor@@ p@@ ses , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to took place in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are standing after attack and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths among seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her publisher and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest error is to live in Mexico and being a journalist , Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his lack is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its mid@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , &quot; hanging at the fa@@ ç@@ ade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , which show his su@@ pre@@ y face with spectac@@ les or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss about their shared subjects , trau@@ ma , its night@@ mare , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 a Son@@ der @-@ Bundes@@ utor &apos;s office was established to edit the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with the most thousands of Mor@@ den , which are connected each year with drug @-@ trade and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; on Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still insist on the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ com@@ for@@ ting and although the terrain is still tra@@ it@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting of the discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to w@@ asting my time in this workshop , says he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , mi@@ str@@ ust we all . &quot;
in the morning of the 15th of May Val@@ dez took the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; he managed just to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was forced out of his car , and 12 time was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; &quot; T@@ wel@@ ten river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the fl@@ eman was driving away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to be freely accessible in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but in the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but welding .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ arrested last year and the deport@@ ation of the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t Batt@@ lefield in the country , since ri@@ val@@ ising political groups are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of cultivated , two @-@ stor@@ ey Maus@@ ole@@ ans for drug reg@@ ains that are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a map control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings had contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the release of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , suspected fans bought every specimen of the output once they were delivered to time @-@ ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was not to force in Val@@ dez , after conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had been the same story to leave the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing will be seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
&quot; he had survived , that his friends and colleagues had survived , that he would always be there . &quot;
in 2003 he was working as an experienced re@@ por@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ do@@ er than he worked together with five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism , without encounter the pre@@ d@@ ote problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time , the newspaper also served a reputation because of cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and the sales and promotion of advertising . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ters loved it , tough apt studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and readers have been fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else to treat . &quot;
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he gave himself up voluntarily to that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living &quot; , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug handel in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you need to take the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many still@@ ness ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team did miss Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak bird , who was like a port workers , the friend , who knew generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
you trust in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and there always sit at the same table . &quot;
now ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
&quot; his death also has forced them to ask her own assu@@ mptions in question , how they do their work best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like you when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their o@@ il@@ able starting @-@ and cross @-@ debate &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ management . &quot;
his own inst@@ in@@ ers trust .
if it smells wrong , keep away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger , &quot; said the editor of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be crus@@ hed ... and then the thing with J@@ avier has happened . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , such as he and others are considered in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas , VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt governance . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room , in which the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security , suddenly there were no hand@@ ys allowed . days previously announced that Spy@@ ware was sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside two polic@@ emen examined standing in front of the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers , who referred to the governor itself as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs de facto under control . &quot;
for the edition of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has taken on three main hist@@ ories .
there was the murder of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exc@@ pos@@ é on the state spending that focused on the hom@@ etown of the Gover@@ nor .
&quot; and there was a group that conducted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the At@@ tor@@ ney , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug retailers and administr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ por@@ ter took from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader , who has been consul@@ ted by the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) which domin@@ ates nearly all political planes the whole century . &quot;
several Pr@@ i @-@ Govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ per cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the re@@ por@@ ters , about previous inci@@ dents in this eat@@ ery , including one , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man had a military attack . &quot;
only a few months before the readers had seen the Kolum@@ ba of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; previously we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to storage space for characters and sti@@ ckers , which are opposed to the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
por@@ ter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez took a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration because of another journalists to the Office of the Prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared after three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was detected and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country journalists have become more lu@@ cid , by having written down in organized protests of &quot; &quot; SOS Press &quot; &quot; on walking paths and construction . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is underway in Washington and tries to raise international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez accused R@@ ami@@ rez who sp@@ ying journalists and let them return because they said the truth .
&quot; she has since then asked that she is once again divided by the government , because it is concerned that their anger has been wo@@ unded their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico organized by organised crime , by participating government officials and a &quot; valid society &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that journalists are not only killed by drug members , but also by politicians and security guards , with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; took more than half of the attacks on journalists from police and officials last year .
&quot; in Mexico @-@ minded , because they would like that you dis@@ proportionate the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern bor@@ dering state of Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Z@@ etas bund@@ ell , &quot; I am here because of my reports . &quot;
a computer scanner and ear@@ phones are in addition to their separate head .
some stores have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern bor@@ derland Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly set up the drug cart@@ els with a editorial article on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ?
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find jobs in exile and they still watch the streets and search for dangers .
&quot; and sometimes they will be ch@@ ased , as it was apparently murdered by the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was in charge of four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ related decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who was once po@@ ets , gives to that the drug @-@ trading makes him frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that is why I was re@@ por@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already ended , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on the side@@ walk before the office and tran@@ ken beer , as at once all their phones started . &quot;
&quot; a series of sc@@ op@@ ies with band@@ en@@ riv@@ ets and security guards near the bath@@ or@@ tes Maz@@ at@@ lan had written 19 confirmed .
the war escal@@ ates how it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell Em@@ bassies in the region .
from the on @-@ side effects they published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the cover page had to be changed on the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ els close to - another shot in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen which stopped to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid of fear , they showed it not . &quot;
&quot; among the vast portrait of the unusual green of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; how you can also think about close , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day was murdered by the J@@ avier who asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to do@@ dge its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue if a terri@@ fying thing .
&quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible nose horn of a Canadian mining workers have been so well received , that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that they could even notice that his love was pure skin of red@@ dish brown , and they said they could have had something of an &quot; &quot; un@@ tranquil past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Chem@@ istry &quot; referred to as &quot; the bes@@ to@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered kind of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the roundabout between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; its incredibly well preserved condition has researchers , who describe it as &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ fres@@ ser is the best preserved F@@ ossi@@ l of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on 21 March 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed from the surrounding cliffs of the place , and decided to look more precise . &quot;
that was discovered by him F@@ ossi@@ l was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to exp@@ ose the wild animal within the 2.@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy ground@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just blin@@ ked a little with the eyes you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best survi@@ ving din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant ni@@ vor@@ es , although he is covered with an arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing shell , probably of meat @-@ looking din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly tor@@ tuous din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age , in order to hide from rob@@ bery and used a shi@@ el@@ ding technology that is used as a counter@@ circum@@ c@@ ture , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to rule his enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made the first head@@ lines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have studied the wild animal and studied there Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ er on the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of the team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing preservation of the specimen , Dr. Mitchell , and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of scales and ar@@ mo@@ urs about his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the con@@ sh@@ ady , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ aded is usual , the results are surprising , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far exce@@ eding the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs has enough pressure by meat e@@ ject din@@ osau@@ rs has been h@@ unted that evolution fav@@ ours the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the conv@@ ul@@ ing - think of roe deer , z@@ eb@@ ras or mar@@ riages - are much smaller and vulnerable as boot@@ y , which sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong smoking @-@ behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs rou@@ gh@@ ers must have been the roundabout , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows also that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was brown .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on references about his life , including his con@@ served gut , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , driven into a river and went out into the sea where he sun@@ k on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta were now as warm as south flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely far more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ated skin , but it remains in three dimensions and ret@@ ains the original form of animal , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early roundabout .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to use it to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
&quot; the circum@@ ference was a time , as a huge Ther@@ opo@@ da , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous cl@@ amp , who were on two legs , the earth had passed . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ unted by some of his fur@@ tive ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was buried in the sea after death in the sea and in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he found in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the best @-@ adjusted din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the thig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have wei@@ gh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inches long l@@ aces that rag@@ ed by his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ fres@@ her was curved by the western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river it was floo@@ ded into open sea . &quot;
but the underwater reef of the re@@ dal@@ e. keep his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
&quot; the rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well received , that the door@@ ke@@ este still get hol@@ pri@@ ge tank bs along the re@@ dal@@ e. &quot;
&quot; how Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , is such a level of preservation so &apos; rarely as a profit in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I get it , the more conf@@ render it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank plates , which carry the sk@@ ull of the beast . &quot;
&quot; his right front @-@ foot is on his side , his five fingers is split up upwards . &quot;
I can count the sheds on his sole .
in the ra@@ inst@@ or@@ m : mass @-@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wo@@ unded
fier@@ ce accident on Thursday night at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass @-@ bol@@ dt .
&quot; there are numerous surv@@ ey@@ ed , long distances - and g@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) were wo@@ unded at the late Thursday morning with a mass @-@ bol@@ dt for about 20 people .
after the first information of the police were at 5 p.m. between the Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ storm less than 30 cars , among them probably also trucks . &quot;
&quot; above the exact number of the last , there were no information available . &quot;
it is about light to moderate severe injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a big bu@@ ed to b@@ ail@@ ers was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was fully locked in direction Munich .
there was a long way to drive in Con@@ fer@@ til@@ ation in Munich for some ten kilometres .
&quot; as an AZ @-@ Repor@@ ter reported , it also came on the counter @-@ car to massive disabilities - through numerous g@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade not@@ ated the marks of the vehicles , which is now to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , the second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
thereby it was a coll@@ ision between a car ran@@ sport and a truck .
a rescue @-@ helic@@ opter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody has experienced before : nothing more sitting on the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ hi@@ ft or pull the driving force in the middle of the work@@ flow .
thr@@ ust control .
but times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon gone .
the German Rail is currently setting up your ticket control .
you simply confirm their place by phone that you have taken place and de@@ valued them the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; when the offer is made , we reach it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available next year on many more remote routes in Germany , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is called the train card de@@ valuation with no guards . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to booked an online ticket - which is already the most passengers .
&quot; it also has to be purchased via the app &apos;s app , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the easiest type of ticket . &quot;
and finally you need a seating reservation .
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works as follows : one climb@@ s in the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My tickets &quot; . &quot;
&quot; in case of the test customers , a button on the electronic de@@ valuation is published . &quot;
the traction lad@@ der get on their mobile devices report a message that chassis X is located on the train and has taken the seat Y Y seat Y .
comes the traction companion in your ticket control to place Y white he knows that there is a passenger with already un@@ aware online ticket .
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to be silent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who relaxed without a ticket to travel through our train@@ ee staff , ar@@ ouses in the DB navig@@ ator just yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the most passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing @-@ Board of DB remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives railway goes , knows that next to delays and missed the ticket controls to be the largest hass@@ le @-@ pil@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; for often , one does not have any documents in any case but one of the co @-@ rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement of all documents that you need to de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either lack the credit card or the ID card , or otherwise a document you have to indicate . &quot;
&quot; the consequence are endless discussions between train guides and driving , which leads to poor atmosphere in the storage or large @-@ room and delays in controlling your own tickets and taking the Con@@ duc@@ er at the end of the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
yet only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is just on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further traction numbers on the same track are not yet activated .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to her core .
&quot; only one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ al on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just gone a 18 @-@ year child , and there is still on the street , &quot; was it called there . &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one otherwise posted on her Fe@@ ed the information she closed on Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly praying on her Tim@@ eline .
&quot; the rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year @-@ old which was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live to twe@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he posted a picture of Bro@@ wns alive , which was spread on the road and would stay there four hours . &quot;
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell at himself . &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she placed her cell phone in order to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos from the police band and the people , crying , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the title : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
you watched a live @-@ feed in which a polic@@ eman stand before a group of prot@@ esters with a bell@@ ish dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , cleaned a different polic@@ eman , his ri@@ fle and cri@@ ed : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; that is not usual , &quot; &quot; reminded themselves of their statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we used to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to and which we can name typical .
at this moment I felt Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ fro@@ st .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a return trip and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock they took their 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; , &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11th century . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss of loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of people who live in the community and filled the streets to call answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a fl@@ ake and a suitable crown , came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning , about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remembered when I have taught you when black people have to fight for that , what they believe ? &quot; remember what she said . &quot;
&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police did a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
that which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know it and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it has to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck , you experience an experience where they personally have no bl@@ ec@@ at@@ ant racism , it is no different than the next black female child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would turn her a bad service to keep them away from them . &quot;
&quot; the first stop when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority who was a camp@@ ed place , as the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation by Officer of Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner , who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags in front and helped to pass them to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began to accept a new type of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after the 9th of August , she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urses Association and focused on Es@@ sens justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot;
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met during an evening @-@ demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the movie . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to document &quot; , &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document it or try to find a story that you can utilize ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of humans , often from White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and strength . &quot;
&quot; as follows recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area , who is known for his activ@@ ism as a point of deaths . &quot;
his commitment brought the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &apos; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &apos; in the years to Bro@@ wns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak &quot; , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells experience - to show that it comes to the movement &quot; not around a Messi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious candidate in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells life , how she loves himself and her wife mar@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; I felt as naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel and laugh@@ ed when they first saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and at the trans@@ gres@@ sor of black people .
in addition Ferr@@ ells history has repeated the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement that have shaped the movie &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as a weaker . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , pregnant women must carry the main last of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to notice , that &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not a affir@@ ming type of action , &quot; where Fer@@ rell was chosen as heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not acci@@ dental although it was at the front front , because during a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman stands as much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the message cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone , but the racial connections between the church and the police exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on gran@@ ting for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ age of a highway in a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area which she called her home : &quot; a Chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless it takes part in a singing and she feels obliged to this memory , since she went to the street three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; Si@@ w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people although it is not built long yet .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south @-@ end of the pedestrian zone was spl@@ its since the first presentation 2009 the people in supporters and opponents .
cold leaves the subject hardly anything .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic is discussed .
&quot; while the one to say about the bit &apos; gallery : &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be real &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ om ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; Si@@ w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the prop@@ on@@ ents are building that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , of which also the remaining deals are concerned , fear that the pedestrian zone . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery will be planned on the property , on which the accommodation market hall is currently marketed , in the 13 direct market market . &quot;
with the start of the construction work will be an end .
&quot; the Gallery @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a mark@@ eth@@ all in the new building - as well as for Bed@@ a space , with possibility of sitting outside . &quot;
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ owners are always very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
&quot; we would like that , even during and especially after the construction of the gallery , a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also this .
the small mark@@ eth@@ all in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; whether direct marketed in a market hall at Galerie an@@ sied@@ eln , comes to the height of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , these are likely not to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the purchase list in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothing , shoes , dr@@ one or supermarkets : I find that super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough of them in our city .
you see how many stores can be empty here - some have been empty for months and years .
&quot; but as there is not even one of the weekly weekly market there , it is all the more important that we remain at least the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is not price @-@ priced . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop@@ stores will be reserved in a shopping centre only by larger companies , for the dor@@ ms are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special stores there is almost no more and that which is still remaining , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with an a@@ thalle fit for me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
mainly : where is the farm@@ houses during the construction time ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on duration , if the bit @-@ gallery will actually appear . &quot;
&quot; or creates the gh@@ ost bit bit earlier , to distribute all the shops of Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which stands empty , also requires no one . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to encourage a real farmers market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a farmers &apos; thalle it is a lot - like I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg is not place any more .
&quot; when the farmers market hall is broken , there will be a piece of culture disappear . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost uncomfortable - those on cables depend on the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tup@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the cuts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ tic was born a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence , after she made publicly accepted diplomatic reports on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , A Bec@@ oming res@@ embl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline must be transformed into technology , computer science and art , and cre@@ ing , a Trans@@ wife and deb@@ tor , whose condem@@ nation from Barack Obama was transformed when he only had three days in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithms of DNA , which were extrac@@ ted by Mann@@ ing and from the 30 portraits , such as if someone can be interpreted with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ent determin@@ ants of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but has been openly talking about the identification as a woman , was sentenced in 2013 because of 20 indic@@ t@@ ments , including six violations of the sp@@ y network , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through prison , their picture was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only a single photo - a gran@@ ting , black @-@ wh@@ ie Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly sitting un@@ well on a seat and a plat@@ yp@@ ass can be associated with it . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; in this , the artist , portraits of stran@@ gers , produced from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cig@@ ar mu@@ te and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um , extrac@@ ted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
that was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a time to time .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while they were in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press show of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so she took contact with Chelsea , and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ uses became an un@@ equal pen@@ pal , which in the course of two years participated several letters exchanged . &quot;
&quot; you even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ pped Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; which would be fores@@ een a future where the president would det@@ ained ch@@ ev@@ ement and she was able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release would demand for seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ansas , was a welcome type of happy ig@@ nition . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp will lead to war against inform@@ ants out of the government and against trans@@ gender @-@ troops to find new , twe@@ et possible ways to make the rigi@@ d divisions that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; called De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen to come out of a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery written artistic statement demanded Mann@@ ing with its over@@ sized sig@@ natur@@ es , among them ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their surname ) is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic de@@ frag@@ mentation , their basis gender , racial , sexuality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written by thousands of C@@ s and GS and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hopes to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cl@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of artists of the artist ) , such as amazing , at least in biological ways , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring with it is that our gen@@ ome is not about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video @-@ work of 2007 , sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above Com@@ ic Nov@@ elle . &quot;
she shows teams as she re@@ appears with a free phone in the hands of the lack of discipline in the United States as King @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; when they place your speech , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; said the artist who greeted in Philadelphia . &quot;
I still keep go@@ os@@ eb@@ le when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was fores@@ try in the Com@@ ic@@ book , but when they should do it , then it will be welcomed into the center of the room by the masks , of their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ors that ro@@ ds themselves like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where her genetic data groups have been written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , as the movement , which was also behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford because of the k@@ iller
&quot; a national park @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and a staff of Oxford University , who were looking as susp@@ ects , after a man had been in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injury . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ t because of their alleged participation in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au were exhibited , as the acts of the Cook Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
&quot; one of the police authority of Chicago are published , community @-@ oriented Warn@@ em@@ itter , was discovered that the cor@@ pse on 27 July was discovered . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injury to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the spot of action for dead , and determin@@ ants investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are active after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them@@ self has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ jas will now be be@@ am@@ ated and excluded from the presence of the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal proposition which is examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ es . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury at Oxford University .
a speaker at the University and of the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and are prepared to help the U.S. government agencies in every conceivable way .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want it to be himself .
&quot; Chief Communications officer of the police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects strongly to put the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from building administration of the Grand @-@ Plaza building which had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , the said that in apartment 10@@ 08 has happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as a very cruel one .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it was clear whether the incident took place on July 27 . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the Management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the time axis , and the background of the victim , and expl@@ ores a variety of moti@@ fs , including a potential home event . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada driver plan in the near future , &quot; - Russian Per@@ cep@@ tible Mut@@ ko &quot;
&quot; Russian A@@ esi@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said , it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada driver plan has been updated in this regard , &quot; declared Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the website of the Organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could give concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list mentioned , however , that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities must publicly accept the reported results from the W@@ ada @-@ approved investigation by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren in the Russian sport publicly . &quot;
&quot; in regard to the matter , Mut@@ ko : &quot; we guide the investigation because our anti @-@ D@@ oping system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programmes , and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ual words agreed with those of Vital@@ y S@@ mir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ sport at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping organizations , then added : &quot; &quot; we have said repeatedly that the report is controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report uncondi@@ tionally , &quot; he added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of the implementation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after visiting the main qu@@ ires of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General @-@ General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ USA@@ DA turned into the right direction . &quot;

start ups that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke anonym@@ ity , some workers are not doing the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce H@@ air Care Gesellschaft Madison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has created people from outside to help .
a new race of the Human Resources Start @-@ ups is the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it allows companies to address surveys , specialist groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ n allow the C @-@ Suite leaders to handle and get directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Str@@ ava and Fit@@ Bit for your business , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools is used to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; salvation said that they have a better insight into what your employees think , and will feel with G@@ lin@@ t in the three years . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows on a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low additions , so you can di@@ ver why . &quot;
&quot; companies arrive at that time to stay at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then , a former staff published a blog post , who have talked to an environment of concern , who have been pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups as G@@ lin@@ t this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
&quot; the Global Governance , regulation and Compliance sectors could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value , after the budget@@ ary technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ tible , the company helps to prevent genuine behaviour and recognize that an ascen@@ ding interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; convert has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ tible enterprises tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and see the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with the employees to report a real behavior .
&quot; and when the main business guide is included , complaints should go directly to the Super@@ visory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has gathered the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his staff is badly treated or un@@ ethical , it can only experience costly consequences through consumers @-@ boy@@ cot@@ t , worker fluid , and mon@@ tage , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Conver@@ tible for more than a year to ensure that staff are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said , there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Conver@@ tible up , issues that have previously been hidden from managers who have been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair internship can be identified quicker . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree point of view in the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano which leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment and law disputes . &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , ethics , values and employee involvement in 2002 , after leaving the Ac@@ cor@@ ding company Arthur Ander@@ sen because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; Social Media came to her right &quot; &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ tible offer your software as a service , and prohi@@ bits the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model , and a chance that the approval of Venture Capital investors can be supported , both start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; convert $ 10 million in funding for funding in February of companies such as S@@ app@@ hire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which has raised the entire capital on $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; won $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assignments . &quot;
staff want to have the feeling that you are accepted and valued and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when men are glad to be in a company that their voices heard , and that work they &apos;re doing , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , which can be used both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve returns when their portfolio businesses are well running . businesses are working well if employees are working and engaged .
&quot; if the Analytics tools of third parties promise , dedication and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you can find support . &quot;
the data on staff engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrator of a firm do not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the changes will not come fast enough , or not at all , this can cultiv@@ ate the dis@@ appointments and appropri@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to rely heavily on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow employees , &quot; did you really hear me ? &quot;
do you take care of this ?
and whom you don &apos;t care about why should I ?
&quot; Madison Re@@ ed , which has now through monthly sal@@ v@@ eys , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , unable to add multiple teams within the company and add a communications training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights about the employees and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better relation of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men &quot; , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you lose also customers . &quot;
and if you lose customers then you will lose businesses .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it &apos;s going on 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers talk on one side of the new exercise areas of the team on campus .
some have drawn their tri@@ kot@@ es and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training .
for a good part of the team these unt@@ ary minutes represent a lunch break .
&quot; players who are in@@ scri@@ bed to the summer classes , will return after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 at the water ff Football Center . &quot;
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a short before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has prolonged their days - at least until the finale on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 clock to meet the player &apos;s already packed time plans . &quot;
the compromise was away from the two days is more than a day when the brood had moved to the beginning of the camp nearly a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six hours of playing in West wood .
they are to ab@@ ide in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of the formal gam@@ bl@@ ings for their clo@@ cking to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supports the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add a further point along the number of channels of players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden on three or four days on her , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed them down , they keep themselves further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really magnificent . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished , as in view of the clear views of its fields from an ad@@ joining parking space and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that is already decorated with foot@@ ball@@ ots , which will be a protective net behind one go@@ al@@ posts that will be no easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a sp@@ ains that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far to think about the people there is a room and then adjust there to draw a practice . &quot;
&quot; when you have the video of an exercise , it is a fairly good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too big worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ feit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fal@@ seh@@ ood on fac@@ tion pages of third party and show their results under the original contribution then said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake news .
&quot; the company , in an opinion on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods which will begin to recognize possible mis@@ responses and to send them to fac@@ tion test , which may display results of fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so called F@@ ake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the U.S. presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue , whereby the French voters were floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany should be pun@@ ished a plan , after the social media networks should be pun@@ ished unless it manages to eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook said in a separate declaration in German , that in the U.S. , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be launched a test of new facts . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the recognition , which stories are challenged by fac@@ ul@@ ties of third parties , people want more context to make well @-@ founded decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook @-@ News in one blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature of the &quot; related articles &quot; and working on other changes to its News @-@ Fe@@ ed to reduce false news .
creating a com@@ ic @-@ service : a castle in the history of England
in his younger history the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ up@@ time for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ he .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Gau@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the period from Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have only re@@ acted to the thum@@ b on the side of a letter , which was written by a double bed in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ bs !
&quot; and letters always cra@@ wl up to smoke , because at that time there was a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself would be . &quot;
&quot; I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who struck up with old papers , he will be supported by National Trust and the Arts Council England and almost four months lived in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have lost my Welcome &apos; and this seems to be all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ opo@@ lies on the walls and the bottles spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated by the grounds and ruins of the ancient castle , and spoke with landsc@@ ap@@ ors , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust was only received in 2006 the full access was considered the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes started a decade later , the employee started to take care of the archive that he said than &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ok@@ es said &quot; Oh , really bu@@ zz it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; books books , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , maps , who poss@@ essed : &quot; &quot; one could mean that Land@@ conf@@ lic@@ ted would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ar to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pull on bre@@ aded bases in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to tap into the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that emerged 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ fe &apos; of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
the farm arose in this area and I thought an u@@ prising was a good beginning .
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jes@@ u@@ it &apos;s family , the family of Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell represented by the 18th century that he met a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only years later was formed when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &quot; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the men seemed to be fairly in@@ cro@@ ok , getting back debt and spend money on things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men extingu@@ ished their debt crisis by married rich old women - I imagine they as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advertise erotic . &quot;
after the end of his use at the castle Rhodes on the search for other unique writer experiences
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel on El@@ ev@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which has since been called back by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ n life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the envel@@ ope of the 301 year old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef on Friday has launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
until Thursday Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan to Nelson Art@@ z .
&quot; at the end of August , it is meant to be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? &quot; ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters in the rh@@ en@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write it on their yesterday released website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in the action it is about more than &quot; &quot; only &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is called on . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that the city gives an un@@ mistak@@ eable extra . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a mid @-@ five @-@ dig@@ it amount will be the city of Bad Honnef and its new umbrella and the campaign .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August consul@@ ts in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pensions and carriage in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the prime minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; at the presidency of the state , the presidency of the government also took part in the five recipes , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the transition . &quot;
the government moves to the military on the military .
&quot; head of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were set off . &quot;
since the failed cou@@ gan has folded Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the exile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as a wire of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people who have been involved immediately on the coup attempt , is being negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the put@@ sch , Erdo@@ gan had given the overthrow of Erdo@@ gan as &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; as he give him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan is really under control the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hürriyet &quot; published an article titled &quot; Un@@ insist on Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general Staff there are concerns about a growing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army which manifes@@ ts among others in the abolition of the head@@ scar@@ ed ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the big pe@@ pper in the army and the security guards goes on at any rate .
&quot; mid July Erdo@@ gan per decre@@ e made another 73@@ 95 citizenship , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 54@@ 6 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it seemed that Erdo@@ gan was p@@ umped on the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als of old earlier than the actual men of the country .
three times she put@@ ted her role as guar@@ dian of the world@@ ly state order .
&quot; after his election , Erdo@@ gan finally pushed the power of the military step by step , not least in appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan water@@ mark specifically targeted at Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; V@@ oc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; named &quot; &quot; V@@ oc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; named after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; management structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immig@@ rant plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees to lower the legal immigrants on 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary working permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by changing the way the citizens from other countries of green cards are issued . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will benefit , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to become a track for racing @-@ growing
&quot; over the past few months , over the past few months have been spar@@ ed on the future of the race @-@ boo@@ ks@@ y - now it should be quite fast . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year it is supposed to be built on the mar@@ riages , where the tourist car goes , built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race @-@ boo@@ l in the long term , the transport of the traffic of affairs is to start working on the track in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and transfer the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g further and to ob@@ struction , the country conver@@ ts itself especially for the tourism &apos;s important connection , &quot; declared traffic @-@ secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of restoring the track is about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the country exce@@ eding 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered from the country in the future , is now finally matched , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Railway Station also agree on the technical details already .
&quot; thus the road @-@ plan , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tr@@ aded , &quot; &quot; S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed down for a period of eleven years .
hence the race track record was ordered on December 2017 .
the racing track is mainly among tourists popular rail connection between the train stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the course of a pilot department has been tested in the course of a pilot department , whether the course of sufficient many people will be used to order them once again . &quot;
the track is also very heavy in parts .
the rise of sex robot is real and we ought to worry
&quot; just as you thought it may not be crazy , a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
&quot; recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) , a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ fied professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take up their rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fingers . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex doll@@ s have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a si@@ lic@@ ally that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robots accordingly according to his con@@ vic@@ tions , &quot; and thereby select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or color of his fingers . &quot;
&quot; but it is still disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; , &quot; which would like a Step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive . &quot;
modern sex doll@@ s have become robots with a si@@ lic@@ on skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robots allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties , which they find appealing like for example . &quot;
&quot; and then there is still that of True Comp@@ ani@@ on developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre@@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conv@@ eys the impression of rel@@ tern@@ ess and &quot; &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ med the website of True Comp@@ ani@@ on . &quot;
&quot; so may they like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
during the day she also has their m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in the mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robot@@ ic robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the sub@@ mer@@ ged female characteristics , when one enters a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is said here : res@@ eg@@ rowing ) Far@@ rah goes , un@@ tranquil a most . &quot;
on his website true True Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why do men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another shy . &quot;
their development and increasing sophistic@@ ation point out of something dar@@ ker and deeper into our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
&quot; most men will of course hold no Sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ marked their rising popularity , they remain preliminary at the edge of consumption culture . &quot;
&quot; but what ro@@ se@@ ated out of the edge @-@ zones , in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not wei@@ rd or irrit@@ ating , until they give the free market this permission . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain reason@@ ing that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time where the rights of women are threatened in the White House , who has prev@@ ailed to have women sexually attacked . &quot;
the ab@@ out@@ most aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tales &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images that we@@ aving the body and the stolen eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
&quot; the goal behind these sex robot is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to real women as realistic as technically feasible ( though , with porno@@ graphic proportions ) . &quot;
&quot; your buil@@ ders want that they feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; figures , &quot; the robots are not a real female . &quot;
you cannot separate yourself from their companions or simply go away .
&quot; they have no placement or a background history , nothing but what is hin@@ dered on independence or anything that could inter@@ fere with the imagination . &quot;
otherwise expressed : they are counter@@ part slaves .
or to express it in the phrases of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the in@@ comprehen@@ sion of the healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a bond @-@ wel@@ ded of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the US voters , but also families in the small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest , there was in the US newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp sel@@ enium relatives . &quot;
we rigor@@ ously give us all alleg@@ edly to burst our fil@@ tering bub@@ bles .
&quot; less notices is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , families . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , an left @-@ oriented poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ dre@@ d , with which they fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite peculi@@ ar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table , this certainly is a good thing , but it is due to me in another connection that this can also bring considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gray way that we will no longer rep@@ el the kitt@@ ens of one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a still scar@@ ed long @-@ time scenario , in the Tru@@ mp Republi@@ can of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alised , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as an in@@ comprehen@@ sion of denial . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s com@@ ic version of mad@@ ness - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ah , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how its tax return saw ) - both in fact appear to be a very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of Republi@@ can only be spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify as in@@ estim@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousine was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel of Central Park , the biggest of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollar you can spend in the city if you do not need a caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are huge large , the fiber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all cl@@ owns are cris@@ p@@ y and the animals revol@@ ve to look at full fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and clim@@ atic music brings this in a worthy manner . &quot;
so many stere@@ otypes of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old ; the sky@@ lines will become familiar to provide much excitement and the reality of the city becomes the dream not just .
&quot; five @-@ five years later , and I still didn &apos;t think of the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the theme @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ carousel is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year period can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could judge the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked for that . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I were forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before using my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same plus the option to charge the rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slo@@ wing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , it also exercises pressure on the server to bring the personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor wife in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I tired the experience made to reach my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us attacked with breast pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital stay .
&quot; in the past year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his hand@@ book , which he suffered the prison authorities according to a fall in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned for a first tot@@ ality of prosec@@ ut@@ ors in favour of murder of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed steam in the early hours of St. Valent@@ ine in 2013 by taking it several times through a door of the toil@@ et@@ aker in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria on her .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night @-@ time in@@ tru@@ der , who stood in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal , from which they say , be too im@@ patient . &quot;
&quot; the national prosec@@ ution authority said that they will be lifted to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us exp@@ ires danger , that his sentence increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer was a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Flo@@ berger schools , the district s@@ äs@@ s@@ ler were made out of guns and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen to the holidays and to the further schools . &quot;
three of the withdraw@@ als then go to the gram@@ mar school , four to the Real@@ School . &quot;
&quot; school @-@ headed Angel@@ ica Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen , &quot;
&quot; as a symbol of leaving the 29 pupils of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schum@@ acher and Reg@@ ine Meder a young eag@@ le , who grows in the chickens , but then into freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the m@@ ex Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; Der Adler in the Chi@@ n@@ erhof . &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to bro@@ ods from his h@@ ens . &quot;
instead of a chicken egg a small eag@@ le came out .
&quot; but the hope to make from him a chicken , cutting himself , the eag@@ le spreads to a high mountain its wings and escap@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the recording of Yvonne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylin@@ dri@@ es , around the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eag@@ le stand for the integration , he said Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten be different from the other young kitt@@ ens ( chic@@ ks ) , but they belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his mission is to be free .
she wished every quarter se@@ duc@@ er that he feels in his new school .
&quot; it was followed by the colleague , the former school director Michael Müller , who is always jumping into the Lev@@ ant , and the parents representatives . &quot;
the kitchen @-@ time is now over , the school teachers Sophia Schum@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; she lay her students only very hungry after two years , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; after all , it was able to rely on the neighborhoods . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
in doing so it broke great joy in the children .
for the new school year eight first @-@ class boats are registered .
two Bulg@@ arians captured because of illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , distributed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , c@@ ited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , in Si@@ th@@ onia the police were captured by a group of illegal van@@ ity people , among them the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day she was released , while an examination was running . &quot;
the State Department reported b@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free camps and place to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable money pen@@ alties . &quot;

software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected are now to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates are available for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the emissions behaviour of cars of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents :
is the new promotion compul@@ sory ?
&quot; no , the tr@@ aded software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates are only valid for the vehicles , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has been arranged the Kraft@@ anlagen @-@ Federal Chanc@@ ellery ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers inform about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a fast implementation in the next few months , but still not mentioned an exact date . &quot;
Daim@@ ler has communicated to write every person concerned .
&quot; if any inspection is required , this will be done in their context . &quot;
how long have the conversion to be done altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the Att@@ ach@@ ment from the commitment of the manufacturers as well as by political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , volunte@@ ered and not so far the car manufacturers in the subject of the environment are not so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could it be to get an appointment .
&quot; what are drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ? &quot;
the ACE continues to wait .
&quot; probably , foreign manufacturers would draw further , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is now a massive prize case of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE fear that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where passengers are dro@@ wn . &quot;
there has so far been no value for older diesel until now .
A@@ ce won &apos;t wait to wait for a sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the Gl@@ ory Events in Washington .
&quot; the first prize @-@ giving under President Tru@@ mp promises to be politically , politically . &quot;
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rap@@ per one of the cov@@ eted prizes of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution on Thursday , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograp@@ her Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman LE@@ AR ( 95 ) . &quot;
the awards will be delivered in early December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
the LE@@ AR winners of the LE@@ AR announced that it is already announced to rel@@ inqu@@ ish the participation in the g@@ ala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New York Times &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - and even provo@@ ke the means of pul@@ ling the means - and that is stres@@ sing me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to make her point of view . &quot;
&quot; according to the former president John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; of the previous price @-@ makers count Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into ann@@ u@@ ity in the coming year . &quot;
the job is already written - suitable applicants are however r@@ ar .
since 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work keeps him still great fun as he conv@@ ent in the press .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is a surprise that so far there is no application for requirements . &quot;
the city looks for the next time a architects or engineer .
this is to be done - under consideration of the regular cancellation of the time - even enough time for a review .
&quot; since Has@@ l@@ ach functions for the administrative community as sub @-@ law authority , the applicant needs to be appropriate to the applicant . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they cannot fill in any more , the citizen would have to go advice until Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but brus@@ h@@ ern@@ ers be the city and himself important , says W@@ acker , who reported from a good company li@@ ma as well as a good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , several major projects have accumulated , on the W@@ acker can look back with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is certain about the building office and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future we have varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ arrangement of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ burg place are increased .
&quot; the Kin@@ esi@@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed , also the stadium , is still subject to issue . &quot;
&quot; the latter is the latter alone will strike with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; if we &apos;re right &quot; , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all have great tasks to my successor .
work here is fun . &quot;
left @-@ aged for a city @-@ champion big room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own building yard and gar@@ dener could be quite flexible respon@@ ds .
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green equipment will often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town as an ensemble under monument protection is important , it is important to have &quot; an eye for what is going to be &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , stresses the schei@@ der Stadt@@ bau@@ master . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ master stands high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is the client , &quot; in the end everything is running here over my table . &quot;
he can count on many years of service and coordination with many years of experience : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working with Manfred Schön@@ er ( mining ) for 15 years .
&quot; also that his successor is long , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who wants to really identify and remain in place with the place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good company atmosphere but also for the further design of the city .
&quot; who would like to be be@@ aten to find the city of Has@@ l@@ ach , for information about the city of Has@@ l@@ ach , as a diploma engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree of expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning . &quot;

bicycle on lines thrown : south ground track closed
&quot; according to the police , the far @-@ known offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the track @-@ track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines . &quot;
&quot; these have been so severely damaged , that the her@@ edit@@ ary goods have had to be stopped . &quot;
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators and look for the night hours after them .
near the scene have been observed by witnesses a pink sco@@ op and a bike driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ en@@ st@@ reich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA . &quot;
the perpetrators brought himself into great danger and are threatened by train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the installation , as well as the delay in the cost of rail traffic and the cost of rail traffic may also come to the offen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; altogether , from a &quot; significant &quot; sum to go out , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic in the south @-@ line track could be led without disabilities . &quot;
almost ten person@@ ages were fre@@ ed on Friday afternoon 2 of them charged the remote traffic .
&quot; goods are not covered , but they had a delay . &quot;
L@@ oud @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 meter upper lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( inflammation or cabinet ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet , which is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and milk products , could all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with infl@@ amed intestinal diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition , which in the U.S. affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000 , causes stomach cr@@ amps and paraly@@ sis , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the affected is usually going to avoid meat and milk products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , they found researchers at the Washing@@ toner University , that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by protein contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the researcher researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rolling , to make sure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes that hide in the food not en@@ ade in the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells , which promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ ming tissues . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in a inflammatory intestinal diseases . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , there was found that a sort of tolerance @-@ promoting immun@@ isation is found in mice , which wear a certain bacter@@ ium in its branches . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food had , the more they had from this immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of the yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ant , less inflammatory intestinal lining , if the same system also acqu@@ ires with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doc@@ torate @-@ in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an studied a kind of immun@@ isation that promotes tolerance as she found out that a group of studies had such cells , but another group of the same tribe but which was separate , that did not have . &quot;
&quot; they thought that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ omen of the mice , had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the stomach intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the har@@ ms of the mice became DNA sequ@@ encing , and there were six species of bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells , but without it lacking in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in an ster@@ ile environment , so that they did not find a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they were not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ th@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria spread on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ th@@ i left in a fluid and over@@ led small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant @-@ toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; as the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food feed double , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ se@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells dropped by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us are tr@@ acked in our stomach intestinal tr@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han products from L. reu@@ th@@ i develop the cells in humans to develop like mice , but defects in genes in relation to Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory intestinal diseases . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ th@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic is a &quot; genius &quot; committed
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million Po@@ unds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup began on Tuesday , and impressive in the old role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; MAT@@ IC had however been excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho was to improve that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready sooner than later .
in addition to M@@ atic start@@ led also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his Start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the independent un@@ vei@@ led this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wish three further rest@@ or@@ ations , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic work , &quot; three of his four prime ministers . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the club &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four , but they gave great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US @-@ plane manufacturers Boeing has the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky painted .
&quot; the pil@@ ots flew by Seattle in the U.S. state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers via the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the rad@@ ar sun the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a per@@ sever@@ est for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising earlier .
&quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted in the sky . &quot;
new repository for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
&quot; however , as the wind turning : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still SPD @-@ Chief , at the first social @-@ democratic Prime Minister before elections always with a certain concern after Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only no stor@@ fires from the party central , merely no head@@ wind from the covenant - so it was the most important desire of the elec@@ toral campaign@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has been fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees are monitoring of the Willy Brandt @-@ House with growing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not even be described in the approach . &quot;
there were low @-@ ups .
and one after another .
&quot; the federal state @-@ CD@@ U is looking for a surprising end to the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green cannot be very reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber the Edit@@ ing@@ Network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tional frac@@ ture of a Green Party has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the day @-@ election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its A @-@ cast majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Federation of Michael Kell@@ ner asked the Ab@@ ün@@ de Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ IN to return their mandate to rede@@ em their mandate .
the tak@@ eover of the CD@@ U means a clear distor@@ tion of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ants must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the federal leader and elec@@ toral campaign@@ ing in the green of the Red@@ Green Network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not all be true , si@@ ghing up a SPD election fighters than on Friday morning the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ ship reaches the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ants to the CD@@ U without their own ruling majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD @-@ state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , more cal@@ med the comrades of his time . &quot;
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia everything will be different .
that was then also - and it was all much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ pl@@ edge Haute the party smooth . &quot;
&quot; however , the comrades come back in the weeks after that . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just finished new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with it the next low @-@ attack .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , in that weekend he lost its Nim@@ bus because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he was in crisis communication , then quite everything was false , what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z is fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ car@@ bure@@ tor and its role in the Super@@ visory Board the defe@@ ats had already been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese re@@ ques@@ tioning came .
&quot; nevertheless , or maybe just that , Wei@@ l tried more and stronger in the past weeks to set up the brief@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the desire of the former mayor of Hanover , his power to extend in Berlin , also comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz continued to be hidden . &quot;
they let him give him because they said to be a stabili@@ zation of the party from Wei@@ l .
&quot; well , the exact opposite could enter . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party internal constraints , the lower Gre@@ ens is basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz already at all .
&quot; sometimes , the comrades strive to hold its own ranks . &quot;
&quot; anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the tr@@ end@@ ent parliament@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as wife T@@ ania places their own career paths on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , leader of the Party parliament in the SPD parliamentary group , the editors of Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ west has not been elected to the parliament because of her person as a director , but over the country list of the Dutch Gre@@ ens , so the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische MEP . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD parliamentary group , lam@@ ents a &quot; &quot; non @-@ democratic man@@ o@@ eu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vote for four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on candidate to the German Bundestag in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ N@@ D . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U parliament@@ arians joined the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called to clarify the background information .
&quot; I will know if there has been more or there is additional commitments to the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
support for Plac@@ ing III
who wants to san@@ i@@ fy his house to the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg Stadt@@ development on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a glimp@@ se on the so far happened .
since 1991 it has been telling in sensitive re@@ development areas .
&quot; at that time , in the San@@ ation Region I from 1991 to 2004 , the land of Baden @-@ Württemberg has even been adopted in two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the San@@ ation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler the former San@@ ings are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to encourage the inter@@ development , and not only new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , you will receive the information on the Prime Minister in Karlsruhe on April 4 , that there will be a renovation III . &quot;
&quot; the promot@@ er amount 833 Euro , of which came about 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the municipality . &quot;
so what is the result of a re@@ organisation ?
&quot; we will continue to examine , examine , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area would be interest in an interest . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territory could also be postp@@ oned again . &quot;
the pier spent on Wednesday evening Martin Keller but Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the Bund @-@ federal program &quot; &quot; Social city &quot; , &quot; where the refur@@ bish@@ ments would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of interior towns , improving living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , which is called per plot . &quot;
the san@@ itation area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the payment period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; however , until September this year the survey would only be conducted during those arriving at the retro@@ fitting region to fill out a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December the stat@@ utes of the stat@@ utes , can be started in November or December , so that in the coming year with the renov@@ ations can be started . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that each Comm@@ une could conduct the dar@@ ed advance investigations .
&quot; it is a matter of jud@@ ging and decide the city @-@ league ab@@ norm@@ alities and decide when it is , and to what extent . &quot;
I will then also be entered into the book for the respective property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again once more and get a picture of the situation , she spoke . &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed a key success factor for the project is the participation of the parties involved .
&quot; for this reason , questionn@@ aires will be sent to citizens over the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and property bows , &quot; in which it is among other things about the construc@@ tional state and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and residen@@ ces &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a living room . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; factory &quot; &quot; is only accessible when in building business rooms are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , in note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a distinctive questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; &quot; Wind@@ Hund@@ red@@ zip &quot; &quot; - who comes first , mah@@ le first . &quot;
&quot; you can not book funding for &quot; &quot; later &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally photographs of the project &quot; &quot; Plac@@ ing II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; sav@@ our@@ y . &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tish invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to arrive with a hand@@ movement in house and car
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that it can open its door@@ step , enter its office and can even start with a hand@@ piece of movement . &quot;
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ es@@ thesi@@ sts in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , joined to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedure is performed after medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the firm of North@@ on also wants to change the locks of houses and cars , that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; married father of one has now been installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the cost @-@ cost of the White House costs tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a nav@@ y helic@@ opter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event that cuts the American production last month , cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the claims of the military , which have been entru@@ sted to the T@@ IME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and headed officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ opter was issued in Connecticut , next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House required the presence of the helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter on the South La@@ wn landed , according to the records of Marine Hel@@ ic@@ opter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to be aware that you are aware of because it is an unusual event with high visibility , the com@@ mander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the dep@@ uty prime minister for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helic@@ opter arrived at the South La@@ wn in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long until the lawn were cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note add that , in case of departure from the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to the restriction of the hours a second team would need to return . &quot;
&quot; the original flight was found during the event at the helic@@ opter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time . &quot;
the records made out of the T@@ IME provided will not be clear if a second flight reservation was required .
the H@@ atch Act has to use federal states to use public ownership for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could harm the destination .
&quot; a question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the dep@@ uty command@@ ing command . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was referred to the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus for the reform of the healthcare reform , which was in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the effort of restr@@ aint of government rules . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly any new phenomenon . &quot;
Presidents are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
&quot; Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February , as the presidential plane in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained on the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states is shown to be manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty spokes@@ person of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ occupation often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in South La@@ wn by placing the US President in the White House with precise Zen@@ timeters .
&quot; as a Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House , led 58 exercises . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event at the training needs of the flight plan for the month , said an official . &quot;
helic@@ opter @-@ units flew in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support versions . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other re@@ qu@@ ites , presented at the event . &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in the helic@@ opter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not subordin@@ ate a budget design@@ ations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the Ministry of Defence , for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D refund fee for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
record of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of operating the helic@@ opter go far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for funding rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; this estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 included the expenses for DO@@ D not the personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract agreement . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I am assum@@ ing that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent . &quot;
&quot; and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; it is of course reasonable , the highlight . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear if Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acted with the helic@@ opter , when he entered his tour through the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the seat of fire@@ man cars . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before ben@@ ding task
&quot; pioneer of the Second World War Bundes@@ liga , in the tab@@ ular Su@@ ff@@ dor@@ fer SV . &quot;
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will be staged tomorrow from 11@@ am in Kiel at the Tab@@ bert &apos;s Su@@ ff@@ dor@@ fer SV .
&quot; despite five games still mak@@ eover balance sheet , the leader of the Second World War Bundes@@ liga has got the sense of reality . &quot;
at least the team of Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has no respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays a similar formation . &quot;
&quot; right on the rear positions , I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV especially the imports from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their plans and Finn@@ s can even refer to assignments in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ er@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; it is as always hard for us .
&quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could be Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; at the moment it is still the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man , who is currently working at the tournament in Czech Liber@@ ec play Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for his first deployment in this season . &quot;
the hitherto un@@ occupied Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the ball .
&quot; he should be in Kiel and as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ro@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
after his two victories last Sunday for the Club at the Al@@ ster could again be back to the team from Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z .
&quot; enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was in January 2016 still the number one of the Jun@@ i@@ ores world list , don &apos;t fill someone out of the coach around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the cad@@ res . &quot;
how America can harm the OM@@ V
&quot; really happy Donald Tru@@ mp does not , when he put his signature under the law of tigh@@ tening the sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; in his p@@ ast , the law was en@@ acted , the Congress made a few &quot; constitutional regulations &quot; , &quot; estimated . &quot;
&quot; the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed against the US advancement . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft looks ahead to pun@@ ish European companies that help Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , Invest@@ ors are concerned with other European companies , jointly with other European companies , the Nord Stream 2 has been co @-@ financed with other European companies . &quot;
the dr@@ ones is violent .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil group . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions as far as executive order for life . &quot;
twelve weapons are at the same time .
&quot; the press &quot; &quot; has viewed , which the Group could deny and which could be really sore . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is focused on the hub of Net@@ fli@@ x .
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ Di@@ k@@ iller is un@@ vei@@ led , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the stag@@ gered three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received her first trailer and showed the latest Bö@@ se@@ ers of the Show . &quot;
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
&quot; led by four powerful implants , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une @-@ 500 companies &quot; only with more state bri@@ des and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; G@@ IL@@ BER@@ TO Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Alc@@ az@@ ar ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) command@@ ing the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ epe Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal is returning as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the type , the American and Colom@@ bian criminal enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are Matias Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ estre , Kerry Bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;

roll back@@ wards : the city is 46 cu@@ ch@@ enh@@ il@@ fen .
the city organiz@@ es the c@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
the clock is turned down in the urban day@@ care centres .
&quot; on September 1 , the city Kre@@ feld takes over the me@@ al@@ location in the urban centre care centres ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , dep@@ uty head office in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; we all have very happy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , your house is cooked except house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh@@ ly cooked . &quot;
&quot; the city runs in the fields of the fields of 46 children &apos;s Day@@ care , in 44 the children are getting a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; last year @-@ year , 28@@ 00 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile we eat not only children who are served 45 weekly hours , in the c@@ ita for mid@@ day , &quot; explains Pom@@ p@@ ancy . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , when children until 14 . &quot;
&quot; 46 Parti@@ cip@@ ants have from 1 September kitchen service : they warm up the angel@@ ic foods , complement them around salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , rooms off , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ y . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group institutions as well as seventh institutions - decide about the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen people now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot;
because it is about healthy eating and cooking .
the kids should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the chef &apos;s team is there useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing men . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the inf@@ ants of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the kitchen staff - is now done by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance as well as the charm , which they have put themselves in cost @-@ comparison between self @-@ suff@@ iciency and foreign ownership for the city as the most economical , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 sections will be re@@ hired . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the extraction area not as strong into the weight , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ p@@ ancy . &quot;
&quot; the Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , &quot; says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative when all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , am@@ ot@@ ender director of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women are run in the provinces in the provinces . three women can@@ als for the role of vice @-@ president and over 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
&quot; elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble , when women fully participate and be involved in all parts of the election process . &quot;
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5 .
the Taliban have published threats against a election process which coinci@@ des with the transition from international martial art to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be the power to be peaceful from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will increase the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an independent election Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3,@@ 6 million voters .

G@@ MB @-@ concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union would like to know with the managers of the Bis@@ cu@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said : the company had to weigh about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which includes beside other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea cookies . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
&quot; he added that staff and trade union officials would learn as the first &quot; &quot; if their actions would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the branches of the company called for G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to say &quot; &quot; concerns to express that the funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organiz@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win over the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ Cross as well as our members . &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workforce focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , among the perspective of jobs , the wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising life of life and of the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow , an escal@@ ating production at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of Pl@@ adi@@ s said , &quot; The lad@@ der in T@@ oll@@ cross has only yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland and will respond directly to the company as we estimate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; we had two months ago a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
we discussed with the employees that we work like all companies who are operating in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe economic climate . our stores are ongoing - and this applies to all our business sectors and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; in recent years , we added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of rab@@ ies as a production site . should our operations be changed at the location , the employees and their trade union officials will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ned three years prior to N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the website of La Liga is your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave behind in their persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after having signed an offer of £ 189 million to sc@@ rap his free movement , but have they war@@ ned three years ago before the world stage . &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has stopped the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the highest pro @-@ day ath@@ l@@ ete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages from more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out outside , although a source located near the Catal@@ ans and insi@@ sted that the club has always given his best to take care of his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 to take care of it . &quot;
but was the football world war@@ ned three years ago by the PS@@ G president in front of this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club , who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know if they touch one of our players , then we will contact them , we will contact her players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players in themselves , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded that line , being the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that she would not allow the International of Italy to leave behind any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by having one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Review submitted Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report about the ab@@ norm@@ ality failures dischar@@ ged Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse of abuse at the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform@@ movement &quot; We are Church &quot; &quot; stated after publication from the Deutsche Reg@@ ensburger Bishop and today Kar@@ d@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the former Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or at that time wrong assessment of processes . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; is said to be cri@@ tici@@ zed that in the reporting of violence at Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , with &quot; two levels . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no doubt that it would be pun@@ ished and sham@@ eful deeds that would have to be pun@@ ished and in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; such as the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ af@@ fia , histori@@ ography , and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committees . &quot;
&quot; the habit of design@@ ate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience , is already part of the day @-@ day experience and is preparing public opinion that is for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ af@@ fia . &quot;
also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; you can go on to the church and that is a great deal .
&quot; he pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; had been a quite normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; , &quot; in order to be done with nau@@ ghty children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse there often also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; completely w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly , the author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann , who spoke with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ man , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he adds up the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the education institution Ulrich Weber released ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s , with high Pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; &quot; to summ@@ ing up , that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms physical and psych@@ ic violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially at high emotion@@ ality , the punishment was able to fall fier@@ ce for the pupils at the same time . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike numerous other def@@ endants , that many victims coinci@@ de the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence might even combine positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview H@@ Hes@@ man , why the final report for abuse at the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger from his opinion was reli@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; inci@@ dents of non @-@ violence &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a paradox@@ ical picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one time , many students consider his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the other , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfection that was tangible for the Ö@@ f@@ teren when a dom@@ sp@@ atz has not brought a top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when you read the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front up to the back , one has to ask why the name of George R@@ atz@@ inger thinks about it at all . &quot;
he is dedicated to him just eight sides and he is clearly acqu@@ itted by any suspic@@ ion of medi@@ ums or fellow @-@ cler@@ k in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
&quot; also , the ex@@ propri@@ ation of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ schule is outside his sphere of efficiency . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to raise it ( if necessary , too late , or first did not take seriously enough of it . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ a school , on which he acting , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - so literally - &quot; &quot; rede@@ mption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger produces an excellent testimony , describes it as &quot; warm , &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; knowled@@ geable , &quot; &quot; knowled@@ geable , &quot; and &quot; comprehen@@ sible &quot; , &quot; who gro@@ omed the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always by grapes . &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ tionist and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to W@@ ut@@ ech@@ arts . &quot;
&quot; that he was not only kn@@ itted with chairs and threw the sl@@ ew , and the s@@ laughter , and too old guys passed on to the hair or ears , he did not regret years ago , deeply depl@@ ores and exc@@ used for this . &quot;
&quot; however , to its honour , however , it must be said that such educ@@ ators were used in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and the 1970s , widespread in parents like with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding techniques ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us , who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a tempor@@ al school , a state @-@ Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what about what is actually written in this report , the plac@@ eable sexual abuse and non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school , are the most certainly dre@@ d@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; you ask yourself whether it is not more familiar with his famili@@ arity and his role as the brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ VIII , that many media have just rus@@ hed to him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bav@@ arian Pope many who have never understood it , still free@@ zing . &quot;
but the truth is : the report dischar@@ ged Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , the report was reported much about the topic of abuse at the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also laid out some rel@@ uc@@ tance or li@@ fel@@ lowship with regard to sexual abuse the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no single of the 67 victims of sexual trans@@ gri@@ ps claims to have become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; I have never dre@@ amed with my father or mother to talk about it , &quot; said one subject to the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
&quot; the true issue of the education of sexual abuse was , yet , is that most of the victims should be silent . &quot;
&quot; if they didn &apos;t even arise such parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators yet . &quot;
how do the cathedral @-@ cats have a role in terms of abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a respon@@ dent disciple form@@ ulates it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he appropri@@ ates ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely insight and could have been allowed to stop the perpetrators .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that themselves eradi@@ cated him ... Bub@@ bles in@@ tru@@ er or clear@@ er or even more likely , than opposite their parents , dormit@@ ory , confidence , instruc@@ tors , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that the students involved in the prior @-@ term students and / or their environment could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore acqu@@ itted by any fellow citizens . &quot;
&quot; thus , it cannot be thrown out , neither prevents it or brought to the display . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it has happened in some cases . &quot;
in the media a lot of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; in the media was to read about the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown out in the report &quot; Walk . &quot;
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and dec@@ eived was led to a huge melanchol@@ y of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; yet , this is precisely the abuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; there will be clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gram@@ mar school of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence and , we say once , other pre@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductor of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole fool@@ ish@@ ly ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which bu@@ ys of s@@ adi@@ sti@@ cal teachers are regulated and mal@@ ign@@ ited , and among them were ign@@ ited at the pres@@ ch@@ schule in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be cured . &quot;
&quot; but with those who had Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger nothing to do , for he got the boys only to face when they were already at the cathedral @-@ side school . &quot;
&quot; on the same way , as most witnesses emphasize the topic &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
it was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &apos; heavenly &apos; conditions .
what was different from the place @-@ in school ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline , but there was no s@@ adi@@ ed violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; a lot of victims had seen the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence against violence . &quot;
&quot; thus , at the most there is still the accus@@ ation to have blo@@ wn away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts the report could only define two periods , in which it was reported from the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself just and was responsible for the walks at a school , at which he didn &apos;t want to hear and responsible ( such a witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again by 1993 . &quot;
index@@ ing Georg R@@ atz@@ inger off of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael H@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral square , which the report was even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in this , he points out that in the pre @-@ school , the test will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; even in view of the danger of negative press , he received urgent action . &quot;
&quot; it was of course at a time when legal clarity existed , when it was recently forbidden in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before that , they opened up in a legal gray area , like each one of us knows yet to know . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where the person might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the per@@ missible border had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but one cannot say , he could have looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
in 1980 the examination of schools were officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too .
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said yes , it is unfair to apply the present educational standard to the then time . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we were talking about the &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of the An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger of the past to present today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has already left .
&quot; but this is of course not true for sexual abuse that was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and also not for what happened in the pre @-@ school and violence to inno@@ cent inf@@ ants , which goes far beyond that time . &quot;
that is all quite aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be up .
&quot; but at the same time , I must take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ chers and in hair and ears to pull were widely used in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as physical punishment was then forbidden , he is also strictly ab@@ duc@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; what image of his Reg@@ ensburger Time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger took place in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
was the subject of evidence also in the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told his perspective , as the cathedral @-@ cats played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not know that he carried a stric@@ ter Reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said that without this perfec@@ tionist without paying unconditional love , it would probably have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ smit@@ ters , true cultural amb@@ assador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went to the USA twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone one makes no great singers and ever before every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of person have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : from the work on the book and beyond I have come to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really quite well and again experienced as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , hum@@ ble , deep @-@ believing and heart@@ ed people from which one could not imagine it even a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly come up with how many former dom@@ ic@@ ult still today , 23 years after its em@@ bodi@@ ment , regularly contact him , visit him - he is almost blind and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not given him to this day , so that he was strictly among them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; most of the domains are grateful to him today , that he enriched her life and has provided the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , v@@ esti@@ al teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but nevertheless a lovely dis@@ respectful person , to which they still have a look and to honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , even quite clearly : all that one thro@@ ws it , are educ@@ ators , which were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad we have overcome this time ago .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just one man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an still prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; that is the evil intent , which is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just released , was dischar@@ ged him . &quot;
&quot; now the beginning @-@ year @-@ old man would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who would have acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps no one would probably know the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
