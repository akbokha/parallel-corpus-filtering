<seg id="8">"the historic maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of Geoportas in Bavaria of the government, are anything but up to date - but that is why it is very revealing."</seg>

<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that emerges in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as a Münchner district."</seg>

<seg id="51">The national union for the promotion of color above has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri's policies based on discriminatory politics and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which should come into force by 28 August 2017, asking special attention to Afro American travelers, visitors and Missourianer, as a series of fragrant, racenbased precautions occur in recent times throughout the state and here it is stated in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law from Missouri, which makes it harder to gain discrimination, as well as prosecution bodies of the state, the disproportionate effect on minorities, prompted the group, the travel warning said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have breaches of civil rights, people are going to happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are halted because of their skin color, they are collapsed or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having no gasoline at the beginning of the year and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also pointed to a recent report by the Office of Missouri office in which black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than women.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff will inform about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be willing to bring extra money or to know the relatives they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate speech in 2015, according to the latest numbers from the hate-breaking-reporting programme of the FBI, which set the state with regard to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law, which would make it harder to complain about a company because of housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACES) had issued prior warning for Texas and Arizona, having committed local peneability authorities to delay people because of immigration bodies, which will contribute to further segregation view of the ACLU to further segregation."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but in recent times the measure has been used as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Pasture project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishtaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Peter White and Kordula Kovac is able to create a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right-grabbers of the Schwendemann family met representative of the Fisheracher CDU-Locations, together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted first insight into its operation, in which he managed 55 hectares meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk, and also many young animals looked after and in five apartments guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" black-milk "is for him the alternless marketer for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste comes only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischherach, he referred to as" elementary project as "spontaneous." "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage such steep areas in a profitable business.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green space for much work, much could be edited using the engine sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he adopted the elastic operation and managed these without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if he has no bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear," "the Commune has recognised the meaning of the course of the course of the hamlet, and is happy about the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">For costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare would have to support farmers.</seg>
<seg id="81">They hope that the forestation of the areas could have been removed yet for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation," "stressed the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers do not often stand in criticism due to the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 participants have been fenced in 2013 by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"thus, the accounting area is 40 hectares, which should not be held up to at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 EUR 500 Euro, half of the leader was promoted, a quarter carried away from the village of Fischherach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"therefore, the farmers' love the farmer 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of Weipaun."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and landowners do not matter."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter Weiss was fixed:" "here the best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscaped-in-law (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of grain dresses.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the offensive of the Black-Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisites is the presence of one of the warehouses presented.</seg>
<seg id="94">"moreover, the inducting area may not be sacked up (Hangnought over 35 percent) and must thus be threatened by the forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"in 2018 we currently run the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the accounting area corresponds to 35 hectares, which are low costs of more than 112 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as well as any other, therefore, the care of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Place in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologues of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a long-lasting argument with Jim Acosta by the President of the President of the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to be fair, Miller does not get the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have suffered it punches when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but it took its importance, and in particular the meaning that it was written, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, has been added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta commuted," "I don't want to go into a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an symbol of American freedom that shines the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is knowledgeable properly, but as he formulate it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about contemporary resonance on the ascending words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only charges any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your breasts, your poor, / your beating masses, who looked after, free to breathe, / the elding waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time to see in which the" "cold waste" "was better to see on our screens."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural examination: it is indeed a conflict in the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and their friends, who took their words to place their words on the basis of their death - did so well, they made a high political action."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the ties between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem the female figure is no longer abstractions - it has received one voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she himself gives herself a very different name: mother of the exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of Johannes of the decessor for the coming from Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not an end, but rather an early Neoconservatives that bring the American flame into the umbs world:" Lady Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is said to bear the torches of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The Fackel is not supposed to enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something engraved.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely at all a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted of seeing them as they had seen from the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the Decks of ships was seen."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of men, seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever wish to recognize."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torches shall not enlighten the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">WHC 2017: Neil Black logs Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle is reminded of a time when only two rots belong to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the service director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-köping shootage contingent in the World Cup plate has a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland a little special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we figure it out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish Athlete think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish Athlets are medals of starters, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which are delivered against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 m circuit, while Eiliie Doyle was elected to the team's captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their surrender of surrender was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, regardless of whether they were deottically or where ever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the genuine feeling, the Eiliie completely naturally brought, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of silver-counter-winning, which is set to compete in their 5th world Championships in the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 rots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's largest number of athletes at the World Championship was seven who have been achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The midstream Muir leads on this path and last year has been five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another sutch, which we got after a great season, which was included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of their first World Championships that was the only other Schotte in the Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the creadors' captain said that they are" enormous pride "on the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases even with the medals and with the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"what is special about the team's surrender that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was anyway a great honour, but to know that my team colleagues have voted for me and chosen to make it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the rots that are part of the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we got.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to rise on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it was good."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will be just like a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Block of critically about Facebook: do not block you a public office if you don't have to tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our land knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans dearded George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers swallow him for all, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He crimp in the critique, secure. "</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783 Washington said Washington:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defendant him in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the rod of the governor sent the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with" Well, and? ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is an Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second-highest approval of the 50 Governor of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not an reactionary hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the guidance of its state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">"he was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and to debate its haareless head after chemotherapy, on his side."</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore the blockage of individuals who come to the side of the Governor - which is to be officially referred to as official and by employees, which are paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post (Amelia Chasse) Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governor and argued that the blockage of the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolles or spammers or hasserted people, who vibrate online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people who have been blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a business entrepreneur, and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest attributed the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Lawyroat Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not hasserted but she asked to hate."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commited politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news," wrote them in the commentary area of the news "" The Post. "" "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people is standing on the same theme, then they are disregarded by some more likely than a so-called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected people."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governor was" "concentrated spam attacks", "others would probably call" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era is easy to cut a message, by simply blocked a critics or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much more clean than in former times when you have done the same that staff have been sent to gather newspapers with critical tails, and to burn or make demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what is happening.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official that criticized about it to Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is prescribed by Twitter-users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt favors (R) also a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters smashed on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The great life live: mezzanine and clevere designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court dwelling in a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment. "</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and has sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something, that was the price of my price."</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and it was the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square-feet large apartment has been completely outdated."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a scraper layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to best use the spacious ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she instructed the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms overone another, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to consider cancer to release the predisposition.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," explained. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were remixed up, without having to ban ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just a question of building a simple platform, but to set up the steel so that he had the right height at the top or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this kind of order enabled Erfan, to place two rooms in full of one another - with a lot of extra drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic coupling window by Retrouvius over the glamoury living area down.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver, and vintage Serge Mouille lights put the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light. "</seg>
<seg id="1338">In both ends a short corridor is mirrored to take him longer.</seg>

<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamouring space, the beauty of the living room can conclude the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a wardrobe.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of" "engineering" "went in," "explains Erfan from the stahlenburg, furnized MDF door."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is now important, so when you move the door, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 sqm, an extra bedroom and improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is valued," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter, and perform a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time use high quality materials, giving the room to its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the Weekly Riodoce normally meet with twochs to check their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">"it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what is more secure: you should take their children with the office, who were the aim of an attack with pomp, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words on a panel on the front of space: opponents, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you would like to propose the reporter, names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug jewellery, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspicient to stand upon the secret list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no quiet period of violence, and while in all the land the corpses are awaiting the corpses, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took place in December 2012. 589 are standing after attack and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths among seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her publisher and her inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest error is to live in Mexico and being a journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack is felt deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows its midfinger with the word" Justice "," hanging at the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, which show his suprey face with spectacles or his typical Panamahut. "</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss about their shared subjects, trauma, its nightmare, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 a Sonder-Bundesutor's office was established to edit the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with the most thousands of Morden, which are connected each year with drug-trade and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"on Riodoce, they still insist on the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is still traitated."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting of the discussion of safety has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to wasting my time in this workshop, says he says."</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, mistrust we all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of the 15th of May Valdez took the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed just to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was forced out of his car, and 12 time was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the" "Twelten river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The fleman was driving away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to be freely accessible in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But in the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but welding.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans rearrested last year and the deportation of the United States in January was Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest Battlefield in the country, since rivalising political groups are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the graveyard is full of cultivated, two-storey Mausoleans for drug regains that are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget about a minute that there is a state of" tranquility "if only a map control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings had contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the release of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the rivaling cartels in the war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the children, suspected fans bought every specimen of the output once they were delivered to time-kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was not to force in Valdez, after confiscation of another newspaper that had been the same story to leave the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing will be seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">"he had survived, that his friends and colleagues had survived, that he would always be there."</seg>
<seg id="1845">In 2003 he was working as an experienced reporter for Norodoer than he worked together with five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism, without encounter the predote problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time, the newspaper also served a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and the sales and promotion of advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it, tough apt studies without fear of censorship, and readers have been fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce they received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living", "he said at the time of the CPJ Award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug handel in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You need to take the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what did you do in the face of so many stillness... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team did miss Valdez, the Spaak bird, who was like a port workers, the friend, who knew generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also has forced them to ask her own assumptions in question, how they do their work best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like you when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their oilable starting-and cross-debate" to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-management."</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instiners trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, keep away from it. "</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger," said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "" smell a sense that can be crushed... and then the thing with Javier has happened. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, such as he and others are considered in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, VERACRUZ, Guerrero and other states, in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt governance."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room, in which the staff of Riodoce met for security, suddenly there were no handys allowed. days previously announced that Spyware was sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen examined standing in front of the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers, who referred to the governor itself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce has taken on three main histories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an excposé on the state spending that focused on the hometown of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that conducted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Attorney, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug retailers and administrators."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter took from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader, who has been consulted by the governing Institutional Revolution Party (Pri) which dominates nearly all political planes the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several Pri-Governors were accused of high-caliper cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal bat the reporters, about previous incidents in this eatery, including one, in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman had a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before the readers had seen the Kolumba of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "" El FLACO "" because of its slender body. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was devoted to storage space for characters and stickers, which are opposed to the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Porter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration because of another journalists to the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared after three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan. "</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was detected and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is its."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country journalists have become more lucid, by having written down in organized protests of" "SOS Press" "on walking paths and construction."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is underway in Washington and tries to raise international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez accused Ramirez who spying journalists and let them return because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since then asked that she is once again divided by the government, because it is concerned that their anger has been wounded their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico organized by organised crime, by participating government officials and a" valid society "." "</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism "he wrote that journalists are not only killed by drug members, but also by politicians and security guards, with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media group "Articulo 19" took more than half of the attacks on journalists from police and officials last year.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico-minded, because they would like that you disproportionate the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the Morde have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern bordering state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Zetas bundell," I am here because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer scanner and earphones are in addition to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some stores have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern borderland Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondents Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly set up the drug cartels with a editorial article on the front page with the heading "What do you want from us?</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find jobs in exile and they still watch the streets and search for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they will be chased, as it was apparently murdered by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was in charge of four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from VERACRUZ."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who continue to stay and continue working, it is a daily dance with risk-related decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who was once poets, gives to that the drug-trading makes him frightened."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico is going to hell, and that is why I was reporter." ""</seg>

<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-fresser is the best preserved Fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed from the surrounding cliffs of the place, and decided to look more precise."</seg>
<seg id="1932">That was discovered by him Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2.500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy grounding."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinked a little with the eyes you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best surviving dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant nivores, although he is covered with an armor and resembles a changing shell, probably of meat-looking dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly tortuous dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage, in order to hide from robbery and used a shielding technology that is used as a countercircumcture, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to rule his enemies, say experts, which indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier has made the first headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have studied the wild animal and studied there Borealopelta marker on the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of the team who spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell, and an international team of scientists, the patterns and the form of scales and armours about his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the conshady, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shaded is usual, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta is far exceeding the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs has enough pressure by meat eject dinosaurs has been hunted that evolution favours the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use the convuling - think of roe deer, zebras or marriages - are much smaller and vulnerable as booty, which signalized that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong smoking-behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs roughers must have been the roundabout," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows also that the skin of the dinosaurs was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on references about his life, including his conserved gut, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, driven into a river and went out into the sea where he sunk on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta were now as warm as south fluorida today, and rivers and oceans are likely far more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preservated skin, but it remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of animal," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early roundabout.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much imagination to use it to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is asleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the circumference was a time, as a huge Theropoda, carnivorous clamp, who were on two legs, the earth had passed."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furtive ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was buried in the sea after death in the sea and in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he found in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the best-adjusted dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from the muzzle to the thigh."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inches long laces that raged by his shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"only one day after having arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis Gebal on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just gone a 18-year child, and there is still on the street," was it called there. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because no one otherwise posted on her Feed the information she closed on Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly praying on her Timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year-old which was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., killed, live to tweets."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"he posted a picture of Browns alive, which was spread on the road and would stay there four hours."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," thought Ferrell at himself. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone in order to return later in the evening to Tweets over people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos from the police band and the people, crying, and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the title:" Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">You watched a live-feed in which a policeman stand before a group of protesters with a bellish dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, cleaned a different policeman, his rifle and cried:" I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not usual," "reminded themselves of their statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we used to accustomed to and which we can name typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt Schüttelfrost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return trip and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock they took their 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets "," in the cinemas from the 11th century. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss of loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of people who live in the community and filled the streets to call answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flake and a suitable crown, came to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning, about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remembered when I have taught you when black people have to fight for that, what they believe?" remember what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson, because the police did a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take it," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">That which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You have to know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it has to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck, you experience an experience where they personally have no blecatant racism, it is no different than the next black female child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would turn her a bad service to keep them away from them."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when she arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority who was a camped place, as the activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation by Officer of Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags in front and helped to pass them to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new type of activism for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after the 9th of August, she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on Essens justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "I had no experience in organizing."</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening-demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the movie. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document", "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to Ferrell in the sense:" "do you want to document it or try to find a story that you can utilize?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of humans, often from White - in a community that benefited from their pain and strength."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as follows recently in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area, who is known for his activism as a point of deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of 'Whose Streets' in the years to Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak", "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that it comes to the movement" not around a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious candidate in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprising personal aspects of Ferrells life, how she loves himself and her wife marries."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt as naked," said Ferrel and laughed when they first saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I have understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and at the transgressor of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition Ferrells history has repeated the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement that have shaped the movie" BlacklivesMatter "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as a weaker."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, pregnant women must carry the main last of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan voted to notice, that" the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not a affirming type of action, "where Ferrell was chosen as heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who remunerated this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's not accidental although it was at the front front, because during a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman stands as much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the message cameras in Ferguson have long gone, but the racial connections between the church and the police exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on granting for 2 ½ years due to the blockage of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area which she called her home: "a Chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless it takes part in a singing and she feels obliged to this memory, since she went to the street three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "Siwahn": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves the people although it is not built long yet.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south-end of the pedestrian zone was splits since the first presentation 2009 the people in supporters and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly anything.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to say about the bit 'gallery:" "this would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" This would be real "" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "does not need a man" (Siggi Bom) or quite simply: "" Siwahn! "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents are building that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, of which also the remaining deals are concerned, fear that the pedestrian zone."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery will be planned on the property, on which the accommodation market hall is currently marketed, in the 13 direct market market."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of the construction work will be an end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Gallery-Macher want to integrate a markethall in the new building - as well as for Beda space, with possibility of sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landowners are always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like that, even during and especially after the construction of the gallery, a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">The small markethall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether direct marketed in a market hall at Galerie ansiedeln, comes to the height of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, these are likely not to be low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the purchase list in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, drone or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many stores can be empty here - some have been empty for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but as there is not even one of the weekly weekly market there, it is all the more important that we remain at least the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is not price-priced."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shopstores will be reserved in a shopping centre only by larger companies, for the dorms are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special stores there is almost no more and that which is still remaining, will probably also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with an athalle fit for me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Mainly: where is the farmhouses during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even on duration, if the bit-gallery will actually appear."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or creates the ghost bit bit earlier, to distribute all the shops of Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which stands empty, also requires no one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to encourage a real farmers market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmers' thalle it is a lot - like I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg is not place any more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market hall is broken, there will be a piece of culture disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost uncomfortable - those on cables depend on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the cuts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analytic was born a 35-year-old prison sentence, after she made publicly accepted diplomatic reports on the website WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline must be transformed into technology, computer science and art, and creing, a Transwife and debtor, whose condemnation from Barack Obama was transformed when he only had three days in his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithms of DNA, which were extracted by Manning and from the 30 portraits, such as if someone can be interpreted with these genomic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the indurent determinants of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has been openly talking about the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 because of 20 indictments, including six violations of the spy network, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through prison, their picture was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a granting, black-whie Selfie, in which Manning is visibly sitting unwell on a seat and a platypass can be associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012-project stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist, portraits of strangers, produced from forensic artifacts such as cigar mute and chewing gum, extracted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when they received an e-mail from a time to time.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while they were in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg with a press show of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea, and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated Muses became an unequal penpal, which in the course of two years participated several letters exchanged."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"you even created one of Shoili Kanungo Illustripped Comic" Suppressed Images, "which would be foreseen a future where the president would detained chevement and she was able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning release would demand for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy ignition."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump will lead to war against informants out of the government and against transgender-troops to find new, tweet possible ways to make the rigid divisions that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"called Dewey-Hagborg after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen to come out of a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery written artistic statement demanded Manning with its oversized signatures, among them (the" "i" "in their surname) is provided with a heart) an end to the" automatic defragmentation, their basis gender, racial, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence is written by thousands of Cs and GS and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hopes to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nuclotide according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of artists of the artist), such as amazing, at least in biological ways, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring with it is that our genome is not about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video-work of 2007, spurious Memories, also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above Comic Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows teams as she reappears with a free phone in the hands of the lack of discipline in the United States as King-Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they place your speech, then they have won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote me," said the artist who greeted in Philadelphia. "</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still keep gooseble when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was forestry in the Comicbook, but when they should do it, then it will be welcomed into the center of the room by the masks, of their own genomic simulacors that rods themselves like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where her genetic data groups have been written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted it to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, as the movement, which was also behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it may not be crazy, a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR), a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritified professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take up their rise seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingers."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silically that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robots accordingly according to his convictions," and thereby select everything from the eye-color of the robot over the shape of the nipples up to the type or color of his fingers. "</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still disturbing, as many robots have the" "personalities", "which would like a Stepford-woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robots allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties, which they find appealing like for example."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is still that of True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with preprogrammed personalities like" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of relterness and" "Wild Wendy" "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warmed the website of True Companion. "</seg>

<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "in the mood." ""</seg>

<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why do men then have no Roxxxy?" it is on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another shy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their development and increasing sophistication point out of something darker and deeper into our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course hold no Sex robots, and while the FRR remarked their rising popularity, they remain preliminary at the edge of consumption culture."</seg>

<seg id="2413">"and many people are not weird or irritating, until they give the free market this permission."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain reasoning that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time where the rights of women are threatened in the White House, who has prevailed to have women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">The aboutmost aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tales' ('The Report of the Magd') are not the graphical images that weaving the body and the stolen eyes but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the goal behind these sex robot is to establish a physical similarity to real women as realistic as technically feasible (though, with pornographic proportions)."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"your builders want that they feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to its" figures, "the robots are not a real female."</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet, which is rich in meat-based proteins and milk products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflamed intestinal diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition, which in the U.S. affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000, causes stomach cramps and paralysis, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the affected is usually going to avoid meat and milk products to relieve their symptoms, they found researchers at the Washingtoner University, that the essential amino acid Tryptophan by protein contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the researcher researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrolling, to make sure that damaging microbes that hide in the food not enade in the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammation, are compensated by cells, which promote tolerance and protect the body without damming tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory intestinal diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, there was found that a sort of tolerance-promoting immunisation is found in mice, which wear a certain bacterium in its branches."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microoms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more Tryptophan the mice in their food had, the more they had from this immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of the yptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal lining, if the same system also acquires with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctorate-in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immunisation that promotes tolerance as she found out that a group of studies had such cells, but another group of the same tribe but which was separate, that did not have."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they thought that the difference with the intestinal microomen of the mice, had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the stomach intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the harms of the mice became DNA sequencing, and there were six species of bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells, but without it lacking in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in an sterile environment, so that they did not find a intestinal microbiome and they were not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuthi and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria spread on the immune system, the researchers L. reuthi left in a fluid and overled small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unmature immune cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant-tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-Metabolism that is known as idol-3-acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the food feed double, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophansevalues were halved, the number of cells dropped by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us are tracked in our stomach intestinal trays."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan products from L. reuthi develop the cells in humans to develop like mice, but defects in genes in relation to Tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory intestinal diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine. "</seg>

<seg id="2882">"in the area of the presence of Stolzenau, there was a passenger on his road, so that he had to recede to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2883">They touted the Touran-driver the guides.</seg>
<seg id="2884">On the car was no harm.</seg>
<seg id="2885">"the driver of the opposite car, a Mercedes Benz, had outdated a truck and continued his drive without taking care of the traffic accident."</seg>
<seg id="2886">"according to the failure, the Mercedar-driver cannot even notice the accident at all."</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Review submitted Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report about the abnormality failures discharged Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reformmovement" We are Church "" stated after publication from the Deutsche Regensburger Bishop and today Kardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the former Benedict XVI, an excuse. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or at that time wrong assessment of processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the" "Osservatore Romano" "is said to be criticized that in the reporting of violence at Domspatzen, with" two levels. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the grips in Regensburg, no doubt that it would be punished and shameful deeds that would have to be punished and in the future; however, the" degree of medial manipulation, "such as the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historiography, and Member of the National Italian Bioethics committees."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of designate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience, is already part of the day-day experience and is preparing public opinion that is for normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you can go on to the church and that is a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"he pointed out that in her youth" "had been a quite normal pedagogical means", "in order to be done with naughty children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they are unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse there often also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrongly, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who spoke with Ratzinger the reminder" My brother of Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take George Ratzinger in protection," says Hesman, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he adds up the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is in the 440-page report, which was presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the education institution Ulrich Weber released?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s, with high Plausibility" victims of overprint, 67 Domspatzen. "</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" "to summing up, that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms physical and psychic violence have been applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially at high emotionality, the punishment was able to fall fierce for the pupils at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike numerous other defendants, that many victims coincide the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence might even combine positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview HHesman, why the final report for abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger from his opinion was relieved."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "incidents of non-violence" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a paradoxical picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one time, many students consider his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"for the other, he also appears as a choleriker and perfection that was tangible for the Öfteren when a domspatz has not brought a top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when you read the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front up to the back, one has to ask why the name of George Ratzinger thinks about it at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to him just eight sides and he is clearly acquitted by any suspicion of mediums or fellow-clerk in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"also, the expropriation of violence at the preschschule is outside his sphere of efficiency."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to raise it (if necessary, too late, or first did not take seriously enough of it."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatza school, on which he acting, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally -" "redemption", "" "Heaven" "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger produces an excellent testimony, describes it as" warm, "popular," "sincere," "knowledgeable," "knowledgeable," and "comprehensible", "who groomed the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons and" always by grapes. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about its perfectionist and its high emotionality, which also led to Wutecharts."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he was not only knitted with chairs and threw the slew, and the slaughter, and too old guys passed on to the hair or ears, he did not regret years ago, deeply deplores and excused for this."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to its honour, however, it must be said that such educators were used in the questionable time, the 1960s and the 1970s, widespread in parents like with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding techniques?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us, who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a temporal school, a state-Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what about what is actually written in this report, the placeable sexual abuse and non-violence at the pre-school, are the most certainly dredelling."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you ask yourself whether it is not more familiar with his familiarity and his role as the brother of Benedikt XVIII, that many media have just rushed to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian Pope many who have never understood it, still freezing."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report discharged Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report was reported much about the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also laid out some reluctance or lifellowship with regard to sexual abuse the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No single of the 67 victims of sexual transgrips claims to have become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dreamed with my father or mother to talk about it," said one subject to the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the true issue of the education of sexual abuse was, yet, is that most of the victims should be silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they didn't even arise such parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators yet."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the cathedral-cats have a role in terms of abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a respondent disciple formulates it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he appropriates (Georg Ratzinger) timely insight and could have been allowed to stop the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that themselves eradicated him... Bubbles intruer or clearer or even more likely, than opposite their parents, dormitory, confidence, instructors, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "that the students involved in the prior-term students and / or their environment could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore acquitted by any fellow citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be thrown out, neither prevents it or brought to the display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradicting crimes, as unfortunately it has happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media a lot of "nonviolence" in the media was to read about the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown out in the report "Walk."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and deceived was led to a huge melancholy of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"yet, this is precisely the abuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there will be clean separated: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence and, we say once, other preaches."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductor of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole foolishly pedagogy, the cases in which buys of sadistical teachers are regulated and malignited, and among them were ignited at the preschschule in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to be cured."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those who had Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger nothing to do, for he got the boys only to face when they were already at the cathedral-side school."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the same way, as most witnesses emphasize the topic" "primary school" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even 'heavenly' conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the place-in school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but there was no sadied violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" a lot of victims had seen the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence against violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at the most there is still the accusation to have blown away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts the report could only define two periods, in which it was reported from the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself just and was responsible for the walks at a school, at which he didn't want to hear and responsible (such a witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again by 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Indexing Georg Ratzinger off of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral square, which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he points out that in the pre-school, the test will continue to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in view of the danger of negative press, he received urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"it was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, when it was recently forbidden in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they opened up in a legal gray area, like each one of us knows yet to know."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate, where the person might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible border had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one cannot say, he could have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">In 1980 the examination of schools were officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair to apply the present educational standard to the then time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we were talking about the" "pitfalls of the Anachronism", "thus the danger of the past to present today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already left.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is of course not true for sexual abuse that was abominable at all times, and also not for what happened in the pre-school and violence to innocent infants, which goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">That is all quite awful and I am glad that it will finally be up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take George Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, so earchers and in hair and ears to pull were widely used in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as physical punishment was then forbidden, he is also strictly abducted."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his Regensburger Time has Georg Ratzinger took place in the conversations with you for the book" "My brother of Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of evidence also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, told his perspective, as the cathedral-cats played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not know that he carried a stricter Regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said that without this perfectionist without paying unconditional love, it would probably have been possible to form an institution of world transmitters, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went to the USA twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone one makes no great singers and ever before every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person have you experienced Georg Ratzinger for talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: from the work on the book and beyond I have come to know Georg Ratzinger really quite well and again experienced as a wonderful, humorous, humble, deep-believing and hearted people from which one could not imagine it even a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly come up with how many former domicult still today, 23 years after its embodiment, regularly contact him, visit him - he is almost blind and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not given him to this day, so that he was strictly among them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"most of the domains are grateful to him today, that he enriched her life and has provided the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, vestial teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but nevertheless a lovely disrespectful person, to which they still have a look and to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, even quite clearly: all that one throws it, are educators, which were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust one man, just because he is prominently and has an still prominent brother to make the medial scapegoats."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"that is the evil intent, which is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just released, was discharged him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the beginning-year-old man would have acquired a 93-year-old man who would have acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, and perhaps no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
