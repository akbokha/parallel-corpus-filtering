Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I always put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambig@@ uous .
&quot; I always put into drawers in drawers , or are glu@@ ed from the outside label that usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I do not have the desire , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , these things are rather straightforward . &quot;
&quot; Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only be lau@@ ghing as &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; , &quot; as it explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at best , the actress spends her time at home , pre @-@ television with loose Dut@@ t and Mexican food , is it in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; for the white man , she bring the question of the children &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs on us from August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sear@@ ched for some colleagues a little bit variety with a horseback ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Spor@@ thor@@ ns &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses reminded of their holiday , they said in the fast g@@ allo@@ p home to the food . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this speed , I am afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and so the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament wins - once again close to horses .
he was able to guide himself with his family through the complex of the AL@@ RV on a horse he didn &apos;t even stand out to photograph .
it was the first time in Aachen and with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was really convincing .
the German sports assistance handed over the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small g@@ ala g@@ ills the Gol@@ dene Spor@@ ide .
&quot; in addition , it lacks the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; Bundes@@ wehr , sil@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has ra@@ ined him .
long is the 18th pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inner of the sports pyram@@ ide .
&quot; at Aachen , he met the first prize winner of Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means me much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for she is not only awarded for spor@@ tive success but also for social engagement . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
&quot; and so , he also gave the prize money from 25,000 Euro as well . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding spor@@ tsmen , the two @-@ fold U.S. master &apos;s winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
&quot; among the excellent belong the Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ eten Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the captain Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the fountain Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard . &quot;
&quot; many of these sports cars were coming to Aachen , Germany . &quot;
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ ender Prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ mp@@ s policies in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the TT@@ P to prevent both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; unfortunately , the two US presidential system are at the EC@@ - and Energy Policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the differences between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a princi@@ pled , rather philosop@@ hical difference . &quot;
thinking about the role of the state .
the tru@@ mp will hold the doubt rather small and war@@ ns how the state of the economy can harm - with tax and regulations .
&quot; Clinton wants to put the economy to death and regul@@ ators , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it would be quite different , claims pen@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; it will be driven by regul@@ ations , and he makes for a long @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to meet , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open and need money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes would increase in the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the nuts , Tru@@ mp and Clinton will say almost wor@@ t@@ alike . &quot;
the democratic App@@ lic@@ ants announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes into the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly adher@@ ed to by the nation@@ alistic Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Republi@@ can .
so there are still partial internal discussions on the Tru@@ mp .
more evident are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal fired power plants and re @-@ drive the coal production in the USA .
&quot; oil promotion shall also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to termin@@ ate it . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to explicitly expand and asks the renewable energies with its Investment Program : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fish Trade Agreement , do both want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate the US trade - but just American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; this will then be better paid , for about Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger strike .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp is to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be down , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp is given to boost the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics hold him before , so that the household deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton concluded that at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes and their critics are saying , more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; any feared woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is one of women , who alone fl@@ ee , almost in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
&quot; each has a baby , at the most one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in the arms .
he gu@@ ed with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ es to the table .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are whis@@ per@@ ed .
they live in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Women &apos;s help .
&quot; recently , it has been officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guar@@ mann in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say , any woman who arrives there has made on their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men fl@@ ee because they are persec@@ uted because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as a hop@@ eless person to Europe . &quot;
&quot; women persu@@ aded other reasons for the escape , &quot; many ste@@ al up secre@@ tly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sory , honesty , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs go for example for a bottle of water a sexual act , is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that as soon as they fell in Germany , ir@@ re , tells us . &quot;
&quot; in addition , women are often considered inf@@ eri@@ or and worst . &quot;
&quot; this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the accomodation in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner North , are traum@@ atis@@ ed , appreci@@ ates them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not made voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the sharp@@ est is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not help you know , there will be more accommodations only for them , demands stream . &quot;
the seven District Apostles are responsible for the accommodation of refugees in Bavaria .
&quot; ask if they knew about a similar project such as in Munich in their jurisdiction , we will answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is something that exists within the governments of the governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben , women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ person of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , under@@ - and middle @-@ fran@@ ken there are in some common accommodation floors or separate homes only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
also the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for that women must be accommod@@ ated separated by men .
&quot; in a study that was published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated separately . &quot;
lack the privacy or will be accommod@@ ated by men and women may come to - constant - violence against women .
&quot; the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel in need of this protection in need , can be read at the starting point that there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has spoken around , we have a long waiting , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistance : demands for new stren@@ ght measures
&quot; in addition , the dep@@ uty @-@ member states have called for their union to appro@@ ve new labor measures in their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested its entire Council , starting from beginning of September more labour measures . &quot;
&quot; the J@@ DC said that there had been administ@@ ered by ministers , responding to the concerns relating to the contract . &quot;
&quot; assistance and medical students have agreed in July on the ref@@ us@@ al of a contract , agreed with BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected of 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the Chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persistent , &quot; which resulted in the agreement was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; in view of this the J@@ DC Board voted , to fully reject the proposed new treaty and ur@@ ges official new negotiations with all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board has made a formal application for a special meeting of BM@@ A Council to start a run program escal@@ ating work measures , beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the disputes resulted in favour of assistance in this year in sixth , the first total inci@@ dents in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A Assi@@ stance Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came to the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions , which were recommended by BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during meetings , which were still consul@@ ted before the voting by 54.@@ 000 assistance and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Minister of Mr. Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the Treaty of doctors in England would have been introduced in Germany . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : a &quot; alliance of aliens &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands , and to announce an official end of the eight months long war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin war@@ med his Turkish bac@@ on in the Golden Hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot deny the expression that Ankara wants this reconciliation in most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin made his smile , and he barely saw heat from himself , even for his back @-@ going conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , in contrast , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin , according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even be improved . &quot;
&quot; the next day he described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan as many , as if never something worse . &quot;
me seemed to indicate the opposite rather than the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin speak@@ able , sustainable cooling showed that the state of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory presentation : the down@@ ing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border with Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ angl@@ ed .
&quot; Putin shared and accused Ankara , Russia in the back . &quot;
going back was even bigger as it was by a alleged friend .
the Vet@@ r@@ ust will rebuild it becomes difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; months long , the state @-@ controlled media conducted a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed to blame the Turks for everything that blame .
&quot; they are serious officers of senior officers , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria would have benef@@ ited from the so @-@ called Islam@@ ical state . &quot;
he has disp@@ uted this veh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message that it was time to look ahead .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology of Erdo@@ gan he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could make a kind of victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire is clear on the hand . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan requires first and foremost all friends who can get after spending last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ é@@ tat almost of his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions made Turkey tough - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number is almost 90 % left .
&quot; in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are taken up again . &quot;
you are counting on a late @-@ imperial attack in the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week forec@@ ast@@ ed the state distant fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish agri@@ business are re @-@ imported . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulated it as : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry upon the West , since its response to the tried to have power over a weak response . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the continued group@@ ing over the Sn@@ ail of EU accession talks and Putin - the pi@@ ping is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the west . &quot;
the Russian state of State in Ankara won a bonus for Ankara that he sought after the tried coup d &quot; é@@ tat for elected government bodies .
&quot; this is a matter of self @-@ understand@@ ably for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ sitting fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey , one as it meant to me an analytical once described , &quot; alliance of aliens . &quot; two countries that have been viol@@ ated from the West and will now ex@@ ert themselves . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two still . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently given the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey can aid opposing parties . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after nearly three hours of the first talks on the press conference , they didn &apos;t want the issue to have been stri@@ ped . &quot;
&quot; the president of Turkey avoided it inten@@ tionally to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disp@@ ens@@ er , when NATO members reached the Russian battle jet , it certainly is better that the two Heads of State had at least one another . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland offers no longer available to customers outside Scotland
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a backpack@@ er role according to the manager of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS were associated with the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since shifted since she had almost collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; at this time , &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end @-@ consumer brand brands . &quot;
they supported international sport with millions of pounds on sponsorship by the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by up to the Wim@@ bl@@ edon winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to move more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized quarter and the IP@@ O change to Nat@@ west . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller brands for the private business , which will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a inspection tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our investment brand , as well as the brand , under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say right now that we have no global goals , but to pursue local objectives . &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with their customers .
R@@ BS has already announced that it will no longer continue his Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ability of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop the brands of brands because how do we focus on the inner ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very Cypri@@ ot three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see a lot of changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;

&quot; the first winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously played on G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , &quot; &quot; It is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; I am very happy that it is in New@@ market , because I am here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he pick up victory in Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the race @-@ race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached over 4,@@ 300 victories in a rec@@ ital career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career opportunities &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that has reached a few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distingu@@ ishes it from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma have loved fans for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie before a few weeks at Ep@@ som , that he had already gotten around 6,000 gains if he was not just a weekend and big @-@ tennis ho@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already suffered nearly 30 years of the winner that is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from flying finishes to Flying Dis@@ mo@@ unts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British flat @-@ board for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve @-@ wr@@ acking .

&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six@@ ties , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ ying its branches and to get back to his dism@@ ay . &quot;
and he is not in the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori was once said that he wants to continue with cont@@ ests up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten life year .
Russia Putin feu@@ ert Stab@@ sch@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian president Vladimir Putin made an unexpected to his Stab@@ at Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years of the narro@@ west confidence of confidence .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin arranged without giving reasons &quot; the dismis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential system . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been Chief of Ner@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 1972 was born in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tallinn , he made his conclusion at the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was a log manager and manager manager of the government . &quot;
&quot; about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; thanks for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to help her work as a state of state , and to support controls for the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked about to leave his job and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convincing the ridicul@@ ous faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious ill@@ um@@ ination .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , that was broadcast on television , both men that the St@@ ef had resign@@ ed on his own desire . &quot;
&quot; but despite the L@@ äch@@ el@@ ns for the cameras , here are only a few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power of power ?
it is currently no one .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man , who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , once again leading the Russian environmental policies - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments on Putin , who c@@ ited on the website of the Krem@@ lin , says Ivan@@ ov &quot; it is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ ain@@ ly posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential system for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin was a former member of the State Security Council of K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , as Putin was appointed chairman of the Federal Security Council ( FSB ) , which replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his representative . &quot;
&quot; as Putin speaking to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people who most trusted . &quot;
&quot; Ivan@@ ov was once believed to be President of Russia according to Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin would encounter Putin &apos;s constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post has been taken by another , close allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 billion US project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the north deck of the que@@ en@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four gener@@ als of the &quot; ceiling brack@@ et , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the square section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 ton .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 guns . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the £ 1,35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017 . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Keit@@ h Brown , the construction site took a visit today and was one of the first that went from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineers of a truly ep@@ ic degree , with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel , which alone was used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the tear between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bri@@ de@@ ous activity , which require extremely precise tolerance for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total rolls are at their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks is today in Ros@@ y@@ th a Bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to his place . &quot;
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first lock represents a significant milestone in each gan@@ try project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the cl@@ asp is tr@@ end@@ setting and low @-@ mining .
&quot; after installing the last street , and its connection with the northern part of the northern deck , we had to so@@ ak the still existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was achieved by drag@@ ging the northern en@@ unci@@ ation bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
&quot; massi@@ vely , as the vi@@ adu@@ ct 222 meters long is , about 6,000 tons weighs and at a slope of approximately 3 % had to be pulled up . &quot;
&quot; there the toler@@ ances , because the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , tiny - on each side they rested only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men still have good luck in life

who builds sea@@ wi@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green my : investors are to be taken much stronger in the future .
how do you respond to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick two cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; at the next session . &quot;
&quot; however , war is programmed . &quot;
&quot; first of all , it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing .
&quot; SPD member of Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree to the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , must be in future 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be developed in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big dispute in the Town Hall is however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; how do you work with investors to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of apartments building as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban residential construction programme , which will cost millions of costs and will have to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the political groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the Left still wants to raise tough@@ ness for investors .
&quot; regardless of what viol@@ a , b@@ ail a tigh@@ tening of the situation in the living @-@ market . &quot;
&quot; the scope of action is implemented , which will provide additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
&quot; however , the program is not completely absent : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built in any case . &quot;
&quot; but how does one compar@@ es the loss of other approximately 1300 @-@ cheap apartments , whose funding will run out over the next few years ? &quot;
it will be 500 apartments alone up to the year 2020 .
&quot; to avoid this , the planning @-@ policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought from the city now . &quot;
&quot; moreover , we would have to be thought to get back to the price tag again . &quot;
this is possible in the Western city .
in one fell s@@ ails the problem solve .
in the west @-@ town the dates run for the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price of cheap apartments .
only : this will not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; for example , the number of social housing in the west city has declined dramatically , from the goal of the so @-@ called mixing @-@ mixture . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social weak in just a few parts will no longer be there . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; President of the Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must take into the boat . &quot;
I have concentrated on more construction sites for family @-@ family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that yet another compromise can be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world is changing .
&quot; teenagers and child for playing no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time outdoors , to star@@ ing to screens , has been lam@@ ented in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Po@@ k@@ emon Go it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa , and become more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was created on the characters , which were first created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ s ( later created a drawing series , game cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop @-@ culture sank in the interest before the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postp@@ oned by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more user as Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players take their smartphones outside and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons who will be followed with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a Screens@@ hot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
&quot; one generation who played the game as she was still younger , closed the W@@ ahn and sp@@ rang for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that will leave the &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; person each day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ og@@ ram , an app for Apple Watch , the 35.@@ 000 users revised , distributed within two days following the launch of the game , the number of people followed , by 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring about 30 minutes to take &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active &quot; &quot; every day , because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the meaning of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport , reduces its chances to work on cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful to Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is , that it brings people to do something outdoors that make them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people even join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ ur@@ fs game that must always complain about something .
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
it has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps would be able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its rides and the use of time will be revealed .
&quot; due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite Apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist into the real world and to help many people on hunting are more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

on gan@@ zer line brilliant .
and now finally Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ erin .
the 19 @-@ year old Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the multi @-@ year title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
its total result of 6@@ 2.1 was clearly found in front of the silver medal winner and the final Five &quot; Mann@@ en@@ kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze @-@ winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es , on the sul@@ p@@ sich@@ ord , during the Sing@@ ing battle of women in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Americans , who win a multi @-@ war title and in total the fifth , while they are bound to be their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; it broke out in tears , as their final result was shown and their long journey at this moment was an end . &quot;
&quot; this success presents them in the same league as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years their sports species , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress of 1984 Mary Lou rescue on her said she was &quot; the best gymn@@ ast in that I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was a final examination in Brazil , a competition which was not so very between Bil@@ es and the rest of the Ath@@ l@@ ete , but rather between her and a burden of excessive expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace the gold and silver in the single @-@ contest of women in the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while they were reti@@ ring at the far@@ ewell party who were reti@@ ring in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a record sign . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es consisted , during their long way on the top , never plan the future , this is not really true . &quot;
a part of their Boden@@ exercises - which contain its typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit home at the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
it is not a coincidence .
&quot; adopted this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school influ@@ enza in the gym , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it was no longer lost since the summer of 2013 , a winning series , which will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina did easily led through two rotating , du@@ des the picture . &quot;
sul@@ p@@ sich@@ ord and bu@@ dent@@ es - in which it keeps the World Cup title - lau@@ ded .
they returned again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the sul@@ p@@ sich@@ ord again - and sat on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
&quot; R@@ ais@@ man embr@@ aced them sof@@ tly when she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ ish - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow on Bil@@ es sh@@ iny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that once used it once in its collection play . &quot;
&quot; the performance R@@ ais@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when they fought for the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ r@@ ake in Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capitalists had been called by the Americans &quot; &quot; gran@@ ny &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her soil exercise , she cast the audience of the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dubi@@ ous . &quot;

police : 3 victims in mass diar@@ rho@@ ea in the music @-@ shot in the car
&quot; according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl were shot in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial settlement of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpetrators brought eight shots from a hand@@ shake @-@ weapon while he stood on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another vehicle , is to read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a smo@@ ker , since the att@@ acker did not participate the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting broke out , a closer look on whether it is connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , predominantly in His@@ panic residen@@ ces were killed in nine months in nine attacks seven people and two more wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , an subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ ll@@ ac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators wei@@ gh@@ ed the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and have been committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized because of their injury and died later . &quot;
&quot; Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness shared the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which rose up to an empty pick@@ up Truck for half an hour before the triple murder and from which it is assumed that it was the work of the serial growth . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ances and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as frag@@ ments from the engine space .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of its anti@@ quity has Ed@@ mund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto did not know during their pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I managed not . &quot;
I am not doing that .
I did not let myself be left .
&quot; what does not matter at all -- of course , one has left it on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her husband has been informed that Ed@@ mund was able to see them under circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ote him to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer to that was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a hearing .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit or sit down to his third year of life and he cannot speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and bicycle ride .
he also likes to play with his two brothers and sing .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the string , which Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please thought me something &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language with , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical drawing language -- it tells them . Ed@@ mund has invented a few signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as mas@@ ons or the c@@ avi@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it is influenced by the life of the c@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is reminded of the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
&quot; I had no longer asked for the progn@@ osis since a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can truly say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants that were caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

&quot; the boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old which is found in a critical state , shot up , reports the transm@@ itter . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police exactly whether among one of the last men of the perpetrators could be .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it seems to be a crus@@ ade between several guns .
&quot; Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ances for Stur@@ m@@ wo@@ e , which have been trac@@ ed to various stub@@ bor@@ es , s@@ wir@@ es the Tat@@ ry . &quot;
it seems that it is clear to a long @-@ lasting struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the road , found himself sle@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have been here several armed fighters to have been actively involved , &quot; the police officer p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles met in the area .
there was no strongh@@ olds and the police are currently checking reports according to the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year girl hit the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ end .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine among the women &apos;s oly@@ mp@@ i@@ hood and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been with every summer oly@@ mp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and second , this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , which inspir@@ ational for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this crew , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ oli@@ kin , makes it very proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has paved the black and ugly female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female tur@@ tle .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner and America during the last Olympic Games .
&quot; now the world was able to be witness to the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez as she was unexpected , but most master@@ ful g@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , who won gold for women in an individual appeal for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are witness@@ ing the tip of this sport , but you do not see the classes in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic Team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympics are only four tur@@ ner@@ ers in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like exercising a more expensive sport is and Tur@@ ner will primarily be maintained primarily in private trainers , which will be maintained for training - interior , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their Tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be desired as desired . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ around lie in af@@ flu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner will receive their whole training , and this is for families a great and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer from Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ees of Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they have begun with the gymn@@ as@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; we need to be inspired to the municipalities au@@ n countless , young girls , which are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a high performance and easy accessible exercising . &quot;
I was founded my gym for 20 years .
&quot; with my events , we have offered free and affordable turbul@@ ences in Harlem for over 15,000 people ( above all black and h@@ is@@ panic ) offered and national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality tur@@ keys that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great oly@@ mp@@ ic sport .
&quot; exercising develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and certainty for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for educational and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this crew , who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this genuine representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the oly@@ mp@@ ic cre@@ tory and thank you , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
Assi@@ stance would like to organize further strikes after Jerem@@ y H@@ unts suggestion was rejected .
&quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of a reform contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37.@@ 000 assistance super@@ visory boards , which voted against him . &quot;
&quot; in July hunt had un@@ vei@@ led the plans to introduce the contract forced , and said that the N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay to the staff and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance personnel should receive a new contract , including changes to night and weekend ties to improve care of the watch . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ sten@@ au shared last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance assistance to the proposed treaty , particularly , that it will heal the current occupancy crisis and administ@@ ering it to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; for just eight weeks , who still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract must be made progress and time is running out . &quot;
efforts by BM@@ A to solve any dispute through talks may take part in the government to engage themselves and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; it was that of a promise that Jerem@@ y hunt for the last month , that his door would ever be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt has to act now , to raise the penetration and the worries of assistance . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do this , it is clearly stated the assistance were made clear that they are prepared to perform further working measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine oper@@ ations and 100,000 appointments , since n@@ urses and specialists were involved to provide doctors on the strike chain . &quot;
the Minister had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes made by adop@@ ting the reform@@ ist contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ I would like to pay a better week@@ pay for the 54.@@ 000 assistance personnel , which shall be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General director of the N@@ HS employee , asked for the assistance to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working measures do not reach anything of the only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families only concerns , emergency and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the Committee of the Assi@@ stance and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries to respond positively to concerns regarding the tut@@ el@@ age and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses and the gender issue , training , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training holiday and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
&quot; the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine , which can reduce heart attack &quot;
thousands of heart @-@ colour patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after administ@@ ered by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for an extended period of time .
the German@@ ic medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke if or another heart attack . &quot;
&quot; the regul@@ ator authority of the N@@ HS has recommended for a long time , in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems . &quot;
&quot; the regul@@ ator authority of the N@@ HS has recommended for a long time , in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems . &quot;
&quot; some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stroke are caused by accumul@@ ations of fatty material in the arter@@ ies .
&quot; if the t@@ ag breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood flow is rede@@ emed , it can flow through blood flow and c@@ ops the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to another . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the Chamber of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces that risk by making the formation of blood pressure un@@ prob@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the presentation &apos;s throw from nice , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with an twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the nice Ministry of Health prevention , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons that suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a considerable negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attack and stroke affects men who had already a heart attack .
&quot; due to a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are glad that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood risks - is limited to a period of up to three years . the conduc@@ tivity does not recommend any treatment that goes beyond that time period .
culture of Political Cor@@ or@@ ness makes it flour@@ ishing in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was last year at the resign@@ ation of a government report because of corruption from the office .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to wi@@ dened the widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities will be w@@ ingly ignored as a crus@@ hing ist report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es touches verbal police , elec@@ torate and Rath@@ houses used to have evidence of elec@@ toral abuse due to &quot; over@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ cal and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and Communist government , which is now a antagon@@ ism , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be as bad as that the police should be allowed to set off str@@ aps outside of elec@@ toral cables to protect sm@@ ug@@ ging voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should take a credit card in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must only call its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not removing tin@@ ent ink on the fingers of a person if they give up their elec@@ toral voice to prevent someone twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal law and decisions on non @-@ official com@@ it@@ ees or working groups .
&quot; this not only for elec@@ toral positions , but should also the municipal government before the wider cor@@ rup@@ tive and financial fraud culture that goes with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Leg@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special option was decided that the am@@ using Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be revealed to the corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ si@@ sted the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and that he would have put his critics with r@@ attle and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is supposed to have guided his campaign on the basis , that it is the rel@@ ig@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which a person cho@@ oses another one than anyone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of sc@@ am throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed particularly alar@@ ming to frau@@ dul@@ ent brief@@ cases - when the older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , de@@ formed , made several recommendations to dismis@@ s the elec@@ toral system , including the guides from out to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in its report it says : &quot; &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercis@@ ed , especially women and young people in order to vote according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ical or ban@@ chen@@ glad@@ ish background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions such as such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ cal and religion would have ignored .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to s@@ lan@@ der the system , including the ban , that political activists , and op@@ tionally available to stop &quot; El@@ ection &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration insp@@ ections to avoid that the elec@@ toral directory is used to Immig@@ ration and Social @-@ lists . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your credit card .
&quot; not remote ink on the finger of a person use , once they gave their voice to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
systematic det@@ ections on the nationality of a person perform to ensure that they are op@@ tionally eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for automatic set @-@ selection .
pro@@ hibition that political activists can edit complete brief@@ ing and envel@@ opes of letters .
the police will give the authority to set up barriers to election stations .
&quot; a legislative change , which facilit@@ ates an indic@@ t@@ ment because of inti@@ mid@@ ation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Law Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photographer offered in elec@@ toral stations .
&quot; demand , that only English in the elec@@ toral stations must be used ( except Wales ) . &quot;
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees usually push that voters go alone into the ballo@@ t .
&quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets fall no criminal off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ al Court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for the im@@ it@@ ary of corrupt and illegal practices as unt@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was guilty on the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also cri@@ tici@@ zed the most effective &quot; ab@@ h@@ ac@@ compli@@ ment &quot; of the licensed registr@@ ations of the Town .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is known as the Mother of parli@@ aments , a proud heritage , but the worrying and covered prop@@ ag@@ ation of elec@@ toral schools and leu@@ g@@ ation of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

&quot; except for its predecessor , many people on the Internet are presenting many people on the internet , such as a certain ar@@ cher of the Twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison has contributed a crash on Twitter after having pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star Un@@ hei@@ ly similar . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher was given the ins@@ anity of the social media with and gave him to hear that he has already been hearing for his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;

&quot; he is a well @-@ looking guy , so I do this as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly step into the center : the simil@@ arity between the British gas spr@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .

&quot; further prolonged comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ h , who has similar serious ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;

&quot; the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone was off , when he can finish off his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200@@ sqm . &quot;

the criticism against Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard to put him at speech
&quot; Twitter users did not return as they heard , like uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was &quot;

&quot; you re@@ represented the C@@ BC and Canada , and lets us look like R@@ assi@@ sts . # mentioned . &quot;
&quot; short time later exc@@ used Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast , live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; We are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming pool . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation , we are sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ olog@@ ised at the end of more than 90 times at the people who responded to the Bem@@ er@@ kt via Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ators Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on behalf of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology on more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments made by Mac@@ Donald
the network ap@@ olog@@ ised quickly and gave us a message .
&quot; we sincerely regret that these statements were made , and that it was made possible that it will be broadcast . &quot;
we stayed there yesterday night with our spect@@ ators on show and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in social media exc@@ used .
&quot; to clarify one clarify , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments referred to the performance of the swimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were un@@ reasonable and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . Byr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , Mac@@ Donald exc@@ used in the show and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it is not intended as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to forgive me for the comment I did after the Frau@@ ensch@@ w@@ staff@@ el in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , to ap@@ olog@@ ise he said . &quot;

buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ trag@@ ed about woman who tasted in the middle of the shop ling@@ erie
&quot; the buyer did not know where to see , when a woman moved her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ p@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , they mu@@ st@@ ed as she looked out , she moved out and placed them back to the shelf . &quot;
she moved on and tasted four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone in which the woman tasted the under@@ p@@ ants before they put them back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ wear , she arose and the shop left without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; the people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; in the middle of the schedule , she took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants out of the base , moved her own ti@@ ghts and p@@ ants , and tasted them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even tried to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she was simply there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each star@@ vation when they moved the under@@ p@@ ants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it down , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three other under@@ p@@ ants before she finally decided that her fell s@@ ain@@ ted and sh@@ out again .
&quot; it did not seem to disturbing that they were watching someone , or about the person who would buy sub @-@ p@@ ants , who had tried it . &quot;
&quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; How to think that someone would take shelter with them who had a different person and which were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to draw the clothing pieces from the sale , after they went - what is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants to go home and find out that another woman had begun and again and were not washed away .
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident occurring on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make him a bit safer .
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to walk with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to rot@@ ate for your pre@@ dator . &quot;
&quot; when you move from the back , you should turn to yourself as a First , so that you can see your att@@ acker and follow from the foot@@ line , &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the gun then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then suggest him so@@ w with the knee into the body and rot@@ ate , while the ag@@ gres@@ sor pre@@ y , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move back@@ wards while taking the weapon to him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers , which approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shaving line , grab the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; shift at the same time the weight of the gun and hit the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of its handle before it move back@@ wards and set the weapon to it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that it &apos;s a smo@@ ker at the safest , your money is too over@@ rich - unless you &apos;re a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
Rei@@ d@@ Ian W@@ right scrap@@ es for a travel guide to the narro@@ wer locations of Europe
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ str@@ ates its immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex a serious examination - by doing some of the narro@@ wer and ek@@ el@@ est places in Europe .
&quot; moder@@ ator and travel chief Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ch@@ ased his part on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ c@@ adi@@ l@@ ly Circus , a dishwasher and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before the check @-@ up of each object , he used an L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he will get . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was recorded under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength . &quot;
&quot; the thought , to reject the r@@ ins@@ b of a draw toil@@ ette that was already used by thousands of others , but actually are in a kitchen sink more poor bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria , as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he put it , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine , coming through the world and having a peculi@@ ar , as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations up to dish@@ wash@@ ers of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; he told me : &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and sl@@ ate water . &quot;
in the film he was fair to his reputation in any case .
the only thing he deri@@ ded was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its trial @-@ line showed an L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ num from over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ m is fresh@@ ly woven hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to reject after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ is@@ cent over 4000 units were , while fresh@@ ly saw hands less than 60 . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the movie &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; that comes the worst of what I have mat@@ ured in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing short of dirt than that !
I will see nothing here because it is here inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products . &quot;
&quot; the company contains Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o W@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; we really wanted the consumer to offer something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; we led mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by , which we ended , that we said &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary this allows us to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala that resulted in the direction of the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had learned some of the things which I have reli@@ ed to him , like the ek@@ el@@ ous Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , things were simpler , when it was simpler to bring Ian Gillan , she anz@@ ul@@ ously and others , with which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in one of Vali@@ o conducted survey from the year 2015 , 84 percent of all surv@@ ey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they are at least stored occasionally , the lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social Family destroy the social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a aso@@ und family left their social apartment after a delay in a height of £ 50,000 because it had wre@@ cked her neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skelet@@ on and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were sent after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were rolled out from their property , sho@@ cked the property established in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; walls Co@@ w holes on , wooden sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s were ri@@ pped up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor scattered and gr@@ aff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were res@@ trained and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they feared that the apartment may no longer be repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare , and I think people will not have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is probably considered not as beautiful part Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and her reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had put the family , tr@@ ams with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ers , drugs , and excessive scre@@ ams , sc@@ ents and cur@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was placed on the contract , got in June an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which under circumstances will be demol@@ ished , old gar@@ bage was found &quot;
&quot; there were tr@@ aded in the estate , in which in the past drugs were tr@@ aded , the wooden sh@@ ri@@ mp &quot;
neighbours explained that they had to fight them on the streets and had to be inv@@ oked by the police regularly
Corn@@ wall Housing Com@@ ed her and their partners this week for@@ ested by the estate after giving them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to get voluntarily sur@@ rendered .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation were che@@ ated by ligh@@ tened neighbours who told her life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; You agreed to anyone . &quot;
we lived for 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times we have the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood on because it was so quiet - that we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would deny the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , which the police have been called for regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
on the over@@ grown side of the over@@ head were tr@@ ash and old toys dis@@ car@@ ded
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it was administ@@ ered for the ten@@ ant to take all responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ ine is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing is taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , as the behavior was extremely difficult and had to leave their actions for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have mu@@ te to us and gave us the information provided . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neighbours and giving the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they all have more than 20 . &quot;

workers of household administration are now going to have sor@@ c@@ ind dreams that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis , as well as scales , par@@ ishes and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine @-@ sentence after it had been guilty of the possession of a dro@@ ge of class B into trade @-@ class knowledge .
&quot; they asser@@ ted that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don was , who died at a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after they were without tro@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and their partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the house @-@ walls of the house were awarded with gr@@ aff@@ iti .
the police says that they will be ten@@ ant to do ten@@ ant who do not keep themselves to the house .
Angela C@@ row shared by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared with that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ment is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house order .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can accept self @-@ alleg@@ ations , as well as those who were damaged by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior who continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; in the orchestr@@ al , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix that is the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have am@@ ber music in our blood !
in this stage st@@ aging plays Bart@@ oli an older bu@@ d Maria .
&quot; she is thinking with melanchol@@ y in her lovers with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so she is clever , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , which I was said to be Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; lau@@ ghing Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer , &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormously sive man .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his bub@@ bles , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , this is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip WM . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; up to date : &quot; in this piece , it is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;

&quot; they are the same issues , and they are just as expres@@ sive as it was at that time . &quot;
59 years later the play is still relevant .

&quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; &quot; some hundreds of thousand &quot; &quot; believes in the bond of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the tough proceeding from the Turkish president Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community Germany is expecting a mass evasion to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice , I spent with tens of thousands of thousands of people from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime fought the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the Chief Executive Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government was educated by cur@@ bur@@ ns before months ago , were 50@@ 0.000 Kurds in Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the contrac@@ ted coup are still sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ ing@@ ethnic Turks added .
many will want to start in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state which himself depri@@ ves refugees in own country of refugees , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the association sh@@ aded the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ den@@ cities . &quot;
in order to allow Erdo@@ gan the exit to the remaining Kurds to increase .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or sold in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; the government called for the German government , as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot;
even in Germany there is a &quot; wit@@ ch@@ asing hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
for the first time I did not feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement fears also the escape of many Turks .
&quot; more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the brand@@ ing as man@@ ure pend@@ ant destroyed teachers and other acade@@ mi@@ sts the professional existence .

&quot; as the newspaper reported on appeal to numbers of the Federal Ministry of Ministry , the Turks already set before the coup , were the largest group of legitimate legitimate aspir@@ ation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; from June 30th , this was 11.@@ 386 people and thus just under 29 percent of all accepted ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
this survey will not be found before war , poverty or de@@ ath@@ less@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers under the Basic Law are exclusively politically , i.e. by national side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : to go there where it w@@ eh@@ n
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing of the summer election with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia may not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; 2021 will not return the country @-@ day choice directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for stupid as so far , it is not : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ sea @-@ fighting - that puts itself . &quot;
&quot; the locals , which are to be convinced by the workers , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; most of the holi@@ day@@ makers who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are no locals , so do not choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters hanging up , fl@@ ash@@ ons , fl@@ yers and the end of votes count that are only lab@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; up to 4 September 2016 , the elec@@ toral and last F@@ eri@@ day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to let go over again at the people at Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot stage , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his position . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clear in surveys behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; thri@@ lling , how strongly new@@ com@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ sty dust . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous campaign , one sees from his grand@@ children . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , spread ses and chat a little with the people , just as it did its legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the guilt of the flo@@ wering of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; We created &quot; to rise up the rise of the right @-@ sp@@ op@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the best office . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ U with its top @-@ channel data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz Caf@@ fier , has already experienced how it is when you make at the wrong time at the right place of choice . &quot;
she invited her ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to large customer groups ; Merkel ( German Bundestag ) is in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group was not , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority of other Länder , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it is a shame to hear from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel once again . &quot;
otherwise the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U is completely om@@ itted on the usual elec@@ toral campaign@@ ing on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and air balloon .
&quot; that , so says co , plays only a &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union too has noticed that it is cru@@ m@@ bling on the land , that she has to str@@ ate very harsh to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the sides of the country hardly any present . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election , Kok@@ ert on his co @-@ ordination : &quot; you have to go there , where there are w@@ ager , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden W@@ ed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is on the game , Sell@@ ar@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind the CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD was still clear up at 35.@@ 6 percent prior to the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small@@ part@@ ei with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should lead the leap into the land@@ day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue from the holiday @-@ need and lay their elec@@ toral election in the internet .
&quot; online El@@ ections , &quot; he called the president of Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , there is a green campaign for sp@@ ur@@ ging search for native stimulation among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top @-@ did@@ acy , has just arrived with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ ische seas and still finds it beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; election in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Restau@@ ration : teachers suffer from blocking
&quot; on the quick@@ ness , with which the B 27 is re@@ treated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am and only around 8@@ pm , there are always praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything pretty scar@@ ce , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet @-@ gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no hiding place .
&quot; the construction site could be released at the end of the weekend , to the half @-@ time planning after the south , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed will also be praised for the construction persons responsible for the construction persons , e.g. when it comes to the establishment of accommodation depart@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site started on Monday to the south and the blocking of the asp@@ halt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has also been lifted , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has to be relaxed within the place . &quot;
the citizens can now be rus@@ hed by O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the so@@ aking through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; says the Vice Chairman of the Secretary General Manager of the Vice President Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ h@@ ubs , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many of the lighter paths were examined and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what this led to maneu@@ ver yourself in residential areas in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed b@@ umps are not respected , the assembly is increasingly requested to sing the measuring vehicles from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable crossing , &quot; says King , who himself was on location even on the spot . &quot;
there have been two to three per minute now .
the quick@@ est was with 77 km kilometers at the speed @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , it has become more quiet . &quot;
&quot; for the busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the road is open again . &quot;
we do not like to look into the maps .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ re@@ cl@@ amation has led to them at sales revenue , everybody makes you ask . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customers &quot; so for other companies , for whom the refurb@@ ishment has little consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; very slight drop &quot; , &quot; but there is also a fact that of course , is missing . &quot;
the strongest cat@@ ch@@ elt are the Local along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all guest facilities have made it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they l@@ acked the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ sel@@ eil . &quot;
we need to be happy for each Euro turnover .
&quot; the sales figures are based on &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tr@@ ens@@ ation took its operation at two years .
half of his staff have to release them .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismis@@ sed the policy differently .
&quot; instead , the President Jörg Schmidt has on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial balance , with the reference , the guest house benef@@ ited from the advantages of the location at the B 27 Now now also influences the dis@@ advantages that arise by the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other country circles where something is managed .
G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant is forward .
&quot; after all , the family run has been settled since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ arities now look at now because of complicated traffic @-@ driven traffic , it can be understood . &quot;
&quot; if one cannot drive down , it is also quite different . &quot;
&quot; that his tri@@ bal climate change back after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , it has no doubt about it . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and bir@@ d@@ oll , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 @-@ building work on its cli@@ ent@@ ele for the greatest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long@@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , which is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the counter @-@ terrorism , the name of the counter @-@ terrorism is constantly being rob@@ bed . &quot;
after the recent attacks &apos;s interior minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a big safety package .
but what has a d@@ ul@@ atory status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ally say about it all ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Recon@@ c@@ iler .
&quot; all of his proposals are to be &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new safety package . &quot;
they are calling for anyone .
&quot; other , further points would be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I am too busy too .
&quot; as Interior , however , be well located at the results and at a &quot; toler@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; according to recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , there has been a little time hidden after the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , before it presented its conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but this is now the more extensive .
&quot; a lot has already been announced , it hur@@ ries : that a new security authority is to take care of the ch@@ acking communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines to air passenger data and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for safety authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; to the part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is launching a second starting point for proposals which have so far failed to do with the SPD : he wants to pose symptom @-@ fri@@ ction for terrorist groups , and jiha@@ dists with double citizenship in the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; spati@@ ally the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; he nonetheless consider this for the most reasonable and demanding nothing , which at the body of the body did not have any chances . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they partly have it in himself : he plans quick @-@ shift for deport@@ ation and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people before deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees , specifically to be fet@@ ched into the country , should be previously open their smartphones and open social media accounts for a safety review . &quot;
&quot; in case of ex@@ ul@@ ing asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about such that commit crimes , or remove their papers to wear their identity . &quot;
a lot of them is political and legal .
some also works un@@ balanced and can be asked questions openly .
&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tissue , for example - raises the question : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not possible to address the attacks by Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg refugees . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a lot of people are worried about the high refugee concerns about safety . &quot;
and things that the people are deeply engaged in the election times could not be depl@@ ored even in times of election times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the insurance is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elec@@ toral campaigns . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and SPD can therefore increasingly take a stand on the subject of inner security . &quot;
in the past few days there were high differences between the two parties .
&quot; only a decisive dispute over the equipment of the federal police , then via a safety @-@ policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Interior , who also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also here to conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
&quot; from a return of the one @-@ pass , he doesn &apos;t consider anything . &quot;
we have documented the discussion in Germany .
&quot; new to keep up , be not useful . &quot;
and at a Bur@@ ka ban it has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional in all corners , and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ er , has to show itself first . &quot;
there is some dr@@ in which could provide a row .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently attemp@@ ting to benefit from the subject of inner security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes only sometimes careful talking and says , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to improving security . &quot;
yet another Volkswagen has yet to be offered .
despite diesel @-@ sk@@ and@@ als the exp@@ ir@@ ation pay worldwide .
but not in all markets it is running round .
in the back action there is ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e about a concept .
Volkswagen starts at the exp@@ eci@@ es in the second half @-@ year .
&quot; of Europe &apos;s largest motor@@ bike can be seen in the past year despite the diesel affair , thanks to its many brands and some good continued markets further into a plus . &quot;
&quot; however , in July the core @-@ brand VW , especially in Western Europe and is thus again res@@ ili@@ ent again the total sales , as that were noted in the D@@ ax company . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the brand VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe , only in Western Europe , to China the second most important market , sales cuts down 14 per cent below the previous year . &quot;
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ten the transmission around almost a Six@@ th .
&quot; brand Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July , above all on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it was commissioned in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; besides the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um was deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , where the car@@ bure@@ tors first escal@@ ate , there is also a minus to book . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; overall , the mainly affected Hau@@ ke of the Nieder@@ sachsen is further far from diesel by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months just a supplier of 0.7 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles is at home . &quot;
consolidated tri@@ eb@@ sch@@ ef Fred Kap@@ pler was able to proceed with Fred Kap@@ pler from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had been t@@ amper@@ ed with a software t@@ attered .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW around 2.5 million vehicles is calling for change in workshops . &quot;
in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW , that the re@@ modeling of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the change over the vehicles , there are no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power . &quot;
&quot; the bus service to the customer after conversion a &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; certificate , but I am not of a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in business travel . &quot;
reason are legal enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; focus &quot; &quot; had reported Volkswagen to present his German customers now a guarantee for setting up diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW @-@ representative in the Federal Ministry of Defence .
from the Ministry of Education was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has made the support of my In@@ quiry Commission , and the KBA in full . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; the Federal Minister of Mr. Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor@@ performance after the retro@@ fitting will not take place , and all the typically @-@ enabled vehicle levels have been unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not how it was in business travel . &quot;
&quot; the extensive term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; allows Volkswagen to get the possibility that customers come to a workshop for example a half year after conversion , and this can lead to the new software even if the damage does nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the customer interests , it is important to avoid that there are any other damage caused by any other damages , which at all occurs with the failure of possible warran@@ ties , as it was meant . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich as@@ parag@@ us in the future as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; banking officer Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only a few customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ day bank accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Bundes@@ verband German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal : normal as@@ parag@@ us should not fear , for their as@@ parag@@ us imp@@ unity . &quot;
&quot; wareh@@ ouses banks make money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay for 0.@@ 4 per cent criminal . &quot;
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ monetary accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs in the future is 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has fallen around 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to another and cannot be able to classi@@ fy it . &quot;
&quot; they are due to me on the bank account and cause 0.3 percent costs , &quot; &quot; said the chief manager . &quot;
I cannot lay down for each million 4000 Euro .
the cost will now give him further to the urs@@ ach@@ er@@ ation principle .
&quot; when it is easy to allow the cash into the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank , much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced &quot; already four survi@@ vor@@ es , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and exchanged on other assets .
only a few hi@@ ked to other banks off .
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria said , &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing significant costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry alone , be &quot; &quot; economic permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for bank performance , credit cards or credit transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ thouse for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gia Volks@@ und and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with her Skat@@ bank branch 2014 Head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , captain &apos;s leader of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private clients have to pay for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; a Cli@@ ent@@ el , which is equipped with a wealth of abundant . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , if it is free of charge . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 was founded in 1911 , founded in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region well known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ oper@@ ative association of Bavaria are currently no further banks known , which comp@@ ute an out@@ let for deposits of private clients , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Bundes@@ Federation of German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ banks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is hard and it dro@@ ver the emig@@ ration of competition to the competition .
the customers in Germany will not let themselves fallen in the width .
destination plates : who does not buy sil@@ plates ?
deser@@ ted men middle aged records .
&quot; before you go out to the commentary box to so@@ wing it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ coll@@ aged men @-@ aged men with r@@ ust insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multip@@ lication of sound plates is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who wish to welcome the curiosity of physical objects but to be attributed to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are all predic@@ ting after between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer .
&quot; it is also not a hor@@ des through hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older record res@@ ti@@ sts keep their feelings more likely to spend ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) , and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) . &quot;
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog is a news report on television , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o bad , a modest crus@@ ade to wear and wild si@@ lo@@ ere before I ste@@ eping , my hands hold and somewhat determin@@ ate how : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ hos is slowly located to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling up the buildings in which once independent seller located - are still a handful of fantastic turn@@ tables . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera to the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and stu@@ d by watching .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I made by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : eight men middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , probably about the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , question I ? &quot;
&quot; I already appreciate it , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; this sound plates , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by email , I am not followed by him ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : he is now able to buy records as they appeared and once again to buy items that he sold , when he was young and bank@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; many things that I buy , are published from the late six@@ ties , early 70@@ s , which was published , when I was 11 or 12 . things that I probably was anything to young to buy it , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who are buying plates , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t eat much . &quot;
this is my push @-@ buttons .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who meet the You@@ Go@@ v Profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people that will be influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and let themselves be led to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually got around 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , sell now their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of trail@@ ers of the record @-@ revised of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica , to recognize that record stores provides a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the contact @-@ contact payment system . &quot;
some record @-@ fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of trusted sil@@ atten@@ d@@ ants from objects to f@@ aint h@@ it@@ ative che@@ es@@ hips .
&quot; I think , sometimes it may be the feeding of a void or the property of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is true with me as collectors so and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to get mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; a staff of a record stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people bought a record , they have not yet heard yet . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy one record , not record a record player . &quot;
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while using a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came only here purely and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ cal@@ f record , so that I can put it into the shelf . &quot;
this is not a great percentage but it definitely happens .
&quot; more produ@@ cri@@ tically , less music cl@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; we have people , who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who only slow to come . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience , than I would go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women middle ages . &quot;
&quot; even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the pre @-@ standing shops - Wild Be@@ asts New Wor@@ ds and sex@@ ters Pop instead of experimental jazz cho@@ oses among the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but nag@@ ging psychological trau@@ mat@@ a are hard @-@ adjustable when you stand beside someone thirty seconds long . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , run around in the shop for a few minutes and look at the vari@@ ance of the plates available for sale . &quot;
it is more likely to be a man@@ ne@@ al gland than a large one .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so the collecting of records is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of records is ... it drives with a loved si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , by which it is said that a new generation of turn@@ tables should be inspired : urban sl@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the sem@@ bl@@ ance that je@@ ans @-@ hot@@ ts , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager , who voted for a moment to think about pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a cro@@ sl@@ ey record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a stair@@ well , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Bu@@ ckl@@ ey , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics that essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees her - perhaps because they are merely purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to address them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record @-@ art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most for luxury items like plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research inquiries made that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in records in Soh@@ o , the great number of female collectors and record @-@ holders who exist in reality , plate @-@ juices and in online @-@ for@@ ks , in@@ calcul@@ ating . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not to walk through the plate of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they irrit@@ ate the star@@ ving view of an un@@ fur@@ tive , 30 @-@ year false moder@@ ator over the shoulders of no longer middle aged men . &quot;

French Court pres@@ ets offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp .
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ zens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle from Cal@@ ais , living in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; in a jurisdiction this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be fu@@ elled to sell 72 tent@@ ative shops in which persons within the camp goods , sell cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sale , hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy , out of which no taxes would be paid and that a fire@@ - and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the nation@@ ally supported union and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also brought out that the provisional shops and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille decided that there were no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who run the 72 pro @-@ visional businesses , but that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people to feed that live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas will offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the young Book Kids &apos;s Café des Lag@@ ers , the common fish and French meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum seek@@ ers for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was called the closing &quot; for this children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
the two aid agencies Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants dro@@ wned on Friday that the number of people in the jungle live has grown over 9.@@ 000 people - the highest number till now - after a steep increase in Neu@@ anch@@ ors in the course of summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ he must adapt to the next generation of speed . in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the Temp@@ os@@ ende are particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic real En@@ forcement trailer the company Vit@@ ronic made in Wiesbaden can be used for example at in@@ genu@@ ity , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police . &quot;
&quot; for example on highway construction sites , or to san@@ i@@ ent bridges with temporary Tem@@ plates , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary bl@@ itzer for the compliance with speed limit . &quot;
a lasting mobile structure can however be too dangerous or time @-@ consuming .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : his cordless scre@@ ened at un@@ interrupted measurement operation five days ; the case data is encrypted via a mo@@ dem .
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all cars can also be recorded over several tracks at the same time . &quot;
variable speed b@@ umps as well as exec@@ ut@@ ver@@ bot@@ e to time , driving and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly developed state , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with a trailer . &quot;
&quot; so that he is not easy to cl@@ ue , it is guided in measurement @-@ operation , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally will also disappear . &quot;
&quot; moreover , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itzer of Vand@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer for details of Vit@@ ronic has been tested in various Länder since 2015 and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; also foreign authorities f@@ aded with the new technique : recently France has declared France 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
&quot; Britain runs silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold &quot;
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came down in the final hur@@ dle in the final hur@@ dle in the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were struck with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ dicated Conference here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , post@@ uring , line @-@ up and ro@@ g@@ her power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ aille of any color . &quot;
the defeat was abandoned by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the Silver medal - Great Britain in this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back in the final . &quot;
but independently of them Fi@@ ji would have be@@ aten the form of a 15 @-@ man team in the form .
it could be a comfort for GB - but it is likely not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow a gold medal is hanging around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former Chief of England from Wim@@ bl@@ edon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost among Ryan of each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap will begin , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and let the attacks GB@@ s have fun of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell to and Co. , when one would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , called O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with even four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai had another attack from the right corner that it turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball attached .
&quot; a h@@ edge tick of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the Wieder@@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there were still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
&quot; V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ et by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line , to make a gate . &quot;
the transformation carried a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB was still st@@ oned . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time to Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favour of the Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ aner , his fans s@@ angen and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ icing with another attempt within the last seconds .
&quot; the plum@@ age , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged , and GB k@@ ick@@ ed crus@@ hed in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; formerly in the day I had defeated Fi@@ ji Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 , and Britain in South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought forth the Bo@@ ks in the first half after the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton crossed the line with an impressive foot@@ ing and scored a gate under the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ tic of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , ranked the profit - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ ine gold than for these games and that wants what hot .
&quot; from the first row@@ point to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who enter into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning at their golden moment on Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if it were only the appl@@ ause , those on the ruins , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was once more present at the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the two @-@ day without a tax woman in the history of the British Sports who laid down on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; your domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least their 39.@@ an un@@ read@@ ed use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ ins , which gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of Spon@@ ges , which is not reflected the way of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the ruin , a batt@@ ali@@ on of wild supporters can contribute to the incre@@ mental advancement that make the difference and there was no more f@@ ain@@ ting than the coach , who would not survive the day 30 months , when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
as he said he is risky .
&quot; I had cancer , the op@@ eri@@ able one and that did it . &quot;
if you do not do that he spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty lim@@ b situation .
it changes a little bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could be at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , to begin what the break down to a minimum , in case that in such circumstances the right term is . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but this makes it a still bigger . &quot;
&quot; the inv@@ isi@@ bility of the victory went their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking in the morning and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in an action in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I could not have wished for a better person for train@@ able or better trainers .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race for the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams started from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much into reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not get rid of it .
&quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not looking forward to make a little rab@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver will be able to appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now you just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have been too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympi@@ asi@@ on@@ ess . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
&quot; here , it took about four minutes . &quot;
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years old for clarity of clarity
&quot; the Managing Director of the Water @-@ purpose &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ acker &quot; , &quot; R@@ aster Gö@@ ller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is regarded as a &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose as an example for the great water producers .
this was the name of some time ago in the origin@@ ality in the post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later the water@@ forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken was announced .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ sers @-@ group &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this stands Ru@@ pert Go@@ ller , who was 31 years in the kenn@@ el , 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he was retired as a retirement age 65 years at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stone group with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , community l@@ essen , promotes a year approximately 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 locations and past@@ ors with approximately 5@@ 500 residents . &quot;
&quot; member states are the churches of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Baun@@ ach . &quot;
for further towns and municipalities there are water supplies .
&quot; the current president , wides@@ brun@@ ns mayor Rec@@ ess in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller 1985 as Water@@ pipe and was appointed as Managing Director of the kenn@@ el . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extend over office management and maintenance activities , the budget creation , calculation of fees and contributions to Emer@@ gency in weekends , &quot; said the Chair . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , they called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and the repar@@ ation of the farmers , the re@@ organization of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the divi@@ ding parts of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stand@@ still available , and I always recorded new additions , because water life was be@@ asts and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised Go@@ ll@@ ers , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart for his aqu@@ atic purpose , and he has lived the water @-@ purpose of purpose , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks ago , he as a real practitioner , he may present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ian @-@ group to nit@@ rate before the water forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken . &quot;
for this he has received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert Go@@ ller , in turn , lau@@ ra Alf@@ ons g@@ rie@@ bel , who have worked with him 28 years with him . &quot;
he is the best water @-@ keeping and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he referred to the Brun@@ n@@ enbau and the restructuring of the Zw@@ ay . &quot;
but the greatest challenge and the har@@ dest use was the tube @-@ breaking at Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on a 3rd January .
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night long , so that the villages were supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn , one can only maintain once , because you filled the high container from P@@ ett@@ stadt with s@@ oses . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel storms from Lau@@ ter who replaces the follow @-@ up of Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man took place on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in an apartment house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ eide ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and they were fatal .
&quot; the man even inv@@ oked with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; said a police spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him I will publicly argue . &quot;
&quot; now nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 m big , mus@@ cular , brown @-@ burned and has a gl@@ at@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police has published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a couple of years old . &quot;
meanwhile the man has a gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the gun to himself so the police .
who Sven S. sees what is supposed to call the 110 call .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim is vintage 1988 , the perpetrators of 1981 . &quot;
&quot; in Lübeck , the competent police in Lübeck , did not want to make any information on the we@@ ather@@ age or the relationship between the perpetrators and victims ; however , they confirmed that a human being was killed . &quot;
it is a T@@ öt@@ t@@ deli@@ kt .

steel - Light@@ view for German steel industry
the crown @-@ toler@@ ated and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in a million @-@ height .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which are the industry from the Eco@@ rom promotion , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; in the release of the Renewable Energy En@@ counter with the components for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really pleased that we could finally reach the negotiations for two years .
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned to put the steel manufacturer , the gases out of the ho@@ oves for power generation for their own consumption , to ask for their use . &quot;
the steel industry remains an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , it now give up a basic certificate with the European Commission for talks with Contest Com@@ miss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators in the steel plants will be replaced , a resolution of 20 percent is to be replaced . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for self @-@ electricity generation .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation will largely be fixed . &quot;
particular importance has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; STAHL is future &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of the emission law , climate and employment targets are bi@@ ased , &quot; &quot; IG Metall manager Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
&quot; last year , the situation continued to grow as the world &apos;s biggest revival in China due to the weak@@ ening domestic demand of mass @-@ scale steel to the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers throw up Chinese steel @-@ dump@@ ing price @-@ dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; to the one show , dri@@ lled ham@@ bur@@ st on impor@@ ters effect , for the other , the economic prospects have opened in China . &quot;
unclear is how sustainable price pick is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices were again rather stag@@ nat@@ ing . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with additional cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also did not want to close the closing of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , approximately 86@@ ,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel manufacturers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; it produces 3,4 million tons of good six percent less cru@@ st@@ ine than in the previous year &apos;s , as the economic union steel on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the amount was brought back to the second month in succession . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is up by two percent below the prior @-@ year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the Association is counting on enhanced order situation with a rising increase . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing sen@@ ders good &quot;
&quot; the singing has already accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already her whole life : a young girl was she in the school choir , in teaching studies she defeated the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old broke into one senior choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physically , describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a sample she feels well @-@ balanced , cheerful and overall lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , she is doing something good for her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; for singing is the same from several perspectives , a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hac@@ kler of the German Sen@@ or@@ en@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most seniors sing in chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded people &apos;s joy in music , describes Hac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , senior social contacts can form and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; for frequently , social and familiar structures solve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir , &quot; to speak and organize themselves to others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , thinks Hac@@ kler . &quot;
because there are exercising a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who regularly calls for his lungs , as well as in everyday life , not as fast as the pu@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; even though it is about obtaining the sound of the voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Association of senior organizations . &quot;
&quot; in older generations the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that the singing or hearing of songs with older people wo@@ ken many memories , often associated with positive emotions of her youth . &quot;
through lyrics and particularly melo@@ dies aside himself denied men suffering from long back events .
&quot; in singing , the head is also called a special accompl@@ ishment , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just older people who live alone , practicing so , not just concentrate on oneself . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through the singing in the choir means Hac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows by the singing in the choir .
to show themselves : if I go for something for a long time I get better and awake beyond me - this experience strengthens .
&quot; good reasons to begin with the singing , there is so enough . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , in stock . &quot;
&quot; it is not alone - at 50 Sin@@ ful people , who h@@ ears it , if a tone goes beside it ? &quot;
looking for the suitable offer have seniors various possibilities , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sing someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , one can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also provide views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir , can turn directly to the church or the Church &apos;s . &quot;
many seniors cho@@ irs can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours around the internet . &quot;
&quot; who desire has to sing , should necessarily join a choir , moved Hac@@ kler . &quot;
singing the soul is good and has a bit liber@@ ating - that is valid for every age .
cats react sensitive as a hang@@ over at Schrei@@ e of the kitt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover which effect the effect of kitt@@ ens has grown up to adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise the rental also left the males not cold - however , they kept in the difference to the females always equal . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arousal level of kitt@@ ens at the Mi@@ row of the Little .
&quot; they react to ten percent faster on lu@@ te of kitt@@ ens who choose to find out in great need , such as scientists from the veterinary University and the Medical University of Hanover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
K@@ ater also respond to the kitt@@ ens of kitt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acou@@ sti@@ cal differences between the mi@@ sts of less and strongly arous@@ ed vir@@ ons for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said the Biolog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is first authorized in the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous examination , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitt@@ ens had distinguished their assistance with the ur@@ gency of their assistance . &quot;
&quot; in total , nine adult kitt@@ ens and eight killing were taken from the animal management of the MH@@ H . &quot;
you have been played for a pack of little ones who were taken for three minutes from the throwing box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; to the other , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger kitt@@ ens , which were additionally highly superior . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the low sampling test for expres@@ sing .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own descendants , rebel@@ li@@ zed at the Schrei@@ e , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned down much faster to l@@ oud@@ speaker when this herd of the most popular kitt@@ ens played .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ed or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Biolog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined many times in humans the reactions of women and men on baby . &quot;
&quot; there were also some studies that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the Biolog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes up with &quot; g@@ ala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ at@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey a arrest warran@@ t was issued against the ein@@ sty football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kl@@ r .
he was accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , a major football match will take place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; in front of the arch@@ al of the arch@@ al between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to commemor@@ ate the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; &quot; business as &quot; &quot; is said . &quot;
&quot; already at the suspension of the exp@@ ir@@ ation after the crash test in July , the government , the everyday life of norm@@ als would not be affected . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to those who are suspected , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt &quot;
he is also uns@@ ett@@ led in front of the football .
against the earlier Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kl@@ r put the prosec@@ ution with a arrest warran@@ t .
&quot; accordingly , the South America lived in America today , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ del@@ r should be followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup attempt &quot;
&quot; though , the first for 90 days of acceptance are still valid till October , in fact that in the life of most Turks , however , does not have any impact on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
the night @-@ time &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end .
sports is - as the whole country - split in supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
particularly fans of the working class of B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not counted among the friends of the President .
&quot; what the gross of the Turks , however , given the dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
there even even the fans agree - regardless of whether their heart for g@@ ather@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sett@@ ling .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be especially arriving to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
his sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the preceding season as proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended up his first playing time as a top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the end game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 @-@ seal .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; rejoice him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the Cup for his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; found the disappointing season for the record @-@ master a irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the Pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; were also early in the Europa League . &quot;
in the South per Li@@ g there was only to rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the Cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; this we have made and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski said . &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as the game was better .
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who took up the base for the 14 title with 26 seasons . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; at the AC Florence , when the AC Florence was issued under the contract standing and presented by B@@ esi@@ on Gom@@ ez , because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday does not return . &quot;
&quot; when Mario wants to come to us , he must just say it , &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; Club@@ chief Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the falls would have to be ready to disp@@ ense about one third of his to 7.5 million Euro estimated that Or@@ man was clear : &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot;
&quot; despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have still medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio , &quot;
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was locked twice due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa may not start in Rio .
others covered athle@@ tics t@@ sinn@@ ers can only laugh - they fight in Rio to medals .
&quot; the topic of dop@@ ing still determines the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa founded after a D@@ oping lock , which had begun immediately before playing games , was gr@@ aded off in her start ( 100 meters breast ) mer@@ ci@@ pl@@ ess and f@@ aded . &quot;
it provided a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenery : with a set smile she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked with their appearance .
&quot; as a rule , they won &apos;t fetch gold , the audience broke out into a J@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are numerous other athletes , which are going to start the start despite dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell , the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the greatest publishers of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time world championship in 2010 had to sit in 2010 a six sm@@ on@@ ati@@ ge sperm after taking the intake of pain Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had a strong tooth pain , defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 was the Olympics of 2012 , World Championships in 2013 and Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster@@ in from 2010 to 2016 positive on the ban stimul@@ ant funding meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin . &quot;
Per@@ kovic comes the first step of the first time and was blocked six months .
the four most advanced thro@@ ws this year are going to the account of the large gold fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics at 400 m , was positive tested and 21 months closed . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement have been responsible , stressed Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world .
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any ath@@ l@@ ete has been recognized as many medals . &quot;
&quot; so , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 to nine years later , after having been established in the testosterone of testosterone . &quot;
&quot; the meantime 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone @-@ abuse . &quot;
&quot; the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the Olympic Games in 2008 received , due to a judgment of the International Maritime Tribunal . &quot;
&quot; with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is on rank two of the world &apos;s list . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the World Teacher and Gold@@ fav@@ ors was tested only in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 years old world world championship in terms of in@@ ges@@ ted supplements found , the sper@@ re of the world @-@ anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency W@@ ada fell mil@@ de and ran already on July 13 . &quot;
bom@@ b in Thailand - Austri@@ ans viol@@ ates
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood in contact with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ early . &quot;
&quot; she suffered a schn@@ apps and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left them again . &quot;
she planned her home trip for early September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the Ph@@ u@@ ket Island , Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on also Austrian citizens are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department always stood in touch with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; at around 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hua H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a h@@ eig@@ ned two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; according to police a Tha@@ il@@ change was killed and about 20 people wo@@ unded , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , two jumps went up again , and according to the authorities a further man was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bom@@ bs of bom@@ bs .
near the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong was in@@ ju@@ red after police information a taxi driver was in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country , another bom@@ b , which killed an urban renewal . &quot;
the spr@@ inkl@@ er was according to the authorities in a fl@@ oral before the prec@@ inct of the coastal police had gone into the air .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations called for det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast , as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the southeast coast several times . &quot;
&quot; I go out from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ ent@@ ate carry the same manuscript , &quot; said He@@ eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to give up a possible moti@@ fs - probably , it is a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to recognize a sample in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ b attacks Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; however , the Thai police declared the attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only a local Sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
it is rather that the bom@@ bs were placed by opponents of the ruling military j@@ unt@@ a .
&quot; in the last days of secrecy the authorities would have been due to im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
still unclear is the group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police took their officials in the whole country , security around important governmental buildings and airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement quarter . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ bing stops , but they usually do not address tourists . &quot;
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Adu@@ ly@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the date of the bom@@ bing bom@@ bing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends this homepage to provide the instructions of the Thai safety authorities necessarily . &quot;
&quot; high safety risks ( security level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security guards and mus@@ cular population , there is no need for travel to these provinces not necessary . &quot;
increased safety risks ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a disp@@ uted referendum on one of the military j@@ unt@@ a processed Constitution .
the military influence of the military influence also in the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta CEO and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bom@@ bs have been an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ate chaos , while the country is heading towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military unt@@ a , which had taken hold of power after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , holds itself first to have led the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it has not been able to get a grip on the military control of the country in the far south of the country in the far south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
&quot; just a year ago , Bangkok was also killed in Bangkok with an attack on a popular Hin@@ du Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them are foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the blu@@ epr@@ int of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is in the spot@@ light of the Bundes@@ am@@ tes for Constitutional protection .
&quot; after several of the state , the Constitutional Court in the Bund defended the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; identity of &apos; cl@@ ue for aspirations against the free democratic basic order , &quot; said Constitutional chief , Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , Zu@@ w@@ ary Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we are monitoring the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity by estr@@ ang@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; Constitutional Court in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority has been closely aligned with the national authorities when deciding . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to prevent their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional chief . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking extre@@ mi@@ sts , speak with y@@ outh@@ ful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the Islam@@ ists did as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a wast@@ ed advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is meant to speak emoti@@ onally .
young people are particularly sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , from several federal states had given reports of the &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; to Af@@ ales politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any findings . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species can only be relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , their target area is changing and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
decisive therefore is whether such people have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the marked increase of legal crimes and attack on asylum seek@@ ers and Refu@@ ge@@ es said Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new rights in this context . &quot;
but we have noticed in recent years that it can be ri@@ ghtful place .
it was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
&quot; it can be quite sure that further ri@@ fu@@ tile group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee centres or attack from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist moti@@ fs . &quot;
but a nation@@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of leg@@ ster@@ ror@@ ism is not recognizable .
the previous groups have emerged on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned are Ma@@ ate that many transitions went to the account of men who previously did not appear in the right scene .
this is the worrying .
&quot; many of the fact on asylum seek@@ ers in asylum seek@@ ers may not have been known as a criminal , politically motivated criminal or trail@@ ers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes committed before with the right @-@ extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left themselves , who then have been radi@@ cal@@ ised by law @-@ extrem@@ ist tun@@ nels . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
do not always determine the Olympi@@ ans or world records at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the aqu@@ atics center , the slightly overweight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia is so slowly that he can no longer be seen in the TV images . &quot;
he disappeared and simple - no matter how far the nec@@ kl@@ ine was selected .
in the social networks Hab@@ te was subsequently referred to as the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a return of 48 seconds ends its preview and ranked the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather a non @-@ spor@@ tive figure , which attracted attention of the international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old nevertheless participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got an extraordinary starting from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries better known .
&quot; as in Ethiopia , most athletes have to run , did not want to make something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ it ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the lap .
some media re@@ signed him as &quot; RO@@ BEL of the whale . &quot;
&quot; in connection to a &quot; &quot; charity &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ blatt &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; made it funny with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter of free style , as did not play a role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney run the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
memorable was the performance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meter of free style .
fr@@ ene@@ tically was fired at the time M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
&quot; at that time 22 @-@ year @-@ old , he discovered only eight months before Olympia and had never taken such a long distance before the competition . &quot;

an elec@@ tro @-@ free vehicle for the Deutsche Post in Action .
the interest from other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the Post is planning to sell your electric car Street@@ sco@@ oter as well .
the Group will soon want to start trade with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office wants to offer its electrical transportation from the coming year also on the free market market .

G@@ FR@@ P leadership occurs after the dis@@ appoint business
the company @-@ based research company Gf@@ K develops his head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ ups suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K allowed to educate that the chair of Vor@@ ar@@ sch@@ ef Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes all the un@@ safer , the longer the successes of him have been promised . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the hel@@ m of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ appoint business pay and the resign@@ ation of the company management is the global number five in the industry prior to a personalized new start .
G@@ FR@@ P &apos;s CEO wants to leave the company to the end of the year .
&quot; the chairman of the Gf@@ K @-@ Super@@ visory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ zes , already with effect from 12 September from the board of directors . &quot;
&quot; the management at the Executive Board already takes charge of the previous Board of Gerhard Ju@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger on September 1 , shared with the company . &quot;
&quot; he should officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; until a successor to Hart@@ mann . &quot;
the company called &quot; different views &quot; for the long @-@ term business orientation .
details wanted to call a corporate speaker on Friday .
&quot; who will be able to make the market research firm in future , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in landing &apos;s travel it was on Friday , during the shareholders , the disappointment in the continued success of the years ago was great . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of the restructuring is still not visible after 5 years , &quot; it was meant . &quot;

accidents - Bus non@@ slip in Kru@@ mm@@ ens@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight sc@@ outs
&quot; at an accident of a tour with 43 seniors as passengers , on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hear@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) eight people have been in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , shared the police with them . &quot;
&quot; the 66 years old driver of the bus company from Eisen@@ ach had to cut their information according to their figures , according to a opposite to@@ aster , which was part of the drive . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right side of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a speaker of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ate the passengers .
six b@@ ail@@ car and an emergency car arrived at the in@@ genu@@ ity on the state road 2 .
the in@@ coming travellers were brought back by a regular bus service to the Kru@@ mm@@ aker District P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the truck and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cu@@ bic metres range from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ank 3,@@ 44 instead of the previous Euro ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( so far 3 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( until now 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ew@@ ater fee will last again later , when appropriate correction measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a over@@ sle@@ eving calculation , the wast@@ ew@@ ater in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4,@@ 37 Euro per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was established in the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rat@@ a Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems are over@@ flowing . &quot;
the market Kas@@ endorf is committed due to a legal basis to operate facilities and to operate facilities .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg must take deeper into the wall@@ et . &quot;
the stir@@ ring increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman , Herbert Schmidt showed the Panel , was a re@@ cal@@ ming of fees needed for waste water systems . &quot;
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 may also be over@@ - or sub@@ covers from the previous calendar period .
&quot; the engra@@ ved hand@@ mix@@ tures was greeted by all three se@@ wage systems for relatively small establishments with a very low waste , that is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution basis , for example , for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the se@@ wage arise in all three plants slightly declined . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the backward step @-@ period during all three plants , not least due to their age , san@@ itation and repair work can be found in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for puppy &apos;s , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p nearly 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt argu@@ ed that in the wast@@ ew@@ ater Az@@ endorf the mechanical system had to be exchanged due to a damage caused by damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk puppy coll@@ ar , the nearly 20 year old convey@@ ors had to be over@@ hau@@ led and in the pond system Lop@@ p had to be installed after nearly 20 years of operation the first plum@@ age , the spon@@ ge and an additional ventilation option to keep in mind the water @-@ legal requirements in future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; at this extraordinary expenses , the advanced super@@ vis@@ ors and maintenance costs were taken into account in accordance with the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 is still under the present level .
&quot; stone houses made clear that in the low wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment in the three lines , the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs have spar@@ ed during the se@@ wage systems in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the above systems will continue to remain prec@@ arious , especially since one could not extend the supply area of the wast@@ ew@@ ater in Fries@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal for these systems because it is a deficit facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July is 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first on zero since October last year as positive 0.3 % were passed .
the annual average rate of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared with the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; consumer prices in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1,0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.4 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.3 % .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; -@@ Eff@@ ect as asi@@ an cartoon cri@@ tici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter Ani@@ me is inspired but some observers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel against breed .
&quot; using his filter tool it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users , to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already emerging as absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or figure that could be from a Roy Lich@@ tenstein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ le@@ ased , compl@@ ac@@ ing tools that generate more than 30 million improved self @-@ ons per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps will reach the public .
snap@@ chat filter have drawn in the past criticism in which they were accused that the app has been prop@@ elled Black@@ face or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week a filter proposed to some users , which gave them lo@@ gs , false teeth and infl@@ amed W@@ angen , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow @-@ haw@@ k . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether this repeated contro@@ versy sur@@ rendered to a larger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and the rebellion were widespread on Wednesday , with reports by The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it has enabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as hom@@ age to Ani@@ me characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; however , out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced r@@ attle , rec@@ alled the filter of hur@@ ting stere@@ otypes . &quot;
other ref@@ uses the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean artist , whose twe@@ et has been widely used over the photos that the filter &quot; vulnerable and w@@ mill was said . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ balance of a very contradic@@ tory asi@@ caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yet secure , but that the money is drawn into the out@@ si@@ veness extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only enterprise that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ in .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless life and integration fight , of conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ chat a large audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in race as their older counter@@ parts - could be more likely to expect sen@@ sibility .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tering a picture created that for a user , it is much harder that such things remain un@@ noticed as it was before , the 25 @-@ year @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to work as product manag@@ ment and engineer for medium to delete their snap@@ chat account , and urged others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she told they believe that racial control switches can reflect a lack of diversity in the settings in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u cri@@ tici@@ zed the large part of white ; only male leaders and ended up their attachment with an has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they don &apos;t have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions where they feel safe or feel at ease . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat was largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any number to the diversity of its employees and points to its status as private companies .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat turned out to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently focused on a human personnel responsible groups and focused on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said that they will be closed their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask myself whether they need more user like us to say that this is not OK . &quot;
military management pres@@ ch@@ art@@ ed IS@@ IS secret information provided by Committee of Congress
&quot; Secretary General of the United States Central Command has changed its award , to record an optimal image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual states of Congress held in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ rel@@ im@@ inary Report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Members of the Defence Committee , Secret Services , and the Wehr@@ budget@@ ary , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Con@@ sci@@ ousness , reported as pres@@ ets made their ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence services provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ ders , signed a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it would have been permitted on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; commented on a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what is happening in Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; he exhibited Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ cans member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the leaders in the Cent@@ Com range to the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the education of the Iraqi army .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence to alter the government &apos;s pointed under Obama &apos;s instructions to change reports , it shows how an@@ al@@ ysts are exposed to the pressure from their suburbs , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half year 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements prior to the Congress were clearly positive than it matches the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com govern@@ ors publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ cans of parliament from K@@ ansas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the peaks of Central Command changed the news reports to play the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the republi@@ cans ri@@ ef@@ en the Task Force in life after they played and an@@ al@@ ysts are worried about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Director of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
democratic members of intelligence services published Thursday on Thursday their own insights that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created a over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of non @-@ release ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest stran@@ ger democr@@ at in the Committee , Adam B. Ship , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Ship , &quot; declare the release of publication &quot; &quot; reports &quot; , &quot; the morality of the analy@@ st and &quot; gave a few space for differ@@ ing opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Bo@@ ats and Democrats agreed to have found no evidence of an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st with regard to a &quot; given political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in August last August , the New York Times reported by the Direc@@ torate of the Pentagon , following complaints from Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a spokes@@ person of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence did not comment reports of Congress , while the investigation of the general strike is still in progress . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence is a contro@@ versy discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigation of effects on the question of a successful air campaign led by US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that by now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question raised that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State remind an inter@@ activity of more than ten years , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a font that saw the recommendations of many an@@ al@@ ysts in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the u@@ prising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker will determine that the statements of government air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries of the Islamic State held no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical refin@@ eries were taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger command owners , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III was critic@@ ised by members of leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure because of its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK . &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner of Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans have won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a worthy power , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , they cannot remember that have ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not belonging to the people who keep their gates in mind .
&quot; however , they know that : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ inside on the first place that remain un@@ occupied after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last play of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already been qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams will reach the first and second place within their group . &quot;
the first placed the strong Dutch will take a little longer out of the way that lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game might go on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising number , four years after they landed over the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years an ho@@ ckey r@@ ack@@ et in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team all went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham was founded , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a culture change , a mental change and a physically change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
&quot; we did not have the work@@ places in London , which we now have . &quot;
we can completely tear the ruin .
on Thursday night he opened the Tor@@ ri@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back@@ stroke from the area .
&quot; India had gone out the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly strong , and held the game of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until they took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; it led a Spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left side , moved to the middle and l@@ up@@ set the ball into the gate for the Americans to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which had previously had to book a gate in any of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of Gl@@ ue &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are consistent and in@@ es@@ capable , a rapid climax between competition and pursuit . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the oly@@ mp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ el himself is a burning piece , which is sufficient from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the swi@@ mmer to the Tur@@ ner to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you can not switch to the TV , read a paper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the coff@@ es@@ hop , without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could quite be sent under these famous names which would be sent to Prime Time , built through sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertisement , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , Tur@@ ner or even a real . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the oly@@ mp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold . &quot;
the oly@@ mp@@ ic flame does not cover any event alike .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognised : air brush , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and may be rule for a long time .
&quot; but if I might make hum@@ bly arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me direct the attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline has been a oly@@ mp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney for the last 16 years , that many people had asked , did not know that there is an Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent Ath@@ l@@ ete to competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ oline and had a athletes until the end of 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans share for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping on the tramp@@ oline has a certain outdoor char@@ ms , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ resolved ear for a Clo@@ wn@@ s@@ School as the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a blin@@ dness enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous tre@@ m@@ bling of his never wanting to end tun@@ nels - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and do@@ cking that combines two sports that are essentially united .
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means as much as the spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; emerging winner jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( rotating , hol@@ o@@ cks and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympi@@ apro@@ og@@ ram , according to execution , difficulty and &quot; plane . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two twin athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio . &quot;
the common oly@@ mp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight .
&quot; medalli@@ sts must continue in their quest for Gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes until the finish , sometimes back and back , upward and down to the playground . &quot;
&quot; they are not only hunting the or@@ in@@ ie or the output wall , but also another cav@@ ali@@ ous goal : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the targeted stri@@ ving is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even sti@@ r up a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it is also what I myself consider when looking at these games as a bit ti@@ ring .
this gives the tramp@@ oline a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a back@@ wards movement is not the target .
&quot; he or she pr@@ ing off , apparently he@@ el@@ os like an astr@@ on@@ aut , goes to the top , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; here also there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hate attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant removal of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games only can be .
&quot; the qualification and final cleaning of women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will end the final round as part of a afternoon blocks on both days .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; when the awareness raising awareness only through the anxiety and the object of male ath@@ l@@ ete can be achieved - as it sm@@ ote the male US Tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal recently , then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his after air rin@@ ce , new fan base . &quot;

violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; demonstr@@ ators , who are demanding political changes in Ethiopia , adher@@ ing to violent resistance of the government . &quot;
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police at work .
is Ethiopia just to come together ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid composite of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
but in the last months protests against the government the land and spread out into ever more areas .
last week thousands of people on the streets were slo@@ wed down political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses passed on that polic@@ emen were on zig un@@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
&quot; in circulation @-@ well @-@ being videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year are to show how vulner@@ abilities are young people with p@@ eg@@ s , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN High Authority on Human Rights is now calling for a more @-@ depth examination .
&quot; it has always been difficult to meet this country and in future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa to Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ian forces to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expands in the considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pec@@ tin in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
&quot; even if Ethiopia has been anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations , the opposition in the country was led by the government - the opposition in the country was reduced , whereby dis@@ si@@ dents were effective . &quot;
&quot; many have been sent into exile or into prison , or in the walls of the desert . &quot;
but this could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ tube Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in central Ethiop@@ ia . &quot;
all the youth are prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments that cover all from ground use until the stran@@ gl@@ ehold imposed in terms of power of the governing coalition .
&quot; after a widespread choice last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions along the border with Eritrea ; a fight for this tender , controversial line demanded in June hundreds of lives . &quot;
an@@ al@@ ysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden which were more or less forced to benefit the turbul@@ ence over the past few years .
several factors explain why emotions of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of the bite under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first appears to be harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians had been able to communicate with social media because cheap smartphones have been more frequent and improved the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government gives access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies which conc@@ eal where they stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians added that they were so many people gathered together .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mainly Christian high @-@ countries , in the politics and the economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims live and live in flat land areas . &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are thereby to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests found in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in military services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebellion of rebellion , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; an@@ al@@ ysts say that it was particularly rever@@ ted to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special officers , to edit opponents and make them in@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the present regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict of conflict . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ att@@ ain@@ able reasons to assume the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
an@@ al@@ ysts are saying that he does not enjoy the confidence that he obtained from the Tig@@ ray provides controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time , Ethiopia has been living in such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ rac@@ ted according to the analy@@ st and subsequently stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following swe@@ eps many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months , and that time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts in Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as the new pend@@ ant move , as well as for their measurable progress on fighting poverty . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month &apos;s prot@@ esters in gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ish city , from Tig@@ ray @-@ shops and the hat@@ red towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more widespread in social media . &quot;
an@@ al@@ ysts are saying that the protests of the USA and other Western allies are able to position a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though they have recently investigated that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to support democracy , he will not want his fo@@ amed in a already vol@@ ati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin w@@ aving . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp declares his claim Obama was created by IS@@ IS &apos; Sar@@ cas@@ m .
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp was trying to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ versy , that surrounds his campaign by saying that his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
this clar@@ inet cast new questions to the communication skills of the presidential election of Republi@@ cans on whether it is able to communicate clearly and understandable to the American public .
&quot; it also brings his collabor@@ ators who strive to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in the peculi@@ ar position , declar@@ ations that he could not meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having made the distinction during an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp had made with respect to the claim on Thursday and existed in interviews that he really does not intended to argue that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp , he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; the t@@ we@@ et was opposed to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp would help to weak@@ en the statement a bit off by reading him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , the Republi@@ can Ukrainian presidential did@@ acy did not know about it . &quot;
the last storm of the criticism is pr@@ un@@ folded to Mr. Tru@@ mp while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of diar@@ rhe@@ a turnover to the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this topic again .
&quot; on Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself , when he said , the Russians should hear Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but he said later &quot; Nat@@ asha &quot; I said the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then move back to your needs .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test , how certain messages will arrive by his fans how to arrive , and then appropriate &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has an even estim@@ able sound , since its revenues have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was published on Friday , a tour with great lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ head @-@ head in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp has generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often blame his critics to conc@@ eal his statements or fal@@ si@@ fying his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he is strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ faith in the in@@ convenient situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative might be his statements also . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had formed the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Barack Obama was an almost un@@ familiar , small organization , he called her back@@ sli@@ der , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstre@@ am Republi@@ cans try to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as a foreign minister , it accepted IS@@ IS allowed to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them before , on each of his words , and to be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he gro@@ an@@ ed the &quot; poor , &quot; Flemish &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; You can not ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats have filed for Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ology as only a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once passed over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ id café in Williamsburg , where you can only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years a good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bedford Avenue shop was pushed . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , made the verb in the summer of 2014 , s@@ ells soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people consuming it as the last loss in a gene@@ tics city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap @-@ business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , then it is re @-@ finding . &quot;
&quot; a recur@@ rent Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing team of old cafes , owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
&quot; as a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained many things . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els , the same es@@ pres@@ so @-@ model . &quot;
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wich@@ es with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like caps and su@@ itted oni@@ ons .
there is natural travel bow@@ ls .
&quot; the café serves no beer more , there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months Rodri@@ guez , Rodri@@ guez that he had noticed a steady stream of old tri@@ bal customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also eliminated from Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , dwelt in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after they moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee house , she said . &quot;
&quot; I realized that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea to this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ term and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb .
he went there before work and ordered inev@@ it@@ ably always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with butter . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez : he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he switches his Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t have a gru@@ dge about it that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie were offered to establish a special soap for verb with the cold bre@@ wing coffee of the coffee as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will still go on her offering , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated into Poland and Rodri@@ guez , that he has imagined to make them soon , so that his new neighbours are welcome . &quot;
the site also has further advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill the cold bre@@ wed coffee to the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the cafe is expanding to a recur@@ ring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favourites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tri@@ bal and said he was destroyed by the floor when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the presence of the loc@@ ale and the bri@@ gh@@ ten a new coffee as well as a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to cra@@ wl , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; ample meal &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , took his lunch in the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as a gour@@ met president Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for elaborate Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen on Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Wasser@@ sch@@ ild@@ ste@@ al soup .
&quot; his menu on that day was a bit modest : stu@@ ff@@ ed eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , potato p@@ ü@@ ree and as dessert a p@@ aving p@@ d@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both foodstuffs histori@@ an .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; played by the Chinese fare in the United States , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a living house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American food during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; you showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ por@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sle@@ epy I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in business since the IP@@ O 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cream cheese with olive @-@ dog , while en@@ e ate , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato p@@ ie and vegetables . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ por@@ ter h@@ ackers ordered , this found the pair for discussion about food in the era of great depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
there was cru@@ m@@ uss@@ bread , liver cheese and b@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap to extend the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
co@@ ir@@ sm@@ ir@@ ked .
&quot; it must have placed in the stomach like a lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women co@@ iled for male workers , and it became fresh@@ ly baked past@@ ries for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans who were star@@ ving during the First World War to star@@ ving Europeans . &quot; &quot; A Square Airlines &quot; &quot; marked the ways with which the country had to turn to be no longer the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense issue , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense was the new budget : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and bar@@ gain have been recovered to stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ ver@@ ings as a &quot; wonderful way , eating , due to coo@@ ks un@@ appe@@ als , since coo@@ ks un@@ appe@@ als to hide themselves among a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dry dry .
&quot; meat , the years of central American food was , became a rare luxury luxury . &quot;
peculi@@ ar compounds were tried out since a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy chefs .
&quot; during their research for the book , which includes also recipes , prepared c@@ egel@@ man a dish from that epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ anu@@ t butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues out : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ t butter and baked oni@@ ons are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , exagger@@ ations - among them Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country are such . &quot;
&quot; by using recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; households &quot; and the challenge to transform Pamp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square ) &quot; is a festival of historic ti@@ d@@ bits .
&quot; in particular , the reports of the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ I @-@ eat @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa farm@@ houses of his kitchen and sp@@ ells , like the Million @-@ Million @-@ Dollar Man of World , to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental kitchen like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ king .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully realistic .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt perhaps could have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have promp@@ ted him to begin with his stomach a c@@ ach@@ et .
&quot; as described in the book , the recru@@ iters of a household with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought forth the boring eating in Washington but also one of the most sur@@ est prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the types from the era of great depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the land came back onto the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
the pair gave us better understood when writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; you made people really sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ shield .
&quot; after the plate were cleared from Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they passed and Co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the Pfl@@ au@@ ban , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt to noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a perpet@@ ual trick , hum@@ ble recipes may send a send name to you . &quot;
&quot; there was no stor@@ ed cream , just p@@ aving , slightly fl@@ our , sugar , water and c@@ inn@@ amon . &quot;
each dive slightly resist@@ ed a spo@@ on in the teeth , brown limb@@ s . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it tasted not bad . &quot;
co@@ e pick up three times a stroke .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ er , he said to his wife , &quot; A few ch@@ opped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o
he set his own life in the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ki@@ ed everything to save the lives of others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old even died at a bom@@ b attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , which saved his life according to image of almost 6@@ 0,000 people . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 Volunte@@ ers put your own life in the game to educate people out of bom@@ bed houses , and help to deliver first aid to the war . &quot;
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civil arm@@ chair , showing him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby out of the ruins of a house , 2014 went around the world . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans for the shining symbol@@ ism in the gray of the war .
&quot; but as a hero he has never seen himself , &quot; &quot; says : &quot; &quot; for me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I am trying to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar fell victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; helic@@ opter have shed four Fass@@ bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with ch@@ org@@ as . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven men suffer from respir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; we fix the toxic rem@@ n@@ ants of the bom@@ b so that not children play with it , &quot; c@@ ites the picture of his last words before he died . &quot;
the killing of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Grön@@ land : the oldest sp@@ ine is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land ha@@ ie usually comes only in the winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Ser@@ ann@@ um S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie won only 150 years of care .
&quot; the Grön@@ land shar@@ k along the ground of the Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ ti@@ ks along the ground , in an hour it reaches an average of 1,@@ 220 meters far . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , speeds up the five meters long animal on s@@ atte 2,@@ 6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
this from the lon@@ eliness of lon@@ eliness however seems to be a bul@@ let for a high age .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the magazine &quot; Science &quot; at any rate by a Greenland shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity &quot; , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ adventurous , by the Max Plan@@ ck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this span of span that signi@@ fies a world record for sp@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are st@@ alt . &quot;
only faul@@ ty the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are difficult to watch , after all they live mainly in the Eis@@ meer in front of the thin@@ ly populated coast of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they appear on the surface mostly only in winter . &quot;
&quot; according to the lifesty@@ les of Greenland , researchers know accordingly little . &quot;
her Zeit@@ l@@ up@@ ent@@ emp@@ o Ma@@ ts them as they assisted six animals with one transm@@ itter .
&quot; loo@@ t make these shar@@ ks anyway : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the rem@@ n@@ ants of a stur@@ geon , another one had the p@@ utt@@ les of a young polar bears . &quot;
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek Kad@@ aver that are tor@@ ques from higher water layers to bottom .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland , the fisher@@ man between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long while the biggest 5@@ 02 cen@@ timeters .
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , analyzed it with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lo@@ wers of the shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ et appears before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which included in it will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ ker .
&quot; therefore , your birth should therefore lie after the early 19@@ 50s , as an atomic tests of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in which with 220 cen@@ timeters length , third smallest animal with@@ contained the liner notes on the other hand a low over@@ shot of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all the larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie had on its lenses , on the other hand , normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timet@@ res long Greenland a age of 335 years , while the rek@@ ord @-@ shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 cen@@ timeters can even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Grön@@ land females get only then offspring , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
the researchers were able to arrange an age to the length .
&quot; as one of the animals stood with 3@@ 92 cen@@ timeters on the cus@@ p of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined , Grön@@ land with the multip@@ lication obviously have at least one and a centuries of time . &quot;
&quot; also , this is also likely to be the world record . &quot;
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in iron waters is no coincidence .
&quot; also the previous record @-@ card , an 211 year old Greenland gl@@ w@@ al , in whose sp@@ eck in the neck , was caught a 120 year old har@@ row , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism also runs on as@@ parag@@ us there . &quot;
they mature then later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep themselves warm in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal temper@@ ate warmth . &quot;
the heat loss of a grams of mouse is therefore much greater than a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on getting many kitt@@ ens as early as possible , &quot; &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot;
&quot; however , a very big animal should invest rather in long life on the other hand . &quot;
ground floor in a double @-@ pack
&quot; with topics around the building , the municipal council has focused on the most recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief the body accepted the communication by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the most recently @-@ proven residential buildings can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the real estate , par@@ cel@@ li@@ ction and coverage , clari@@ fied and the moti@@ ons were clari@@ fied , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; road l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( Area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Sale section 1 ) to interested parties nothing more in the way . &quot;
the council is convinced that the bro@@ oks are in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and r@@ üs@@ ous seniors equally to speak .
&quot; as it meant , the board may register now in the city hall , via the en@@ core of the plots , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September plenary session . &quot;
&quot; in order to include also requests for the rel@@ ocation of other industrial enterprises , connected to the creation of jobs , we decided to re@@ change the municipal council , which will be re@@ constructed only in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the field of sub@@ periods that has already been expanded there around two plots in direction to the state road . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the city on the Main will therefore compete with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities to shift from London to shift jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt am most from Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field of financial markets and the real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to be running out of London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
the approval for the so @-@ called EU passport is sufficient for them as far as approval in the UK .
this is the use of large US banks .
several banks have already mentioned to shift jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; counts with 10000 new jobs on the Main bin@@ nen five years .
&quot; in Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , united the responsibility for monetary policy and the supervision of the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as other important authorities as the European insurance impact EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk of risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is head@@ quartered , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the reception is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg enjoys a large fund industry , cutting , but as well as Dublin in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt be clearly easier to reach Frankfurt thanks to the great airport .

&quot; in a ranking of the Management Consult@@ ancy Mer@@ cer reads the city to accommodate seven , Luxembourg on No. 19 , Dublin , square 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if the quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors . &quot;

&quot; in a cr@@ ust , Donald Tru@@ mp hidden behind wrong proportions and pull @-@ out concerning his previous promises to be published . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential data to publish their tax states , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York busin@@ es@@ sman , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for its with@@ hold a tax examination by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ ton &apos;s campaign assistant in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , concerning the publication of the presidential election of Democrats . &quot;

&quot; Clinton had already pointed out on the subject and published on Friday a video on the internet , in the high @-@ level Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp and ask for its tax return . &quot;
on Thursday she spoke the subject even during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he refuse to do what any other presidential did@@ acy has done in recent decades , and to publish its taxes in recent decades . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has paid for two years or only very little taxes , and an economic journalist of the New York Times voted on Friday a number of tax @-@ forests and tax advice , the data that could still be the case . &quot;
Bundes@@ liga has become a subject in the elec@@ toral campaign .
&quot; Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ et , which would make sure people earn more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal as well .

&quot; the declaration of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these are only USD 100 in income in income , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; her main ambition was a cost @-@ effective index Fund , from which the Clin@@ ic divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 are tax@@ ed . &quot;

cond@@ oms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works and Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant bull
&quot; nature protective elements in Tanzania are using an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from being inhabited , in people hab@@ itable settlements - they throw cond@@ oms on them that are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der . &quot;
&quot; the method has proved effective and the honey@@ guide Foundation which had already been intensi@@ fying the idea of years ago , having rest@@ ores volunteers in villages in the North Tanz@@ ani@@ as to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their houses and harvest without inj@@ ure animals . &quot;
previously many spec@@ s have used to defend oneself .
Friday is the telephone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed this ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe within these congreg@@ ations a change to their attitude while they are much more confident that they can hold up the eleph@@ ants from their fields without need@@ ing to harm the president of honey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; if he is not shi@@ vering , one so called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der rented together with earth is wrapped together with a fire@@ works in a con@@ dom , whose end to the ig@@ nition is filmed . &quot;
&quot; when it comes down , the con@@ dom with a bu@@ d on and spr@@ inkl@@ ed fine dust at Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der into the air . &quot;
a hint quite usually already from to chase the eleph@@ ants .
&quot; one last chance represents an adverti@@ ser , which is a gold fire@@ work in the air and is a loud , bright Explo@@ sion . &quot;

Jewish Director Dis@@ suggests Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arabic &quot; challenge - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media er@@ up@@ tion , after betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pre @-@ election in Berlin since it would have requested arab@@ ic guests according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; sent his anger at Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann has been trying to find Israel on the site op@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; the country , however , was not listed between the countries which can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
after a statement the director turned to the hotel &apos;s reception .
&quot; the answer that he received , &quot; &quot; cked him &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel provided that the measure is an &apos; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels .
&quot; the reason behind it stood , the fil@@ th in the fil@@ mm@@ aker even more anger . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs , and they have demanded that the pres@@ election is deleted , was named by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli amb@@ assador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ trad@@ es@@ sman called this a &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reported the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were mis@@ led by this event and troubled .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
&quot; the fact that this has spent in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even a still greater shame . &quot;
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; draws the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the author . &quot;
&quot; the incident , a fairly large reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people knew the whole a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some studied the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged wor@@ ding of Arab guests .
&quot; as@@ ham@@ ed of you , &quot; he called it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near to the synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all the accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , Israel does not enter into the quick@@ dial list , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a speaker at Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
add that the country code has now been added .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions grew according to the Russian amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade range between Moscow and Teheran in the year rose by 7@@ 0.6 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in the country , distributed to the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies have existing links with Iran , while new companies are ready to access the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further trade agreement is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade range between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.6 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 per cent and bet@@ ray $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the merch@@ ant was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land@@ vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan runs for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian deployment of around 35.@@ 000 vis@@ as , first of all travel vis@@ as , an Iranian citizen . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries that affect the tourist count in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record of ear@@ thly tourists in Russia will be broken by the last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians come to Iran , something that the amb@@ assador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home to scored as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ chor@@ age , who had made his Land@@ smann Sir Chris Ho@@ y and made the legend that he stor@@ med a victory of the favourites New Zealand . &quot;
England four years ago claimed a sho@@ cking victory in Ho@@ y the fifth of six Olympi@@ ans .
they repeated the trick after they took place in March at the Rail World Championships in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys only a modest square .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a result .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap to close the ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they remained when they saw the potential in the vill@@ i that now un@@ folds .
&quot; Hin@@ y , Kenn@@ y - the winner of four years ago with Ho@@ y and Sk@@ inner sat down in the qualification round a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the stand@@ ar@@ round round the New Ze@@ al@@ ets in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ di was just back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner stopped . &quot;
a strategy change made a huge part of the transformation from the execution in a higher gear to dec@@ eler@@ ate it and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to hold the pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert , and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they were on the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; It is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make myself a name .
we have put up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and the world leaders have defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der gave to him that he fell inten@@ tionally to the railway after a weak start . &quot;
he returned that statement later and there was no objection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an amazing victory there was no such problem .
&quot; Hin@@ du said , &quot; It feels like the whole GB Flags on the Tri@@ bun@@ es like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible again to win at the Olympi@@ ad again .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were seven of ten titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of possible that he is repeated the victory of three oly@@ mp@@ ic gold medals in a contest . &quot;
&quot; that would be born for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , which was also born on 23 March ( a apparently sacred date for the British sport ; on the day also Steve Edit@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
this is the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes place next in the spr@@ int which begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ du said , &quot; If he wins two further gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medalli@@ sts of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the quick@@ est performance in the four @-@ four miles running . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world record , which won in London gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins , with certainty . &quot;
he had tr@@ apped yesterday with officers in front of the qualification as him tr@@ acked to measure his height .
&quot; in the appropriate women contest , the morning continued and ended , av@@ anced Laura Des@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ ving in Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ era in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team rel@@ ies on its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a s@@ ary of medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio has been run@@ down .
&quot; it also played drama in the background , so the resign@@ ation of the Technical Chief Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of sex@@ ism and bullying , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite like that could be the now legendary reputation GB@@ s that has reached its peak at the perfect moment . &quot;
the future of the mel@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the end of energy demand
&quot; the future of the aluminum mel@@ t@@ els of Port@@ land in Victoria and as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are at stake , since the plant operator announce the energy supplier without reaching all the supply agreements , such as the supply of energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
for a 20 years of fixed subsidies it runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed at a closing .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ o@@ effect as the mel@@ ting is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ t@@ ei , which led last year to the closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the mel@@ ts of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risk a closing .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the weekly basis for the installation . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the great aluminum mel@@ ts with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , which will keep the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L is assum@@ ing that the plant in Port@@ land is continuing to operate , which means another physical demand for electricity by mel@@ ting , divided the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the agreements were called &quot; &quot; f@@ use services &quot; , &quot; which would have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of cancellation so that they may end in 2017 .
&quot; thus AG@@ L is assum@@ ing that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the electricity supplies . &quot;
all the potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong operating markets for major retail prices .
&quot; AG@@ L shared with that the value of the Tre@@ aties was already written in the year of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of an cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the Tre@@ co@@ as to operate the &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; &quot; or to guarantee the power supply to the mel@@ ting &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that there will be a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would like to enter into force one year later , even if there is still a statement why it has resign@@ ed from the contract . &quot;
an@@ al@@ ysts were war@@ n because of the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of Port@@ land Sch@@ mel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st in the early week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land use approximately 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; should both systems from the market disappear , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as generating sets it would not be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ th@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the sep@@ t@@ ember of the vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ omin@@ ator , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ th@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ ite C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand amb@@ assador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and went to the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers to the wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the v@@ eiling of the Co@@ vers was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ om@@ ans ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ th@@ hi@@ an On@@ c@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as it ends the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn : they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the cl@@ amation of nearly every birthday sep@@ t@@ ame ( Se@@ ac@@ rest led the phrase , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten &quot; , &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , but Kr@@ is had to get to participate in this public@@ ist city . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the September issue of the vo@@ gue , safety has started a new era of Lake Garda . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ om big sister Kim likes it , as far as the Vo@@ gue @-@ Cover is concerned , ( they and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue is a League for itself . &quot;
the sep@@ tum is the most sold @-@ after issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , resem@@ bles a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista by the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
&quot; the revelations of his cover stars is expected that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine are still deb@@ ated prior to the official announ@@ cements . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover were Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more &quot; &quot; celeb@@ rities &quot; , &quot; the Model@@ n &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ rities are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar winner &apos;s winner and Di@@ or brand amb@@ assador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the Cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even at the very low chance that woman j@@ omin@@ ator - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; break @-@ model &quot; &quot; of her generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or Reality stars or young people from today , who know how to chat a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it &apos;s all to apply on den@@ omin@@ ator ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers like success not everyone . &quot;
with her Reality TV history J@@ enn@@ ers was always a bit stra@@ ined in the fashion world .
&quot; in June he cri@@ tici@@ zed the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ omin@@ ator and their colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d , and called it &quot; the Mist@@ y of Oph@@ thalm@@ ologists . &quot;
these feelings were again high when the message with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but to ride on the mis@@ ut seems to be at the point in front .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ omin@@ ator is on the cover of the sep@@ t@@ ember of the vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they are sold by her native pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine SE@@ X@@ Y .
and in their free time she is in Reality TV to see . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centers annually include 16@@ 0.000 people every year
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 of the country , more than 16@@ 0.000 of the country are rejected every year by the coun@@ seling centers , while the sector is already taken on the effects of further medi@@ ated transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , aid workers , victims of violence and those , who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ers and similar proceedings - at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already obsolete , make up for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , this legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
&quot; the director of the Municip@@ al centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Union of Municip@@ al centers y@@ iel@@ ded , that thousands of people are refused every year . &quot;
Far@@ rell said that the situation without lifting of the federal government would only be worse .
&quot; que@@ ens@@ lands community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with uns@@ afe and op@@ pressing debt , families that have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey indicates that they can not get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the Federal Government is to cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of help people are forced out of Queensland with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the General advoc@@ acy and Federal Minister of Justice , as well as sen@@ ators from Queensland George Bran@@ dis to quickly raise these medi@@ ations so that people can get the help they need to obtain legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the national government met its commitment to raise funds for legal action on national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their client communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; with the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are considerable losses for government parties and CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; this takes representative surveys of the Clinical Research Institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government would be in the north shortly further , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to government the government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD was rus@@ hed by 35,@@ 6 per cent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to survey , the party saw that according to survey only just ahead of the CD@@ U which could return to 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is controversial from the left and the Af@@ ales .
&quot; the Left came up to 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; in spite of lighter losses with 6 percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 percent ) back to the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by three per cent in the country &apos;s day .
&quot; in the Berlin event of Berlin , the SPD of the survey is estimated that only 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached by 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 per cent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented with 14 percent for the first time in the hospital .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss the one in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in Zeit@@ l@@ upe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the successor to domin@@ ate the world - his producer lived a disaster .
the unit wei@@ gh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ og@@ ram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and larger , therefore it was not good at hand . &quot;
on the contrary it was rather ever@@ lasting .
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would increase with high resolution today for about two professionals . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gig@@ abyte .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came to the business meeting exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros enthusiasts can still buy the devices on the internet , but they are somehow from the stone &apos;s st@@ one@@ age of the dormit@@ ory . &quot;
but twenty years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before on the Computer@@ messe C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the press @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent by a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
even access to web pages was possible by HTML @-@ browser even though qu@@ itting slowly .
a pocket was available to a digital addres@@ s@@ book and an electronic calendar .
&quot; there was a small ant@@ enna , and the mobile phone could be done similar to a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was at 3@@ 92 euros .
&quot; nobody was able to susp@@ end in August 1996 , that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot;
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile phones of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented d@@ amping , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , domin@@ ate the market today , who came all a lot later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday . &quot;
2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; more than 1,@@ 4 billion devices have been sold , on the Samsung and Apple , only 555 million pieces of it were sold . &quot;
worldwide sales with the devices is roughly 400 billion euros .
this will come to the well @-@ running business of the countless App @-@ providers and the telecommunications company .
around the smartphone in the meantime a whole industry was formed .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in the beginning of 2007 , at the time , Apple @-@ Chief Steve Jobs at the Mac @-@ World , announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , everything via touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Len@@ ovo and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the night view . &quot;
&quot; they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the legends are now Apple and asi@@ an providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention is a matter of course .
&quot; as a result , each German now looks for 88 times a day to his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we must all learn to put the smartphone into the smartphone , &quot; &quot; just Jan@@ ina atmospheric , is responsible in the Siemens @-@ Board of personnel . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must channel the oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local communities , and all of London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , that was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great deal of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will reach new opportunities for local resident and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities we are alone already 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , create 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ using on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly and they will be wrong at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
&quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of capabilities and employment both around the airport and all the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have achieved a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a result of the world &apos;s leading airport sub@@ li@@ minal , up to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented drive in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investments . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am hop@@ eful that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time to bro@@ aden our oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and lifting He@@ ath@@ row as well as helping our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of the England .

&quot; for companies that earn with online @-@ fri@@ ction cash coming according to one of the software manufacturers attempts , indication block , a &quot; &quot; kitt@@ ens and mouse play &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there were ad lock@@ ings on its desktop , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ gger in which it communic@@ ates that users can update their filters in the program to once again block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the en@@ coding for its advertisements , in order to show it the indication that part of advertising is to be difficult to detect . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to deal with new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ gger post the speaker wrote by Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ und @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the early broad@@ ening Open Source Community and the envel@@ ope already underway since the invention of ad @-@ lock@@ ers in progress , and that it is possible to see Facebook soon with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s world &apos;s largest company for social media has turned into battle , is a strong indication of how worrying outlook for the industry have become . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people indication , nearly four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with exp@@ ire billion every day active users , who access Facebook on their mobile devices , makes hand@@ y@@ value 84 percent of the adverti@@ sers fac@@ ebook . &quot;
&quot; the company has used it on ad recorder on desktop PCs except , because mobile Display block , does not have any effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared an speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient size of revenue , so that Facebook appears to be an investment in such a step as rewar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday Facebook with , that it would be &quot; &quot; ad w@@ ool tool &quot; &quot; to give the people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook , Facebook was maintained new filters , because they would also block contents on the side that are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users this does not represent a positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , shared a spokes@@ man by Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; ad recorder are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have concentrated on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
women with suspected su@@ ic@@ ide on Swiss highway travel
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls to witness after a woman was handed over to a highway on Thursday during the early hours of the morning at a thought su@@ ic@@ ide by several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman placed himself in the Dark Ones in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a silence at the age of 49 years , which was driven by several vehicles , including a bur@@ ner , even kill himself . &quot;
she died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not been identified yet , the police said this as well as any witnesses of the incident occurring on it . &quot;
&quot; it became an investigation @-@ procedure opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided the G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avoidable ?
&quot; that is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable .
&quot; in each of the two cases - when a person ran into the Dark Ones on the highway - was decided that the drivers don &apos;t need to assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night is running on the highway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
last year a polic@@ eman was acqu@@ itted after having passed a man and killed that was killed in August 2014 a night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrific@@ es had been dr@@ unk and became the street unconscious , dismis@@ sed the court . &quot;
&quot; the Court set out that the polic@@ eman responded to an emergency response -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ een situation &quot; was , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
everyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday in the proximity of Morges should sign in the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate : Venus was once hab@@ itable
Venus was probably even hab@@ itable according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate system .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could en@@ umer@@ ated with its hot , water @-@ loose surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once more . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their tight atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , sublime atmosphere and still revol@@ ved . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry areas as de earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to control life and be even faster al@@ arm@@ our . &quot;
the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation exp@@ ires the long turn of Venus their tail@@ oring the sun almost two months long , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which affects the surface of a large portion of the sun @-@ heating . &quot;
the result are average temperatures that are some degree of cooler than that of the Earth today .
&quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution , which was previously suspected by Plan@@ etary researchers . &quot;
although it was probably lying hab@@ itable was the Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ low heat and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light exposed .
your oceans ev@@ oked and its water v@@ ap@@ or was burned down from the ultr@@ avi@@ olet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen@@ esis , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,@@ 4 billion issues will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared with an average of about $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler provides rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star v@@ ades of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
&quot; the latest Mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers , the most organized catalogue of Rot@@ ation rates among the stars of the star rating of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data can help the astronom@@ er to understand why stars in the star amounts to different ran@@ ates , as well as in what context the rot@@ ational periods are related to the planets . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ ing of our results with other star@@ ters , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the observ@@ atory of the Pl@@ ei@@ aden lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this constell@@ ation , which emerged above 125 million years ago , are now reaching the adult . &quot;
you are now turning the fastest .
&quot; to top rates , this gri@@ pping stars encounter large amounts of stars . &quot;
&quot; since these win@@ ders travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a br@@ isk effect on the stars . &quot;
if a star altern@@ ate he begins to dec@@ eler@@ ate his rotation .
&quot; Ke@@ pler provides the rotation rate of any star , by showing the time between the appearance of an enligh@@ tening constell@@ ation -- like sun@@ spots -- . &quot;
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ary mar@@ riages pointed out that more more more more than less massive stars revol@@ ve as less massive stars .
Reb@@ ge compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ bles as smaller . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Ball@@ et &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be mass@@ aging , mass@@ acre , while being ten@@ ded to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the ast@@ rolog@@ ist of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the qualities like rot@@ ary rates . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ ters of the Pl@@ ei@@ aden presents an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how the How , W@@ ann and why stars its red rates dec@@ eler@@ ate and speak their &quot; dance . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported detailed report on their most recent analysis of the Pl@@ agues of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades who will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a disp@@ uted bas@@ eball star will be starting
the tears ran from Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US Bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to base .
&quot; after his emotional return of announcement , the 41 year old professional to the Tampa Bay R@@ ays will present the last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; to the &quot; &quot; declared 14 @-@ star @-@ game participants from Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez for the most valuable player of the league , 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature of a ten @-@ year contract has been filed for 27 million US dollars since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 , he will be reli@@ eved as advisor and youth coach in the future as well as in full content . &quot;
as a player Rodri@@ guez a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays are just two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
&quot; however , in the rest of the bas@@ eline of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old may not be absorbed . &quot;
&quot; for so successfully Rodri@@ guez - Nickname &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field was , so controversial is the appearance outside of the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; was announced , between 2001 and 2003 t@@ ying ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games in August 2013 due to a completion in the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; thesis sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; till the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main suspic@@ ious , for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida . &quot;
after a dispute the spar@@ row was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez at that time . &quot;
even his far@@ ewell days doesn &apos;t run out .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games still get the big stage , Rodri@@ guez frequently had to sit on the bank . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a far@@ ewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves the attempt to win any game , estimated Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az and the circumstances with Pop@@ star Madonna and the actress Kate was told , sympathy @-@ hat@@ s of the fans of Y@@ ank@@ ee Ar@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; s@@ angen the pend@@ ant at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive d@@ op@@ ing@@ probe , Wei@@ th@@ eber must not start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
a caught ath@@ l@@ ete has been made almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official d@@ op@@ inci@@ dents have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ barriers from Bulgaria and the Polish weight of Adrian Ziel@@ ona were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical cl@@ am@@ ity competitions this news leads to the accident . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the dioc@@ ese of hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ d has been proven that is used as a mas@@ tic means for dop@@ ing instances . &quot;
the International Sport@@ sman CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon in the middle of their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only for 0.@@ 09 seconds then they missed the bronze medals . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the pre@@ ring over 50 m of freedom .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and an hearing in the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association should take the matter very seriously , and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation with the exam@@ inations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ sman CAS and will accept judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the sanctions of the ath@@ l@@ ete with positive cases is responsible . &quot;
&quot; also at night of Rio le@@ aded the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ec@@ owa through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went by himself into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the athle@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , the substance is said to act on the bot@@ tom@@ ed substance of the EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ec@@ owa has temporary suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be positive . &quot;
Bulg@@ arians Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w announces itself immediately with criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; We Do not stand under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all weights from the chron@@ ically @-@ dop@@ ing nation must not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ ona &quot; &quot; was also known as the London Olympi@@ asi@@ eger in the class up to 85 kg , like his brother Tomas@@ z has been positive tested on the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both argue , however , both may not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
before the start of the Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ ete is especially the case Dan@@ ec@@ owa a further severe blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF had not allowed the whole Russian crew to an exception because of systematic D@@ op@@ ings , but also the L@@ acqu@@ eline Kenya in Rio produces numerous bad news . &quot;
in the swimming pool also the former off@@ ences in China had also taken care of a fier@@ ce debate between the athletes .
so grab@@ bing the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium about 200 m of free @-@ style , I will be handed over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the center of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ ds , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positive for the Chinese Championships on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ ackers their sol@@ vent
programmers of Er@@ rors @-@ Mal@@ ware currently rely on companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the Mal@@ ware @-@ defense specialists of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , some repeatedly victims of an attack with black@@ mailing software . &quot;
nearly 20 per cent of companies have already been the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware ext@@ or@@ tion .
40 percent of victims paid by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators demanded by the challenged systems and data to be used again .
the offen@@ ders speci@@ alise their al@@ pres@@ ser software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in corporate networks .
they have been successful there for the potentially in@@ pressing sol@@ vent significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of damage software , &quot; explained Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then we discovered the perpetrators of ext@@ or@@ tion software for itself .
only private user did not use the target ; but the change to reg@@ att@@ acken went very rapidly over the past few months .
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on the computer of an offering , it is specifically looking for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives photos and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als lasting .
&quot; afterwards , the software presents the demands of the pres@@ pres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the files to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where with private users , the personal photo database is at stake , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is still stagn@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls off if a ran@@ som@@ ware fails . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the companies affected by German firms by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to fully inter@@ rupt the business , in a case human beings were killed . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , many hospitals have been victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of sick@@ le . &quot;
&quot; we always say the victims always : paying not , you thereby promotes the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of firms which pay , get their data again . &quot;
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of offen@@ ders in operation .
the h@@ ackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure has examined user experience and get in contact with the investig@@ ators and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files . &quot;
&quot; and will people be rede@@ emed after payments of a few hundred euros , businesses have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ dig@@ it sums in order to reg@@ ain their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risk of risk of the Ran@@ som@@ ware ext@@ or@@ tion , the h@@ ackers are always professional and sharing the work , explains the safety expert ch@@ ni@@ ewski of anti @-@ virus scanner : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , however , is that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their claim software then in the form of a software design to the actual mis@@ press .
&quot; the existing Mal@@ ware kits were created by the Mal@@ ware themselves , consulting and additional tools for a unique , permanent price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in scope is a adapt@@ ability tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and brand@@ ing can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the black@@ out are then looking for more h@@ ackers to distribute the newly bought software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so one log@@ ged in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal , and commissioned another , to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per in@@ consistent machine .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then wear sp@@ amm@@ ers with the circulation , &quot; explained Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that make their data better .
over 50 per cent of companies @-@ IT @-@ entities in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on the ranking Ran@@ som@@ ware using File @-@ Back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not pose a sufficient threat to successful income , the offen@@ ders is instead explained by the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the damage potential is still much higher than that of the data is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetrators will be able to use completely new objectives on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers , as they could get with the Internet connected thermo@@ stat under their control . &quot;
in the middle of winter the free@@ switching of such a block heating might well be worth a ran@@ som .
&quot; if the perpet@@ r@@ ator rather than the heating in the future is a whole production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a subject in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all accounts
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little Cou@@ p@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty crowded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , passengers have a lot in the first row and in the catch a lot of space , it does not work closely at any point . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit side falls off there . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage room .
&quot; it is not only available with a trunk of 45@@ 3 l for high @-@ up and 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , than it sounds : the sitting area of the back@@ seat can be high @-@ holes as arm@@ chairs and thus offer storage space , which is high from the floor up to blankets 1,@@ 24 m . &quot;
&quot; the trunk @-@ room is well loaded , however , the char@@ ger with 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; the tested 1.6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm , into large @-@ speed ranges , very powerful . &quot;
&quot; however , he is likely to give up his work a little qui@@ eter . &quot;
this is the price of all day @-@ to @-@ day abuse of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another motor@@ ization : a 1.5 @-@ l gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
all @-@ cycle @-@ drive is not offered .
&quot; driving is well @-@ balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
&quot; however , the steering is likely to be a little direct . &quot;
the equipment is made available in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes un@@ fulfilled .
&quot; among the safety systems , the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ isions war@@ n@@ system and the don@@ tal assistant . &quot;
the coll@@ isions sometimes irrit@@ ated because he evaluated many obstacles in the rank@@ ings as &quot; her@@ edit@@ ary objects . &quot;
very reliable operates the e @-@ service assistant .
and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ ter is responding to the traffic detection and d@@ ros@@ selt to speed the speed .
&quot; however , the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are a little bit aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well equipped top diesel diesel ters are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , the gas@@ oline will receive from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 car@@ bure@@ au .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday comfort . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall in the air bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the air bridge .
&quot; because a liability is conceivable only in haz@@ ards , which are typical of the air traffic , argu@@ ed the upper district of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had been broken with the fall of a knee br@@ ace .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the Court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage .
disease case : when paid the organizer
&quot; after their trip , holi@@ day@@ makers get only money back after their journey , if the cause of the disease is dubi@@ ous free in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; that is only then the case , if more than ten percent of guests have proven the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case , a family was hard on the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ oise @-@ lau@@ bs heavily of diar@@ rhe@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
it spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
your condition led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a faul@@ ty brack@@ et back that supposedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
&quot; the family was the view , the journey would have been lacking - and def@@ endant against the organizer . &quot;
in court the bat had no success .
though the pl@@ aster was in fact def@@ ective .
but the organizer was just before leaving the r@@ ack@@ ets .
he had to assume until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he has not viol@@ ated his information duties , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since in the samples of the water no contam@@ ination were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by connecting with each other - belonging to the general risk of life .
from 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 erk@@ r@@ ens .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that in accordance with the refugees of refugees in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people would have worry about further attacks .
the state had n@@ uns and decided at the same time to counter terrorism .
it is certain that our country will not answer the force of the perpetrators with hat@@ red and split .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this triumph , we will not give the terrorists . &quot;
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country , but the level of security and strength is also the consent of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère will achieve a implementation of the proposals until the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced a further personnel strengthening of security forces , namely &quot; &quot; in Middle @-@ earth size order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism should be placed under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weapon is so novel@@ ty , that especially the purchase of weapons will be complicated in the internet . &quot;
the last much discussed silence @-@ light for doctors is supposed to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ères .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the doctors still wants to seek solutions , such as the threat of citizens could be less@@ ened , he said with view about mental al@@ lig@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter a radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support to be necessary . &quot;
teacher would have to be better prepared for the handling of traum@@ atis@@ ed people .
for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the internet ( Dark@@ net ) is planning to be used by Ma@@ izi@@ ère the use of contrac@@ tu@@ ters .
&quot; SPD @-@ boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to improving security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior have clearly spoken against action . &quot;
&quot; this was one ear for the sni@@ pe in CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel the papers of Fun@@ ke ME@@ DI@@ ENG@@ RU@@ P@@ PE ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ iz@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban , and the abolition of the double nationality . &quot;
a general pro@@ hibition of full @-@ encryp@@ ting it is problematic for constitu@@ tionally problematic .
&quot; you cannot see everything you re@@ jects , and I Leh@@ ne the traction of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
talking about rules about traffic or for witnesses in court .
green @-@ Chief of Simone Peter threw the Minister before , he wants to simul@@ ate new anti @-@ terror log@@ gers and scope of action . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ party ste@@ ep@@ ef Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet of che@@ ating and a tigh@@ tening of the residence to the right will not bring people more security in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow on the Motor@@ way br@@ inger
it &apos;s a regular basis on the road here - here &apos;s a picture of November .
&quot; however , that should change : the rule of law shall be prolonged . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all motor@@ cyclists who stand in the work traffic on the ambient road every night in the St@@ au , if they drive over the highway toll road ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road construction is extended on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 . / 17 . August ) , in the area between the hammer street and the departure Wes@@ eler road the Right ab@@ bi@@ al track at 700 meters . &quot;
car drivers can then take directly from the hammer street on the right .
&quot; the major advantage : the traffic shares early on , thus reducing the overall performance on the multi @-@ way section of the federal highway 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea of the extended exit had the CD@@ U Group in the district , representing Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the driving force on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is annoying the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days extends from the way back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond .
&quot; reason , the needle @-@ cave is located on the B 51 just before the departure of the &quot; &quot; Wes@@ eler Straße &quot; . &quot; &quot;
from here the traffic will only be guided through the motorway bridge .
the second trace had to be recovered from a well @-@ three years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge has no longer the necessary bearing force , in order to take advantage of heavy @-@ duty transport . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated working stand will last , the local state can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , it is expected to reck@@ on with years : for the bridge has an official date of resi@@ ding until the year 2034 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal stress of the country , the provincial operation has deliberately picked up the busi@@ er time in the school holidays because with disabilities be expected . &quot;
traffic will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday at the site of the site .
inter @-@ cultural tour : cultural activities for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s Association permits young people with a migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has been presenting a presentation of the award winning song &quot; The Inv@@ isible House &quot; of the Young Theatre in Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the club N@@ ima &apos;s initiatives , 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the little house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association has set up the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , giving schools with welcome groups , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people of the class were born between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and a little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the sz@@ en@@ ic pictures and video animations , it would have been possible to follow the scope of action , so the press release of the Young Theatre in Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from Spr@@ ak@@ el , and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will be able to visit professionally in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the the@@ atri@@ cal and the@@ atri@@ cal language skills are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
&quot; given the increasing refugee is counting the association with many classes , who wish to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star @-@ snow sheds : hope to we@@ aving the weather
&quot; the weather has made the star @-@ beak @-@ cast , in the south @-@ west Germany during the night to Friday a walk through the invoice - but there is still hope . &quot;
&quot; the night was badly suitable for clouds and rain , the sky of the observ@@ atory puppy , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night for Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we certainly see many stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; with the stars , Per@@ sei@@ den , which are with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the quick@@ est gra@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they seem to come from the constell@@ ation Per@@ se@@ us , which is in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , one gets eternal around , at night one is standing for hours in the morning , in the morning there is no more sleep in the morning before wak@@ ing up . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , there is such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adults troubles and more than ten percent gain their sleep frequently or permanently being recovered . &quot;
how do sleep problems or in@@ bed@@ ding ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many causes underlying , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , Secretary @-@ member of the German Society for dormit@@ ories and medicine . &quot;
&quot; but what one understands that is , but the In@@ som@@ nie , therefore an in@@ kling and a sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; at the same time many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , J@@ ens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , pres@@ ch@@ et@@ eri@@ or in the German household medical association with practice in the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of bed@@ dys@@ functions are complex .
&quot; organic , mental or even @-@ related factors , but also drugs are stuck . &quot;
not rarely is the in@@ trouble expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early wak@@ ing up is often associated with depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it can be that several factors bed@@ ding each other .
&quot; who for example has a Band@@ shell case , can be bad , w@@ acht every two to three hours and begins wan@@ ing to greet you day problems and make sure there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when to eat with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; who will not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week , and the day is com@@ promised , should go to the doctor , betra@@ ys We@@ came . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment may vary quite differently : it is be@@ aten , tired , un@@ exploited , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood fluctu@@ ations or bodily gri@@ ev@@ ances like stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in order to all@@ evi@@ ate the in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , it is important to find out the causes . &quot;
&quot; as therapy options , among other things about behavi@@ oral changes , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping @-@ tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; in Germany there is hardly anything in Germany , the Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in sleeping @-@ problems , one should first contact the primary care physician , then we@@ ave . &quot;
this may clarify whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go in sleep and what happens there ?
&quot; to examine in the sleep laboratory medical case , for example , by snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory disorders , in sleeping @-@ fatigue or if one does not find the cause of a m@@ sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ine , explained Fi@@ etze . &quot;
it is actually not necessary to prepare for the study .
you should have the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch @-@ sheep , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the dri@@ lls one goes to his normal time into bed .
&quot; beside the electro@@ des in the body you are carrying a nose @-@ bri@@ g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a ant@@ enn@@ as on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera draws to the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can people affected the problems get a grip on ?
there are quite a lot of different suits where you can bet for a better sleep .
&quot; thr@@ ust counts on : regular sleeping @-@ time and post@@ ings , not too long in bed , not to sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol at night and at night don &apos;t start at the watch - then you begin to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with lack of medals in swimming has to be
the former German swimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself by Facebook to dis@@ appoint the D@@ SV &apos;s team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he took gold for the first time in Doha at the same time and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ l@@ und Markus Dei@@ bler submitted its own in the criticism of the ex @-@ team colleagues .
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ asi@@ eger 20,000 € rewards and a jun@@ k € 15@@ 0.000 € should not be surprised about missing medals , the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Friday at his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ ing controls very well . &quot;
&quot; this way , we cannot compete with countries which will promote a lot and do not see exactly the topic of dop@@ ing , or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here controls will be dis@@ continued , &quot; &quot; stated he continued . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler had already registered nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; anyone who cannot be controlled with a certain amount of time before World Cup / OS of independent contro@@ l@@ le@@ uren from the W@@ ada / fin@@ a must not participate , &quot; demands the choice of Hamburg , who has now been running a Eis@@ di@@ ele . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de from Pl@@ astic Bag
professional dive at the airport Düsseldorf
civilian re@@ por@@ ters of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years old .
the Tatra people had committed to a ban@@ de several pick@@ po@@ - and baggage bag .
&quot; at 9@@ 30 pm , civil officials were known in the field of the airport Düsseldorf a ban@@ de , which was known for the polic@@ emen from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July this year and were a collaborative , working class and particularly professionally . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ate 34 can show the thi@@ eves that were assigned to the Com@@ missions of crimes to Germany , four acts . &quot;
&quot; they had a total of more than 15,000 Euro . &quot;
&quot; old house buildings , a few lenses , inter@@ viewed by still a rest of head@@ stone : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in acts at first glance not so , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; to the west , one goes along the street from east to the west , one gets to play places , a refreshing kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
to the facade of a gray house someone has become ugly !
&quot; opposite to a Li@@ dl , which is also soon to be demol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rentals adver@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in the past few weeks , articles about this &quot; tr@@ en@@ during district &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate agent was reported in the last weeks , but are preferred by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , we have had the residents of lease , on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year H@@ enk@@ el had spoken many times for a hard procedure of the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomy . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , according to 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , block parts of the street and visited visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile renovated construction workers on behalf of the un@@ familiar land@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on July 13 , a Berlin administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal and one day later the police and buil@@ ders under the rejo@@ icing of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer morning , the road takes place peaceful : parents walk along with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ t@@ ained bro@@ adly . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are elementary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main or@@ ge of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the area since 1999 and Jana * who are here three children here , are mostly of the police presence . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising packages and g@@ entri@@ fication .
it does not sound after a Kie@@ z who wished to say himself multiple police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ous left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , that of the Berlin inter@@ state , and the police between the occup@@ ants and their neighbours , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; in the east of Berlin , a traditional workers &quot; country in the east was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which also has a low average of resistance to the rest of the city and have high poverty in poverty . &quot;
&quot; also home@@ work and the resulting housing projects have already been occupied for a long time : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the main@@ zer had been cleared under large police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the quarter in recent years has increasingly become the magn@@ ets for tourists and elec@@ toral liner from all over the world : with them now inhabitants of the GDR @-@ times and former house poss@@ essed its area . &quot;
&quot; this also makes it noticeable in the hi@@ ring , which has risen almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them on the rec@@ alled dis@@ cs or newly removed fac@@ ades that have been ej@@ ected using color .
no other street was often mentioned so often with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence &quot; .
&quot; a reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences like bodily injury are based almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the largest part of criminal off@@ ences are made of atomic facts , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the disp@@ uted 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for non @-@ violence , it is compul@@ sory : the people in the 94 are their neighbours that would not have been . &quot;
the famous burning cars also give it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er even longer .
&quot; for the studied architect , their street is not a criminal burning point , on the contrary , &quot; &quot; Here you can help each other , lives together on the street and gets more from one another , than wo@@ unded . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn into the rig@@ a@@ er street - and stayed .
&quot; it was therefore also so important that the residen@@ ces left their street : from the police , politics and the media , in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July . &quot;
&quot; however , in the eyes of the residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to move away : in the face @-@ less re @-@ buildings in former buildings , which impose the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ um apartments , which are not interesting for many here - here more people who are not as well @-@ called , &quot; says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction cannot be upgraded . &quot;
but what should one do if someone listen to someone ?
&quot; we put it on all sides of frustration , even at the police and the residents . &quot;
&quot; for aggreg@@ ated , who likes to say about color bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the area . &quot;
&quot; who came up , should be aware of it - just like someone who draws into a pub that can complain badly about noise . &quot;
all those who have been asked with the name of the names are asked not to be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organization .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker on site . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le the Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of the management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees himself as a contact for all players : refugees , labour @-@ in refugee assistance , administr@@ ators , authorities and who else else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working price indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the viable w@@ ron@@ g@@ il@@ it@@ ans , which especially has a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less sp@@ ott@@ ingly as much as the multitude of wish points are targeted , as the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; he was looking for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a viable w@@ ron@@ age . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people on site and also behind the scenes , as well as network insp@@ ections . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been doing for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place for a period of three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Kunde that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ orary and full @-@ official players supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon there will be a new container in Was@@ hing .
&quot; a grave problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for connecting wi@@ gs have been acknowledged . &quot;
&quot; for the connection , the municipalities are responsible . &quot;
they must accommodate refugees in their own or log@@ ged spaces .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the commun@@ es themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the countryside and the Comm@@ une and J@@ ob@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search for some time has been very difficult for some time .
the administration may not find private apartments .
&quot; so far it doesn &apos;t work so far you may rely on private apartments , so Th@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore must be shared apartments , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , soon new containers are placed in the washing street . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , the Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to permanent lead , there are train@@ e@@ eship , training places , training places , a @-@ euro jobs and assistance assistance for refugees and migrants that must be found or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Client . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home ma@@ ins , do non @-@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , such as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive out@@ impact .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day need a fixed structure , say d@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of relatives .
&quot; so , there are offers like sport , contacts with natives and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are pure .
so they also jump to administration and hon@@ orary posts .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they need to declare the refugees that it takes time and they can make the time sensible , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach anyone could not work and be useless , which will never be integrated into Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the distinct majority is motivated .
&quot; however , there is also a client , &quot; &quot; says honestly , &quot; &quot; people where nothing works . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer was therefore always to motiv@@ ate others too . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do you have a difficult question : do you feel afraid of radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; what some na@@ ï@@ ve may call &quot; &quot; a Res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko &quot; &quot; but would not want to exclu@@ de it . &quot;
the hel@@ per should be sensi@@ ti@@ zed but already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
&quot; they would have the fear that the ass@@ ass@@ ay made them completely in call . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with that , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so he must hold the main and hon@@ orary offices in the region and in the region according to activities .
&quot; they have always in the background , that soon a new thr@@ ust of refugees and migrants might come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a ceiling ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the politics shy . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put it on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there , where we would go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already artic@@ ulated , so that the Ur@@ bacher are already able to integrate it reasonably . &quot;
&quot; this is currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political situation is so complicated , there is no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : sing@@ le@@ aking with helic@@ opter looked
the police helic@@ opter flew about one hour long different areas - un@@ successful .
two un@@ known men are penet@@ rated on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 p.m. in an apartment in an apartment house in the lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants struck the two and hit the b@@ hol@@ de into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1.70 meters large , probably mas@@ ked , both Blu@@ e@@ je@@ ans and black Cap@@ u@@ zen@@ lis . &quot;
they escap@@ ed from the city center .
&quot; to the pl@@ us@@ ement , the police put several stri@@ ps , as well as a police helic@@ opter . &quot;
the reason@@ ing went without success .
&quot; possibly , the unknown before the apartment fell near the apartment or with their flight . &quot;
