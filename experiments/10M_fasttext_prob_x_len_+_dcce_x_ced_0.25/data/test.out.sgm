<seg id="11">He was able to guide himself with his family through the complex of the ALRV on a horse he didn't even stand out to photograph.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was the first time in Aachen and with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was really convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports assistance handed over the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala gills the Goldene Sporide.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in addition, it lacks the sympathetic athlete."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundeswehr, silnes Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps policies in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP to prevent both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"unfortunately, the two US presidential system are at the EC- and Energy Policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a principled, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">Thinking about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">The trump will hold the doubt rather small and warns how the state of the economy can harm - with tax and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to put the economy to death and regulators," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"on the other hand, it would be quite different, claims penmp."</seg>
<seg id="9">"it will be driven by regulations, and he makes for a long-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to meet, he has disadvantaged opportunities to open and need money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes would increase in the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the nuts, Trump and Clinton will say almost wortalike."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic Applicants announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes into the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly adhered to by the nationalistic Teaparty wing of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there are still partial internal discussions on the Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">More evident are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal fired power plants and re-drive the coal production in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil promotion shall also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to terminate it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton wants to explicitly expand and asks the renewable energies with its Investment Program:" "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazifish Trade Agreement, do both want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US do not want to isolate the US trade - but just American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"this will then be better paid, for about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump is to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be down, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump is given to boost the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics hold him before, so that the household deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton concluded that at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes and their critics are saying, more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "for Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire is clear on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan requires first and foremost all friends who can get after spending last month at a failed coup d'etétat almost of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions made Turkey tough - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>

<seg id="38">"furthermore, the continued grouping over the Snail of EU accession talks and Putin - the piping is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the west."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of State in Ankara won a bonus for Ankara that he sought after the tried coup d "état for elected government bodies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of self-understandably for Moscow, which itself has a deep-sitting fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey, one as it meant to me an analytical once described," alliance of aliens. "two countries that have been violated from the West and will now exert themselves."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two still."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently given the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey can aid opposing parties."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after nearly three hours of the first talks on the press conference, they didn't want the issue to have been striped."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the president of Turkey avoided it intentionally to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>

<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to bring about 30 minutes to take" "from the sofa" "and" "to be active" "every day, because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller substrates its immune system and Würgereflex a serious examination - by doing some of the narrower and ekelest places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"moderator and travel chief Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk chased his part on a Euro-Schein, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before the check-up of each object, he used an Luminometer to show up and show us what he will get."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was recorded under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, to reject the rinsb of a draw toilette that was already used by thousands of others, but actually are in a kitchen sink more poor bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of bowel bacteria, as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he put it, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestine, coming through the world and having a peculiar, as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations up to dishwashers of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"he told me:" "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and slate water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was fair to his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he derided was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its trial-line showed an Luminometernum from over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometerm is freshly woven hands less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to reject after their Luminometeriscent over 4000 units were, while freshly saw hands less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the movie "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "that comes the worst of what I have matured in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing short of dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will see nothing here because it is here inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company contains Mr. Wright with Valio Wilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of bowel bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "we really wanted the consumer to offer something new."</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we led mad brainstormings by, which we ended, that we said" Let us call us Ian. "</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary this allows us to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala that resulted in the direction of the film, added:" "let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had learned some of the things which I have relied to him, like the ekelous Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, things were simpler, when it was simpler to bring Ian Gillan, she anzulously and others, with which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in one of Valio conducted survey from the year 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they are at least stored occasionally, the lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">Deserted men middle aged records.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you go out to the commentary box to sowing it under the pseudonym non-collaged men-aged men with rust insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multiplication of sound plates is not due to a boom in millennials, who wish to welcome the curiosity of physical objects but to be attributed to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all predicting after between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer.</seg>
<seg id="7">"it is also not a hordes through hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older record restists keep their feelings more likely to spend (56% vs. 53%), and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%)."</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog is a news report on television, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soho bad, a modest crusade to wear and wild siloere before I steeping, my hands hold and somewhat determinate how:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Sohos is slowly located to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling up the buildings in which once independent seller located - are still a handful of fantastic turntables."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera to the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and stud by watching.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I made by Sister Ray (data number: eight men middle age) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably about the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, question I?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate it," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="17">"this sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I am not followed by him), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: he is now able to buy records as they appeared and once again to buy items that he sold, when he was young and bankrupt."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things that I buy, are published from the late sixties, early 70s, which was published, when I was 11 or 12. things that I probably was anything to young to buy it," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who are buying plates, rather introverted and gladly spend time, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't eat much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my push-buttons.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meet the YouGov Profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people that will be influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and let themselves be led to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually got around 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, sell now their CDs to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the record-revised of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica, to recognize that record stores provides a soothing community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contact-contact payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of trusted silattendants from objects to faint hitative cheeships.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it may be the feeding of a void or the property of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is true with me as collectors so and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "a staff of a record stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people bought a record, they have not yet heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy one record, not record a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while using a stack to Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle aged men), has noticed a" trophy "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only here purely and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radicalf record, so that I can put it into the shelf. "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">"more producritically, less music clams."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people, who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older, who only slow to come."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience, than I would go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the pre-standing shops - Wild Beasts New Words and sexters Pop instead of experimental jazz chooses among the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but nagging psychological traumata are hard-adjustable when you stand beside someone thirty seconds long."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, run around in the shop for a few minutes and look at the variance of the plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more likely to be a manneal gland than a large one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, so the collecting of records is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of records is... it drives with a loved sigh."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, by which it is said that a new generation of turntables should be inspired: urban slfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the semblance that jeans-hotts, I observe a group of young teenager, who voted for a moment to think about polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a stairwell, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics that essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees her - perhaps because they are merely purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to address them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record-art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is most for luxury items like plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research inquiries made that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in records in Soho, the great number of female collectors and record-holders who exist in reality, plate-juices and in online-forks, incalculating."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not to walk through the plate of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they irritate the starving view of an unfurtive, 30-year false moderator over the shoulders of no longer middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"one day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 winner of Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans have won 3-0."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman's warm with dimples, could quite be sent under these famous names which would be sent to Prime Time, built through sponsors and well-being TV advertisement, if he would be a swimmer, Turner or even a real."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the olympic trampolines around gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not cover any event alike.</seg>

<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may be rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I might make humbly arguments for my particular darling, then let me direct the attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline."</seg>

<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on the trampoline has a certain outdoor charms, partly because it sounds suitable for the unresolved ear for a ClownsSchool as the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a blindness enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never wanting to end tunnels - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and docking that combines two sports that are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as the springboard."</seg>

<seg id="28">"the targeted striving is posh, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator."</seg>

<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to come together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid composite of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government the land and spread out into ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people on the streets were slowed down political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses passed on that policemen were on zig unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation-well-being videos about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year are to show how vulnerabilities are young people with pegs, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN High Authority on Human Rights is now calling for a more-depth examination.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to meet this country and in future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa to Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopian forces to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands in the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pectin in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia has been anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations, the opposition in the country was led by the government - the opposition in the country was reduced, whereby dissidents were effective."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many have been sent into exile or into prison, or in the walls of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks off," said Seyoutube Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth are protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments that cover all from ground use until the stranglehold imposed in terms of power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widespread choice last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this tender, controversial line demanded in June hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden which were more or less forced to benefit the turbulence over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why emotions of bitterness after years of the bite under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians had been able to communicate with social media because cheap smartphones have been more frequent and improved the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government gives access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies which conceal where they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians added that they were so many people gathered together.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mainly Christian high-countries, in the politics and the economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims live and live in flat land areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are thereby to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in military services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebellion of rebellion, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that it was particularly reverted to use early signs of dissatisfaction and special officers, to edit opponents and make them inharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime is lacking in this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict of conflict. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unattainable reasons to assume the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts are saying that he does not enjoy the confidence that he obtained from the Tigray provides controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time, Ethiopia has been living in such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections were protracted according to the analyst and subsequently stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following sweeps many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months, and that time of unrest passed relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts in Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new pendant move, as well as for their measurable progress on fighting poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month's protesters in gondar, an amharish city, from Tigray-shops and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more widespread in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts are saying that the protests of the USA and other Western allies are able to position a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though they have recently investigated that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to support democracy, he will not want his foamed in a already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin waving."</seg>

<seg id="5">"after having made the distinction during an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump had made with respect to the claim on Thursday and existed in interviews that he really does not intended to argue that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning on Friday Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was opposed to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump would help to weaken the statement a bit off by reading him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him, the Republican Ukrainian presidential didacy did not know about it."</seg>

<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself, when he said, the Russians should hear Mrs. Clintons's emails, but he said later" Natasha "I said the sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then move back to your needs.</seg>

<seg id="17">But I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>

<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist who was published on Friday, a tour with great lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-head-head in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump has generally tried to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often blame his critics to conceal his statements or falsifying his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal co-faith in the inconvenient situation, regardless of how provocative might be his statements also."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps prominent intercessors, gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani said to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had formed the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that Barack Obama was an almost unfamiliar, small organization, he called her backslider, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government served under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as a foreign minister, it accepted ISIS allowed to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and cast them before, on each of his words, and to be taken against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he groaned the" poor, "Flemish" television experts who try to understand him and said, "" You can not! "" "</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raste last night at the Velodrom in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the Anchorage, who had made his Landsmann Sir Chris Hoy and made the legend that he stormed a victory of the favourites New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">England four years ago claimed a shocking victory in Hoy the fifth of six Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took place in March at the Rail World Championships in London despite the return of Hoys only a modest square.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a result.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap to close the kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they remained when they saw the potential in the villi that now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hiny, Kenny - the winner of four years ago with Hoy and Skinner sat down in the qualification round a Olympiarekord, but in the standarround round the New Zealets in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hindi was just back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner stopped."</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a huge part of the transformation from the execution in a higher gear to decelerate it and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to hold the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert, and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they were on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," It is a flattering comparison. "</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make myself a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have put up a Olympiarekord and the world leaders have defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph of 2012 at the Kennys and Hoys, Hinder gave to him that he fell intentionally to the railway after a weak start."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned that statement later and there was no objection of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an amazing victory there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hindu said," It feels like the whole GB Flags on the Tribunes like London. "</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible again to win at the Olympiad again.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were seven of ten titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days at the Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is in the area of possible that he is repeated the victory of three olympic gold medals in a contest."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be born for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, which was also born on 23 March (a apparently sacred date for the British sport; on the day also Steve Editgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister was born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes place next in the sprint which begins today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels something lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Hindu said," If he wins two further gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medallists of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified himself with the quickest performance in the four-four miles running."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the destination.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won in London gold in 2012, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition, at the Wiggins, with certainty."</seg>
<seg id="42">He had trapped yesterday with officers in front of the qualification as him tracked to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the appropriate women contest, the morning continued and ended, avanced Laura Dest, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archiving in Weltrekordera in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a sary of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio has been rundown.</seg>
<seg id="46">"it also played drama in the background, so the resignation of the Technical Chief Shane Sutton in April in the middle of sexism and bullying, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one sees the first evening of competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite like that could be the now legendary reputation GBs that has reached its peak at the perfect moment."</seg>

<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be jeopardized at a closing.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to dominoeffect as the melting is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias."</seg>

<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the agreements were called" "fuse services", "which would have entered into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month period of cancellation so that they may end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"thus AGL is assuming that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue," said the electricity supplies. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All the potential impact on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong operating markets for major retail prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL shared with that the value of the Treaties was already written in the year of $187 million in" "anticipation of an cancellation." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to make the Trecoas to operate the" "Alcoas" "or to guarantee the power supply to the melting". ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"the U.S. company said that there will be a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would like to enter into force one year later, even if there is still a statement why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts were warn because of the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago complex near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of the analyst in the early week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland use approximately 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of Errors-Malware currently rely on companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the Malware-defense specialists of Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, some repeatedly victims of an attack with blackmailing software."</seg>
<seg id="4">Nearly 20 per cent of companies have already been the target of a ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of victims paid by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators demanded by the challenged systems and data to be used again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The offenders specialise their alpresser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">They have been successful there for the potentially inpressing solvent significantly higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of damage software," explained Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the perpetrators of extortion software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private user did not use the target; but the change to regattacken went very rapidly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once on the computer of an offering, it is specifically looking for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives photos and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">"afterwards, the software presents the demands of the prespresser."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the files to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where with private users, the personal photo database is at stake, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is still stagnant."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls off if a ransomware fails."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the companies affected by German firms by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to fully interrupt the business, in a case human beings were killed."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, many hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of sickle."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say the victims always: paying not, you thereby promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of firms which pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of offenders in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure has examined user experience and get in contact with the investigators and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct support websites or decrypt free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will people be redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, businesses have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to regain their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risk of risk of the Ransomware extortion, the hackers are always professional and sharing the work, explains the safety expert chniewski of anti-virus scanner:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"more likely, however, is that it is about three or four people."</seg>

<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year Henkel had spoken many times for a hard procedure of the police against the project, the area called" No-Go-Zone "for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomy."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, according to 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, block parts of the street and visited visitors from entering the house with number 94."</seg>

<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main orge of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the area since 1999 and Jana * who are here three children here, are mostly of the police presence."</seg>

<seg id="5">The social pedagogy supports the team of the management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"she sees himself as a contact for all players: refugees, labour-in refugee assistance, administrators, authorities and who else else."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the working price indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the viable wrongilitans, which especially has a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so, some - less spottingly as much as the multitude of wish points are targeted, as the administration wanted to write the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he was looking for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just a viable wronage."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people on site and also behind the scenes, as well as network inspections."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been doing for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place for a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Kunde that Annika Deuschle honorary and full-official players supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there will be a new container in Washing.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a grave problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for connecting wigs have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">"for the connection, the municipalities are responsible."</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate refugees in their own or logged spaces.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the communes themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the countryside and the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">The administration may not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far it doesn't work so far you may rely on private apartments, so Theuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore must be shared apartments, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, soon new containers are placed in the washing street."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, the Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to permanent lead, there are traineeship, training places, training places, a-euro jobs and assistance assistance for refugees and migrants that must be found or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Client. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help home mains, do non-profit work - and this motivates and very neat, such as Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive outimpact.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a fixed structure, say deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of relatives.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, there are offers like sport, contacts with natives and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are pure.</seg>
<seg id="40">So they also jump to administration and honorary posts.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome and welcome in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they need to declare the refugees that it takes time and they can make the time sensible, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling, he could not help in Urbach anyone could not work and be useless, which will never be integrated into Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, there is also a client," "says honestly," "people where nothing works." the work of Deuschle and customer was therefore always to motivate others too. "</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do you have a difficult question: do you feel afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "Regine customer says quite clearly," "what some naïve may call" "a Restrisiko" "but would not want to exclude it."</seg>
<seg id="50">The helper should be sensitized but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">"they would have the fear that the assassay made them completely in call." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with that," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So he must hold the main and honorary offices in the region and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">"they have always in the background, that soon a new thrust of refugees and migrants might come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the politics shy."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put it on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived there, where we would go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already articulated, so that the Urbacher are already able to integrate it reasonably."</seg>
<seg id="63">"this is currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political situation is so complicated, there is no simple answers."</seg>
