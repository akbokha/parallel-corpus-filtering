Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not straight @-@ friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teh@@ er@@ ans dest@@ abil@@ ising action in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , it should also be concerned about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ states solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington den@@ ies the ongoing sett@@ ling of Israel and poses a lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the Obama &apos;s premi@@ er deal around Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu has held a cont@@ enti@@ ous speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans in front of the US Congress , which was marked as an af@@ front against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech had not been dismis@@ sed with Obama , a meeting had im@@ pris@@ oned this with reference to the pending election in Israel . &quot;
in a call @-@ call Professor to have shot his girlfriend
&quot; in an emergency , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on &apos;s represented with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that he had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; he was represented to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ ad@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that I wanted , I could do it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that he had traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Mississippi which has already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was killed and killed on the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ v@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all the university staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he made the fatal emergency @-@ call for some time after that .
&quot; until the end of the day there was a further death : Lamb , when the police took him . &quot;
&quot; after spending a day after the shooting at the University , the students and lectur@@ ers to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what he motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details that were published by the investig@@ ators in both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff members , who knew him , helped create an image of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students say they were looking forward to their teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ ge , where he died , he said , did not have any history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; he has represented himself in one of his book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his ak@@ ade@@ mis@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; both judged in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty are 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations at the problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers which he praised , he also seemed a bit excited and nervous , as if something with him was wrong . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lam@@ b told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; he has previously requested the Delta State University for health reasons , and said that he had any problems whatsoever . &quot;
this year he signed only two online courses .
&quot; recent amendments in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion has been working so hard for him , for him , no guarantee for an automatic path to a defined as assistant professor would represent . &quot;
&quot; teacher William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between represented and Schmidt , but &quot; of course , there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot;
these are questions that can no longer be able to answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs , when he returned to Mississippi from Ark@@ ansas . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , sl@@ bra@@ sted with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran even at the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lamb goes to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
he grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 he began his work at the University , the 3.@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and has prepared geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he went in the spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the many years old friend@@ bs celebrated him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 , when she met through mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game . &quot;
he was then the Frau@@ ensch@@ warm .
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted that when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and ru@@ mp were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to one Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said , they were retired 15 years ago , but friends were stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was completely destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; &apos; Ste@@ en said he has never met he , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and played music . &quot;
he met Sk@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both at a summer festival three years ago .
later they played together one or another .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ ab@@ ss was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sh@@ af@@ fer , a Bar@@ ke@@ eper and sometimes enter@@ tain@@ er Co@@ ordinator at The Ju@@ ep Room , a weak spot@@ lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he met he &apos;s Lamb and Pr@@ ab@@ pp Night in the night 5 September , after he ended up his guitar and harmon@@ i@@ ons before a sp@@ icy audience . &quot;
there was no indication that something that was not voting .
&quot; just a lucky couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we stayed at the end of the end and jo@@ k@@ ish with each other .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester and specialized in American indigenous people and colonial story , said Don All@@ an Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at school . &quot;

this is a day of healing .

&quot; associated Press Author Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans tru@@ sts to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that he made supp@@ er of the call , and that lam@@ b has stated his not@@ e@@ er earlier than his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever been married . &quot;

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als and I noticed that the seat is beside me empty , and it will gradually realize that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;

&quot; UN leader says , there is no military solution in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Secretary General of K@@ i @-@ Moon says , his answer to Russia has increased military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of almost five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader also calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support an inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;

8 re@@ ques@@ tioning assets indicate that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious about .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; however , no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to drag Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks at surveys , it has ( yet ) not working . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys , Donald Tru@@ mp showed at the two @-@ dig@@ it range , and some start to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
none asser@@ ted that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership has been passed on to the ascen@@ ding Herman C@@ ain , none of whom did not win a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like J@@ ief Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now identify Tru@@ mp@@ s per@@ sever@@ ance and start to let their dollars flow in order to overthrow him .
&quot; here are some current survey values , which suggest that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a tran@@ sit@@ ory phase : &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s Pop@@ ular values have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten republi@@ cans looked positively . &quot;
up to the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive opinion of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative feedback .
and these figures follow in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac adjustment in Io@@ wa has found last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion from Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with the Tru@@ mp as a candidate .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the republi@@ cans , they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say , they would be anno@@ yed , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , which said the same about Tru@@ mp &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the next in my enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ ef Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be a candidate . &quot;
a majority of Republi@@ cans sees Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and insul@@ ating statements , 52 percent of the Irish Republi@@ cans who have found the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first bi@@ op@@ tionally state of the nation , the federal state Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think he has the personality for a com@@ mander @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent believe that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his position and nearly six of 10 addi@@ cts say that his temper@@ ament did not fall into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they set up their capacity , Republi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp hold for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who , most likely the GO@@ P nom@@ ination wins , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
that is a change since the time when four out of ten end of July earned their money at Cal@@ eb .
complete reve@@ aling : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten republi@@ cans that Rick Per@@ ry would win nom@@ ination over just 28 % for the final Candi@@ dates Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters can view it as plau@@ si@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; even if the Republi@@ can gather around a different candidate , Tru@@ mp be@@ es almost everyone . &quot;
some experts suggest that the spl@@ itter box probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is diff@@ user more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical mind @-@ head @-@ race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp are har@@ ass@@ ent of majority support . &quot;
&quot; in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , Walker 15 points , before J@@ ef Bush 19 points and finally at the edge of Paul , John Ka@@ ze and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the business ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp @-@ fans say that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters want to support the Tru@@ mp , saying that they will forgive her votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot has happened to change this , and no one can truly say to change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they can keep the door open to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competition at the moment of other aliens , the neuro@@ surgeon &apos;s Ben Car@@ son , but voters that say they have their minds to be double so frequent for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say , they coinci@@ de with the Tru@@ mp in the issue of immigration . &quot;
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp was called &quot; &quot; Rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; in his election campaign , two months ago from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; was the immigration of the migration and ful@@ crum point in public discourse . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic inter@@ ruption of Tru@@ mp Com@@ pp@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans are distant from the Republi@@ can party and is sham@@ eful the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey from Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans speak that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp in case of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so as long as immigration remains in the lim@@ elight , it will also do the Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the frustration of the government clim@@ bed to new ables .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son exp@@ ires approximately half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all by their external status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in Io@@ wa earlier two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa republi@@ cans over the Republi@@ cans in Congress are frustr@@ ated with 54 percent &quot; unhappy and le@@ ased . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential people in Germany
here in the Bri@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential hotel - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , it costs a square meter apartment in the inc@@ ision of 73.@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt is the offer of objects quite limited , that is , in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter is the most cost .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces we arrive at one of the prices but as pe@@ anu@@ ts .
&quot; the property service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a list of exclusive German residential locations , square with square footage in narrow bo@@ ating heights . &quot;
&quot; there are several times of tens of thousands of Euro , and each square meter . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double @-@ fold go@@ al@@ arms in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the FC Bayern the way to a conden@@ ser 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ aus - then ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League &apos;s season .
the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have accused the FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pir@@ re@@ aus a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; .
the team of Trainer P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record Olympics at hot@@ spots ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9. ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th result in series is meant to be the first step in the finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy where guar@@ dian wants to finally catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received his prize at the Champions League for the co @-@ operation of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto which took one as fl@@ ange taken the shot of the universe .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , had promised Bavaria &apos;s captain Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis Stadium , before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner had thought . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated and dedicated vision , without sh@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his latest six home games in the Royal class , including against nam@@ ic clubs as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico , Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ Du@@ els were defeated with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
they went cour@@ ageous to be among them @-@ intensive efforts but often to be resour@@ c@@ eful to works .
the attacks were often led by rel@@ oc@@ ating on Link@@ aci@@ dic Douglas Costa , who per@@ ched against the previous Br@@ uns@@ wick Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Müller had left from the right more luck , when his fl@@ ange taken out of the right half @-@ field in the left top floor . &quot;
in the 63@@ th minute the World Champions gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first - as Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown the head ball of the Poland suggested by the line ( 26 ) .
&quot; then by director , the go@@ alie Roberto along with the knee par@@ ishes ( 3@@ 5. ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arian itself acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the dominant game , was able to so@@ ak needle pun@@ ches . &quot;
on Tor@@ ke@@ eper Manuel Neu@@ er was but Lost .
thus about as he added a shot of ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
&quot; recently brought Guardi@@ ola a quad@@ ru@@ ple with David Al@@ aba in the centre near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Götz@@ e , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ res , sitting first out there . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was given only after the final training given up light , he said Mr. Sam@@ mer with &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that is already vi@@ cious . &quot;
&quot; from the first change , Guardi@@ ola was decided against him when he brought to King@@ fis@@ ey Com@@ an for the an@@ thro@@ po@@ ison Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; i@@ dol rose late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) , and made 13 minutes later all clear , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller appointed a dr@@ on . &quot;
before the game it was at the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ alle .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly recorded Bavaria @-@ fans in their viewer @-@ block , the fans of hosted re@@ aus with words and ges@@ tures had prov@@ oked the security forces and went off with head@@ lines against the Mün@@ ch@@ ner trailer . &quot;
at least a Bavaria fan has been viol@@ ated from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , hence not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : for zi@@ cht the risk is fast .
smokers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this results from a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers lay in smoking the risk to lose their teeth , around the 2,5@@ - up to 3.6 @-@ times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major causes for dental fall , decay and inflamm@@ ations of the gin@@ gi@@ va , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
for these par@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor that emphasize the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore go back to most common g@@ um inflammation in smokers .
&quot; not clear , however , smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay . &quot;
&quot; people who c@@ eased with smoking may decrease their risk but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ard was back to the level of non @-@ smokers , told Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; man must convince people that are non @-@ smoking , the owner of H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking the age of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads after our findings also a good dental health to the high age .
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth decay have been affected by tooth decay . &quot;
previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early hair loss .
the new long @-@ term study em@@ bo@@ iling the findings .

they are to equal parts from the EU to the United States and from third countries .
it is for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; so far , the methods involved were involved with a refer@@ ee , a contradiction to them against their jud@@ g@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; during the recent months , it has become clear that citizens do not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , she wants to work according to his own details on a International Investment Court . &quot;
there could be clari@@ fied there for example between Chinese companies and EU states as well .
&quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration criteria applicable , above all , is considered to be one of the major reasons for the large resistance in Europe against the TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ration are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judicial authorities , about the company damage the tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act received the proposals by the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; cri@@ tici@@ zed has been cri@@ tici@@ zed especially , that they should not be considered for the already negotiated free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) . &quot;
the German economic state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) drew the plans on the other hand as a great progress .
&quot; the Commission considered the reform made essential points , the federal Minister of El@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;

&quot; when talks are completed for the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , on Wednesday it remained unclear . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since the middle of 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US however . &quot;
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is considered no more durable .
Del@@ ik@@ ater Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
ten years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; beside him , a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy voc@@ alist have recorded the picturesque US @-@ state Michigan with film @-@ stick . &quot;
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 persons , is almost taken in Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells them on the basis of various places , which he has always shown again on the map what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ster@@ ous and tender @-@ arranged songs report . &quot;
&quot; where they came up and what it looks like , in his homeland . &quot;
since then Stev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative boy .
&quot; with the 2003 release and third album &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; appearing wis@@ ely compact songs that sm@@ ates himself very close to American Folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time with great op@@ ul@@ ent dri@@ fting away . &quot;

&quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhine @-@ proximity , &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; appeared and breaks positive certain expectations . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ate at the issue of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut is expected with the issue of the Prime Minister with tension . &quot;
the new Labour president of Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut in the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister and to cooperate with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six pre @-@ given questions briefly after lunch while improving his performance by the media and the Labour Party themselves .
he called &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; during this week &apos;s event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p several sessions to leave their colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , for she comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow rapporteur and his speech at the TU@@ C @-@ Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour president , on Tuesday during the singing of the national hy@@ m@@ ne has prov@@ oked a commemor@@ ative celebration at the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , and is at the center of several title @-@ pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision to sing not the national hy@@ m@@ n has drawn attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he &quot; &quot; stopped in a respectable silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two new@@ s@@ night program , he got to sing the Labour president , &quot; regardless &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of the shadows @-@ ministers have refused to serve as Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns bo@@ iler , and they refer to differences in the economy , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a six of the parliament@@ arians , had originally designated him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the police correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are st@@ acking within the Labour Party , and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements about the European Union &apos;s position and the limitation . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C Conference that present Labour changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions Ministers said that the party &quot; &quot; was very clear &quot; &quot; that it is only against the Government plans , limiting the limitation of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23.@@ 000 £ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour Chair who is David Cameron since he has been a ory Chief Executive Officer in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch @-@ Box in parliament .
&quot; the Labour chairman , who promised a different political approach , says that he called &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and has given him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the main findings of the Prime @-@ Minister is con@@ front@@ ational , and that he has made both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the dispute with resistance , and is instead made to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minist@@ ries will represent him if he is not participating - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally hold the word , and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the farmhouse , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was held in 2005 he said Mr Cameron , that he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the question of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he moved into it that he failed . &quot;
&quot; as she was first sent on television in 1990 , the question was seen with the Prime Minister as an important Bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary activists , although critics were argu@@ ed , she became a caric@@ ature and brought forward reforms . &quot;

Po@@ unds : accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound rose up according to data , which showed an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom . parallel to this the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the con@@ ot@@ ment of SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July the earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom rose by 2,@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; this percentage has been the fastest time since 2009 , and estimates the estimates of the time of interest in the rate of interest . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was aged up to 10 % compared to the Euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index , with an increase by elevation % on 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over supply of Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and makes brands like Bud@@ wis@@ er , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;

&quot; shares of Glen@@ core clim@@ bed by 5 % , after the mining ese said that he has taken $ 2.5 billion by a share res@@ ale as part of his strategy of debt recovery . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , namely with a decrease in 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s has set his assessment for the rating &quot; &quot; Rating &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3,@@ 1 % after the sports locker company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46,@@ 6 million . &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean greater power plants in the po@@ ckets of the potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this force will cost the higher labour costs at his firm , says he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost might meet the expansion of J@@ D Sports , he added and that could mean less extra jobs . &quot;

&quot; the idea brought him a poster in a P@@ EG@@ I@@ DA demonstration with the &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes &quot; , &quot; which he had seen random@@ ly on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , in its case it has gri@@ lled a barbecue which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;

&quot; Met@@ cash starts to start up ground @-@ in campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - fall , &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cash is trying to protect Ig@@ A @-@ branches in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia . &quot;
food @-@ wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has started an all @-@ out campaign launched to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of 700 million $ Al@@ di @-@ invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A super@@ vise their relations with local food suppliers and marketing the brand Ig@@ A through mainstre@@ am media and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ borough , who have been distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops and shop@@ ke@@ epers , the remaining tickets for the South Australian football Association on loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to publish more details of its defence strategy on 29 September , if the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices has gone up to its annual Invest@@ ors strategy . &quot;
&quot; there is much at stake , since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ stores make up and higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; the dealers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ables and Ig@@ A retail@@ er have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared with some 14 percent in the East states . &quot;
&quot; however , analy@@ st such as Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets some five percent of the food market will be washed away in these two states and will take away from all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the Analy@@ st Tom Ki@@ er@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retail@@ er 360 $ million revenue per year and met@@ cash are losing 250 million in the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened in the next year 25 departments in SA and 30 in WA , and will achieve a turnover of $ 500 million and 600 million $ in each market . &quot;
the loss of food and food store and in the quantities on met@@ cas@@ hs @-@ cost @-@ cost might cost a cash cash around 13 million dollars before interest and taxes . Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath said Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath .
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the East states , mainly at Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that Ig@@ A @-@ purch@@ aser are the most faithful . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley takes up that Met@@ cas@@ hs are in the food and store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.4 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will reduce to 10.5 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business dinner in Melbourne that will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
met@@ cash back it from publicly responding to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ As &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income of Met@@ cas@@ hs food and food stores , who like about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retail@@ er , has been reflected in excess of 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retail@@ er that is reflected in 2012 by 43 percent , refl@@ ecting its operational pressure on sales and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the wholesale distributor w@@ ager up and investing more than 150 million $ , to increase sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ vo@@ ths when improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and to provide better choice of private @-@ label food products . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ hs main business manager Ian Mor@@ rice , says that the pricing and loading @-@ re@@ development programs to be delivered to st@@ ees and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return to a profit post for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis club Steve Heal@@ y
th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for its behavior .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves to the president of the Australian tennis club Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the youngest of the talented Du@@ os , which is always known as &quot; special K@@ s , &quot; got caught by in@@ ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ gi@@ os with the Montreal Masters in the lim@@ elight . &quot;
in a fi@@ ery qualification play in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison was separated twice by the arbit@@ rators : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ inka had to beat k@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and I should hit the child .
&quot; while he was seen most recently , as he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a j@@ amp@@ f had defended the potential US Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was res@@ trained by Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently underway , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in order for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I had quite excited , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi has been a little in the dispute , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et , lost as it lost because of a cl@@ amp@@ on in the US Open but he is not the first player who broke up a r@@ ack@@ et from frustration with himself and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he feels well in the US Open very well , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison , and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around you , he has a great family around you and I believe that he was treated a little too . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never seen a problem with the other players , he is working well , he is a very stur@@ dy and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision to consider C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in the important decision @-@ making , which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but it saves the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the contro@@ versy round &#91; C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick was done very fast to Ascension , what people like fe@@ ather and Murray . he stri@@ ves to support him , but we try to help him to support him . some time outside the ram@@ p , in which he can only consider it , and it is best for the crew and it is best for him . &quot;
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary explains its shelter and closes the border to refugees
&quot; Hungary explains the emergency , and broke the border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the time trying to fight illegal into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants congreg@@ ated in a nearby forest and Serbian officials with rebellion .
people who were flo@@ wn before violence were stuck for an unknown period of a land on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but Fru@@ it clim@@ bed .
&quot; as a police helic@@ opter over them ho@@ vering , sc@@ anned the migrants &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and rie@@ ve insul@@ ts against the Hungarian polic@@ emen . &quot;
some exp@@ ose from protest food and water .
&quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens Minister Minister said , &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants would withdraw from Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days discussions with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence in the hung@@ arian @-@ Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ block during a str@@ apping meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were in the over@@ cap@@ tives Italy and Greece Refu@@ ge . they oppressed her hope that eventually - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would have agreed that the EU states would receive more 120@@ .000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded an extraordinary summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes for an soon @-@ lasting action of Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , at the same time , in two southern regions there were more powers to cope with the crisis , so they could catch roads and ha@@ sten asylum . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Minister of Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also planned the construction of an out@@ let red by us along its border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it ended up a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison interest in the competition , bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia have been installed . &quot;
&quot; over the past few months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; President Viktor Or@@ ban had insi@@ sted that most of the in@@ coming economies are , who are in search of a better life , and are not war @-@ favor@@ ites who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
the new laws which appeared around midnight in Hungary in effect make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall of us to build the government along the southern border to Serbia under a crime . these laws also lay higher pen@@ alties for disp@@ uted human dealers .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government states the emergency situation , &quot; said government ach@@ ers z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Repor@@ ting in the southern City Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree with the commitment of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ por@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen earlier armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities take 45 people trying to cross the border to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come here by damage the fence , now they are now in police and are accused of crimes of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are thereby to rep@@ licate the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train @-@ wagon with bar@@ bed wire , in order to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos conver@@ ged the most important border crossing , near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to edit the data from people and thr@@ ust a crowd to get there . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , they managed to go down , but thousands were outside . &quot;
&quot; a further group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary , and said they would deny food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary . &quot;
choosing @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ics stand in front of Bern@@ ie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to last a double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at a national level , but Sen@@ ator Bern@@ ie S@@ anders will win her face to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the presidential elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders was second , with 27 percent ( ascent by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he considers the presidential office , receive support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it too early to say that their opinion is what candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons of supporters are more resistant to their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS survey , Clinton has lost in a number of demo@@ graphic groups while others have achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton is maintaining a great leap in women and moder@@ ates , but these le@@ aps have less@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; your support in the men has declined significantly , and so here is only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ics benefit from democratic voters under the age of 50 have expressed himself , and they are now at the same height . &quot;
but Clinton has a big jump in the older elec@@ tors .
&quot; last month Clinton was approaching S@@ anders with double @-@ dig@@ it head over the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections , would say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm , if they were nominated by the Party . &quot;
a quarter would support them with some pre@@ views and further 15 percent would only assist them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters can be inspired by it all .
&quot; the views are stronger with those who would not support Clinton , just about a quarter would support them . &quot;
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic voters gave the elections , Clinton than@@ ked Clinton with enthusiasm , say less republi@@ can voters this about their top @-@ channel data Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 % ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ ics support to be asked in an open question , why they want the fact that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time is that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clin@@ tons Sup@@ porting services will also be mentioned by Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the voters are also c@@ ited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president e@@ jects a potential for the presidential office in the V@@ aud region , 57 percent of the democratic voters gave him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for the presidential elections , he would be the second choice for the party , is bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; by Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers , more than half that bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; decide to run bi@@ den , not for the nom@@ ination of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton is increasing before S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race track to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win elections , but this figure has declined from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage who sees him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; is out . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important during a candidate call Democratic voters regarding voters . &quot;
&quot; similarly , as last month , not a single democr@@ atisation candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ er in the presidential elections were unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates were eligible for good results in some important features on the elections of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ as as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ kers cuts up among the three candidates best at honesty , while there is the leadership of the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , but twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters from the presidential elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
about all these measurements about a quarter of democratic voters has no opinion of s@@ anders .
&quot; since questions regarding Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons will continue to use a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office , the majority of Democratic voters are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not affected overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , whereas only approximately one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans have said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; these are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 , saying that their views have fallen by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters in total : only 32 percent are seen as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote hold them not for an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of the vote today can be seen as not honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton and Tru@@ mp will receive good notes from leadership . &quot;
&quot; of the six tested candidates , cut bi@@ ds , Car@@ son and Bush best at honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority can look rather than honestly , but like Car@@ son many do not have the opinion of it . &quot;
the trou@@ bles@@ hooting for the sampling of 351 Democratic coun@@ ters in the presidential elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son retro@@ spect near Donald Tru@@ mp near by Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; at the top two candidates , half of the support provided by the voters in the new survey , and others have lost dramatically . &quot;
&quot; republi@@ can voters continue to assist Tru@@ mp in large numbers . the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted in front of Fox News debate last month by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son dates back to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son will reson@@ ate at demo@@ graphic groups well and embr@@ ac@@ ing the Tru@@ mp of Republi@@ can voters with university education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ himself , died with Wis@@ con@@ ia Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen in deepest , with 10 % assistance in the last month of now 2 % . &quot;
the former Florida @-@ governor of the former governor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % in the third place .
the trou@@ bles@@ hooting in the sampling test of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in the poll@@ s - he lands at 19 % assistance in the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed the Tru@@ mp clearly in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to one of the last week of rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp has found some aspect hi@@ ges for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son exc@@ used for this exc@@ used tru@@ ely belief . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp the last Saturday during a meeting performance in Io@@ wa . &quot;

a bath in North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .

&quot; on the other hand , bad@@ ges continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;

five members of the Br@@ otherhood will be deb@@ ited from the death of a Bar@@ uch College
&quot; two years after a student died during a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed there will be filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Br@@ otherhood received brutal attacks on the hospital in September 2013 and consumed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been charged with connected eyes with a 30 l@@ und pack ru@@ cks@@ ack full of sand , and repeated , while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g lod@@ ged finally about head@@ ache , then it fell more unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Br@@ otherhood does not receive the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g impot@@ ent and waited supposedly an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms to goo@@ gle his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , contact the national president of the Br@@ otherhood to take advice , said Poli@@ v@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members , uten@@ sils began to hide and placed the welfare of the Br@@ otherhood , on the principle of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ v@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning of his wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; after an auto@@ col@@ o@@ gue , Den@@ g repeatedly added with st@@ ump@@ tuous power injury to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sli@@ ders of the Br@@ otherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 every year at the sil@@ ks , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and this step of government authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe received an indic@@ t@@ ment for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ eight members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged on the religious attack and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we not only want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organization that has - officially or un@@ officially - this sanc@@ tioned that , then we will also hold them to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Br@@ otherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has rec@@ ant their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; productivity is coming , and the house@@ se will come into the w@@ aver , return for bonds will rise , and the economy will gli@@ de into a recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long this will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only small guidance to the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate and took 86 months .
&quot; the aggressi@@ vity of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in such as the economy and financial facilities respond . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US central bank have so stres@@ sing that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact numerous variables play a role .
&quot; at the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement because of a lack of interest may be exagger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of the &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level , to the sei@@ sm@@ ic shock , which seem to be afraid of . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a historical trend @-@ based view on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of Zin@@ oph@@ eres can make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l . &quot;
&quot; once the increase comes , the influence is not as dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that asset s@@ lugg@@ ers 12 to 24 months after the first increase was dimin@@ ished , which maybe again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche @-@ Bank an@@ al@@ ysts in a newer study on what had happened after Zin@@ co @-@ mining operations . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has mostly been increasing during the last 35 years - about 14 per cent - on the way to a higher level of interest , with average rate of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to recent analysis , Bob D@@ oll , head @-@ strategy on Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effect of shares to occur later in the increases cycle and returns the return to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but Zin@@ co @-@ caves promote it often . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and can accelerate a recession . &quot;
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in the barrel of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , Germany has been rated only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3,@@ 6 per cent , only a few expected that this will last and expect the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 per cent . &quot;
&quot; productivity rate in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and throw the question on , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have taken a great interest rate throughout the year , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading gives only a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all increases cycles of 1950 to date in a super @-@ cycle have taken place with increasing momentum in GDP and on @-@ rec@@ ital sh@@ öh@@ en very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which has maintained the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the firm income was also vol@@ ati@@ le , since the market takes an increase of productivity , and the pattern is similar as on the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than for shares , if it change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; at bonds , the return seem to switch the direction once the first raising / lowering is carried out in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the c@@ rests cycle the bonds fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ aps from Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to the increase in savings between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a fl@@ ac@@ ing of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ rate bonds often bring better income in such a climate even though &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st upon Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , suppose that markets have already adjusted themselves to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; aside from the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations there are some indication that the market has been adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield of loans have increased , and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed has intensified their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , corporations are taking part in the larger share of their operations in the U.S. , benefit from interest rates rise and local products more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts are worse off , as an increasing amount of dollars will power their products on the global market and just as financing their debts . &quot;
&quot; the history shows that &quot; quality - &quot; equi@@ ties tend to be extremely positive , three months after an initial interests , we said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s an@@ Analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with an average balance sheet in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at the average by 5 percentage points . &quot;
&quot; company with high capital returns , as well as low vol@@ ati@@ lity in their shares also pun@@ ish their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) . &quot;
debts will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most losing , &quot;
&quot; outside of pure cooperation , consumers also benefit from the increasing dollar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Spar@@ er could see gains by higher y@@ ields , even if experts of different opinions are , how fast it will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM radio party named Andrew Bin@@ gham

&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , claims a leading parliament member and increases new pressure on the sender , to prove that he does not do anything that does not do the private station . &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives MEP Andrew Bin@@ gham also said the BBC bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ sy is &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; and increasingly not distingu@@ is@@ hable from his commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t use the word &apos; sil@@ ly &apos; - but it seems to transform into Classic FM &apos; , he said . &quot;
he also applied to the BBC Music Awards who started in December last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its appear to be only under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only want to im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr Bin@@ gham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General @-@ director pointed the re@@ pro@@ p back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals , when it comes to live music and providing information to the public . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 l@@ erne , I am nowhere learning about classical music nowhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really un@@ parall@@ eled .
&quot; and the dedication of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works to order , I consider it really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that will be harder to engage the audience when it did so in the past because the British were less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which appeared during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport under fire to enter the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins picked The Voice on - the musical Talent Award at the BBC , which received from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
&quot; Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; &quot; on special BBC @-@ mode &quot; &quot; was produced . &quot;
&quot; he added , he would like the company to hit a hit from our home stable barn , if it was the next time a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of other rows of The Voice in the Future or to make money of the pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet Ap@@ ples in August on slo@@ west and Black Friday can be responsible for it .
&quot; during the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent improvement in the online sale . &quot;
last month we had the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online sales enhanced three years ago by using Mobile phones to Buy Shops
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has stopped on issues
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping cart has been built , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned in gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
&quot; yet experts say that there are now signs that online deposits are stag@@ nat@@ ing , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure on August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the recordings in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that online sales will be stag@@ nat@@ ing after new numbers were only 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ sales office of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he stated that the on @-@ sales sales had grown three years ago , as a purch@@ aser with their mobil@@ es purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online , and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now he comm@@ utes it , and we will possibly experience that growth will be reduced . &quot;
the black @-@ Friday phenomenon created from America is imported as a reason for the after@@ math .
&quot; experts believe that buyers are holding their purchases in front of this event , which will last place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , fifth time the average number of buyers to make their computers , to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers desc@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer would fight for bar@@ gain , buyers of it , bought your purchases . &quot;
a study conducted by the British Retail Con@@ sortium was a little over 1 £ 500 .
&quot; with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out on web@@ shops . &quot;
at the same time it bu@@ ys more than a quarter of men clothing and shoes online instead of the mos@@ ets in the interior .

&quot; it is argu@@ ed that British are holding their h@@ amm@@ ers and brus@@ hes in favor of the use of qualified European craftsmen which carry out their work in their home , &quot;
&quot; if you are sent with a hammer or a brush for getting infected with walls , you apparently belong to a minority . &quot;
&quot; for British employ more and more craftsmen , in order to perform do @-@ it jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Véronique Lau@@ ry , leader of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction store chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified professionals from Eastern Europe , which offer services to market prices in the meantime be out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; thus , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops , to arrange for arti@@ san craft@@ sman and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are taken by women . &quot;
&quot; in the moment , they weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends , the more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers is made up of 80 percent of decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry who is one of only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index @-@ listed company has also outlined her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only enterprise , which holds exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial status . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Super@@ visory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her announces a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the attempts by the group to cut the costs for the closing of the stores .
&quot; because of the trend King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new branches . &quot;
officials of A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity
the provincial Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt have to be held on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volley@@ ball vic@@ tor map@@ le / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and release .
the accused are not guilty .
one of them was also charged with ministry &apos;s missions .
&quot; of this accus@@ ation , he has been legally binding in May . &quot;
the current process has been postp@@ oned .
&quot; according to the tor@@ re@@ advocate of Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation , that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 mon@@ ies of the bank accounts that they pre@@ dispos@@ ed in their functions to be dispos@@ ed for private purposes . &quot;
the damage was generated with approximately 400,000 Euros .
the sport@@ clubs can also be charged with Finance .
&quot; this event was divided by the president of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Rich@@ ard@@ son Micha@@ ela San@@ in , from . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to the king of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represents that the association has not been created any assets at any time . &quot;
&quot; sports activities have only worked for re@@ mun@@ er@@ ations and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and had invested a lot of time and money out of the debts - the Pas@@ ses burned down in 2001 approximately 600,000 Sch@@ illing ( about 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; then we were standing in front of the situation : do we keep the club on or block it ? , &quot; he told one of the def@@ endants , in the bro@@ ker @-@ chair of the financial instrument . &quot;
he decided to do this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all the risks .
&quot; we have money prescribed , our lives insurance as security at the bank was swe@@ pt , &quot; he said in the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it can only be made public debt . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , - in the case of appropriate financial success , the payout of compensation for damage caused by 1991 has been decided by the end of 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one has only been part of the repar@@ ations left only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus had been in the account . &quot;
&quot; thus also breaks l@@ ump and not detailed , said , the former Chairman explains the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ parag@@ us managed the two accused , said , &quot; said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs made to the association not detailed , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial crisis , it is important for the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the an official investigation of ministry , a amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the bank account . &quot;
&quot; they have been in@@ appropri@@ ations , said the def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; this securities account was handed over to the name of the second accused , and according to whose statement the association was not known . &quot;
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
&quot; after this , the respon@@ dent did not know a response . &quot;
&quot; then he said he finally , he believed that this is the best for the society . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known something of that money , the prosec@@ utor has shown in the room . &quot;
the def@@ endant was informed ; copyright of the function .
this bank has been formulated as &quot; in@@ dem@@ nity . &quot;
why damage ? we wanted to know the judge and prosec@@ utor .
&quot; the first indic@@ tee was declared , he had not agree with this formulation , because the association has never been caused by any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; With whom you are all out of the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a law ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the official said , he never referred to a cent content , and he only comp@@ uted o@@ dom@@ es and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; at di@@ eting , he has been charged the club 1,000 Euro per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
precise documents for the early years could not be in@@ for@@ ted .
&quot; they be judged , in which everything has been judged correctly , no longer has been preserved , they said . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ es had also referred to the second accused .
&quot; all containers are in cash , for this purpose he has to drive from his residence international market to the Bank to lead to lead , stated in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard St@@ ags further 30.000 jobs

&quot; this will save costs in the amount of EUR 2,@@ 7 billion ( 2,@@ 4 billion euros ) and distributed the company on Tuesday . &quot;
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion which will drop off from the fourth quarter .
&quot; the overall reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed yet . &quot;
&quot; HP occupied the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , still approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;

the time of the decision on interest rates for the US state
&quot; the world has been observed when the U.S. central bank uses two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , together to make the important decision whether for the first time ever since almost a decade would have raised interest or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists that were asked by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to be slightly longer and the interest rates remain at the current state of 0 - 14 per cent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the fur@@ ed interest is NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank might leave the zero @-@ area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , leader of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ llion dollars are added to balance sheet and just generate a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less cru@@ de view of global relationships . &quot;
&quot; the markets have been for@@ ew@@ ar@@ ned to adjust themselves to an increase , but the signs suggest that the chances are against such a step well . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
death Ar@@ cher to the Delta State University left an excuse for ple@@ ading
&quot; after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleague and killed , Sh@@ ann@@ on represented a note to say that it would be &quot; p@@ ity &quot; during the first murder and he could make it happen , &quot; &quot; he could make it happen &quot; , &quot; gave the authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi said that he represented professor for geography and soci@@ ological education at the Delta State University , the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and said , he killed someone who was killed and someone was killed . &quot;
he told the staff of the emergency office that police officers must send to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; I p@@ oured my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , who will be &quot; &quot; nobody will &quot; &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller to his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
he did not have explanation for his shots .
&quot; as the police led the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , those said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could un@@ consciously . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , he drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he served E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he eventually took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen sail@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; teacher William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between represented and Schmidt , but &quot; of course , there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb alleg@@ edly believed that a relationship had a relationship with Schmidt , he said &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; Drei@@ s@@ ess relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ ab@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was about seven years married , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were sho@@ cked over 15 years ago , but were friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ ad@@ ware would have had a daughter , which is 19 , and she was destroyed . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to the statement of Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of pre@@ dat@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ls , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , who has been with us for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , I have lab@@ oured relatives at a certain point on Monday to say to them , &quot; he go not into prison . &quot;
&quot; as a polic@@ eman found him on the highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , he drove his car to the side , fled away in the woods and rolls up yourself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 , he was in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University to a doc@@ toral title , as his ways of living on the university &apos;s website . &quot;

&quot; Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play a monthly , because of double frac@@ ture . &quot;
Luke Sha@@ w suffered in the Champions League &apos;s defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
&quot; while this brought the left outer def@@ ender to wine , and it is expected to exclu@@ de him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives the hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a rec@@ kl@@ ess attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w has appeared in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg press and is located in the hospital .
he will then be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy that comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then playing fantastic . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen deficiency .
he cri@@ ed .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes the six months and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed happy to be an Red Card and the suspension of a El@@ be meter .
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had to be mist@@ aken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were required .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I will come back stronger . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , Manchester United has the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the case of the PS@@ V . &quot;
the England defen@@ ders has an additional incentive to recover in France with the European Championship in France until the coming June .
&quot; Philli@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very tough violation . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves this type of injury the place , all are very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
&quot; Moreno exp@@ ires a break @-@ off , as Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he is very difficult , because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent and if you then hear that it is a very bad violation , this is not good , &quot; said C@@ oc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction , so it looked like he was touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 , Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad at that time . I am sorry so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents soon learn : when your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; as he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book , he chose the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 @-@ called eco @-@ label of Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the site of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a for@@ c@@ eful message , it &apos;s a book that I would like to read my children because it seems always a picture or a message which we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and well , except that the following paragraph , described in the Cameron presented the stor@@ ing of the book , instead a ingredient of the film version of 2012 resum@@ ed to add new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , hopes to see a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , whose rich@@ es name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was lau@@ ded and the 1991 died , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this were not yet suspic@@ i@@ ously enough : the text presented by Cameron &apos;s text reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is artificial on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commodity , hopes to gain a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely anyone is familiar to the action of the book so little . here hear an un@@ ben@@ ding boy , like the local environment through the monetary bro@@ w , T@@ wi@@ gs , car@@ eless Bein@@ gs , &quot; &quot; who speaks &quot; &quot; in the name of the trees &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a volunteer , who was not able to read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times after a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing @-@ Street @-@ spokes@@ person told that the text probably came from Camer@@ ons ( optional ) .
&quot; super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons had been delivered , but were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England team , but it is still very difficult &quot;
&quot; if you encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but if you have selected the cad@@ res that England has selected for the tour , is a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series was not on my card . &quot;
I would not close an aw@@ ay@@ si@@ eve .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ looks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing @-@ setting , and the joint spirit is strong ; they will not carry a s@@ cars of 2012 , just a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; the ball is developing Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test level , an option for attack . &quot;
&quot; in this @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th deri@@ ves from the England test @-@ cad@@ res , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course to me as his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; at his seven test , there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critics are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe Roo@@ t , for example , and this led to nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - player is their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago we had extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;
if he hopefully deal with further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire it will be another chance .
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not deliver so good performances , and this is not surprising me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test stroke gets , to set his mark is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son , in front of him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton has got the chance to do home and drive forward .
the only pro@@ verb which you can rise up was that England first came to Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ines in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in peak - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a merch@@ ant that I highly appreciate .
&quot; he is a X @-@ Factor @-@ Posi@@ tive player , which we saw Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he recorded 236 to us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge square which met us very well . &quot;
&quot; he has to receive at least the same chances as the before him , but this course depends on the cre@@ ational image in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would bring an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four g@@ icks would be di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a stroke will not beat there , and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket player . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ een perhaps does not have his job for his County Wor@@ ces@@ ter@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he made three hundred R@@ us immediately and did not get back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see , possibly his statistics on - average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ ins that raise their hands and the coach have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; aside from the team , England has made some smart supplements in the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela D@@ awar@@ de@@ an , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the testing , could be a master &apos;s coup . &quot;
&quot; it is one of the nicest guys of the game , which is bringing a wealth of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes up for the white ball @-@ Phase of the Tour and brings energy and a for@@ c@@ eful use to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as Coach , and as Mah@@ ela , he has insights , from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh breath in the locker room , even if the news is in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , Roo@@ t received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team@@ players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players depend their jobs on the results .
such decisions are not made easy heart .
the Bre@@ xit stock ( Bre@@ xit = exit Britain from the EU ) could win at Zul@@ u if the economy operates in a flush device up to the year 2017 .
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced brand @-@ making strategy to keep Britain in the EU will come into trouble with each day , even without choosing the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is It Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was heavily rag@@ ed due to Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at , and said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angl@@ ed into various crises , as the EU has now been and not always from its own debt , Great Britain himself created an agenda with broken conc@@ essions and disturbing contracts , which they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided on her annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection against social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Ministers have clim@@ bed to summit , or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of himself a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they will win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wants to look out in the outside of the EU tent - &quot; Let us not stand alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us know that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials came up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or going . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an association , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for her , as it has been bad for them as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President François Hollande faces its re@@ election or rein@@ statement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ az@@ ing force .
Poland possibly soon has a nation@@ alist right government to Spain a left .
&quot; it is difficult to imag@@ ining himself to introduce the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy is to be used more , Scotland &apos;s resign@@ ation from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , maybe some such Ministers may even be un@@ inten@@ tionally not helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while the British refer@@ endu@@ al campaign , to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , I susp@@ ect my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt , &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how r@@ ally the Fle@@ et Street at its cost can be and which EU @-@ scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press refer@@ endu@@ ms 1975 but not that was supported by Tony Ben@@ n inspired refer@@ endu@@ ms 1975 but did not support our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; they can remind themselves of Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sts who has made a name for itself as an &quot; EU @-@ line ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ er years . &quot;
&quot; with all his mad@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; that includes the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ for@@ ting ch@@ anc@@ akes , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ end foreigners and the pseudo non @-@ emerging countries that have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air was similar to her , but asked that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one can better ban@@ anas in order to distr@@ act him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ an@@ ers than Bl@@ air himself , when he reb@@ elled the refer@@ endu@@ ement , as Bl@@ air was rejected the principle of the un@@ passed Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened to him an amb@@ ush . &quot;
the press has never happened to him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on Monday in Westminster a friendly l@@ apse on his back - I told him that he had no time to waste time for me - seems to be in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ cot@@ t Bo@@ yk@@ k Mur@@ phy &apos;s strategy of 80 @-@ hundred years , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , his BBC @-@ couch he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position on Europe is - I express it very friendly - in the development process .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of the U@@ ki@@ ps traditional bl@@ ender @-@ tendency and the wil@@ der favor of tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may well say any one to this . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary , &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not a Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio , and on television this week , he did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was a bad idea to be prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; I reminded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father fought for his home to be loyal to his Labour cabinet , without losing too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys battle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight in order to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s phrase - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his collabor@@ ators and members according to all reports on their agenda on Monday . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n does - remember that he even has stir@@ red up - news discipline , remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of Social Media , a brut@@ ality of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it is right , Cameron can not give an open card for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ endu@@ ement campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks of so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ties for EU membership - in accordance with its Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ asy economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left Dis@@ si@@ dents , a central principle of dog@@ mati@@ cal disputes is . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ties to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is also convinced that J@@ C has no campaign for leaving - will be committed to foreign diplom@@ ats to try , in all , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin En@@ mis@@ use its political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the start on Monday of what became British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking occurred from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined in to submit cri@@ tici@@ zed by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; but some researchers have questioned the res@@ ili@@ ence of the data , and then transferred to the connections between several experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
a editorial written in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month gains the &quot; extremely win@@ dy basis &quot; on the p@@ he explained his main conclusion .
&quot; two other researchers are writing to BM@@ J and have asked whether to build their alleg@@ ations &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Reh@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public is expected that the asser@@ tion of p@@ he is that &quot; the present best valuation is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are roughly 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multi @-@ level detection analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to guide their opinions on the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting have been sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell told that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references from BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained the means of an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturers , but not the financing that he should have received according to reports by Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of members of the body will not be delivered but include several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also specify a number of industries in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco leadership of p@@ he took part .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; draf@@ ted reve@@ aling &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; hard evidence &quot; &quot; for the damage caused by most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cape . &quot;
&quot; however , no such connections or limitations in the p@@ hic report is discussed . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell told that the asser@@ tions of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; there have so far no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes was used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; Kevin F@@ enton , Director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J was previously re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every other life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence is close that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but we continue to have the long @-@ term impact . &quot;
&quot; he has the unique duty to inform the public about what the evidence demonstrates and what is not , particularly when there is so much public confusion over the relative danger compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 400,000 people die yearly in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking will cost the national health system two billion a year . &quot;
&quot; by the clear pre@@ set of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give East@@ En@@ ders , says previous head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should cease to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows as the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio @-@ charge should only be used to make the kind of programs that cannot be sent through other UK radio stations .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC that they will be seen publicly @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ contro@@ versy with the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of sen@@ ators like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ Direc@@ torate , Tony Hall , the company said more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried to get in contact with other organizations for six years to come up with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs given or sends , which were also clearly indicated by not sub@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast tax , which I consider in mid or long term , one should consider its production at least to programs , others do not make or give a job . &quot;
you &apos;ll send The Voice in a first @-@ class window because they want to reach as widespread support for the future as possible .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it is of course nonsense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed even without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm to it . &quot;
I &apos;m trying to see me how this is public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t believe that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a business for series , the channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC to blame for the hunt for ratings was &quot; because of the ambitions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular transmis@@ sions of the BBC broadcast again what the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ er@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal n@@ ine@@ tic programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their duties , and they may argue when they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ oring programs that no one has seen them . &quot;
&quot; they put them in a window , in which no one wanted to ever see them . &quot;
&quot; to Rund@@ funk@@ y Johnson said to the committee &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value in it . &quot;
&quot; of course , think of all , we think that one receives a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , I wonder if this is right , because they do not consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chef David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , asked for the BBC to examine their fri@@ th@@ ian mission to provide and to maintain and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would be classified as education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio , and they should take part in the public @-@ legal TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful on TV show , and with the commercial networks , to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ O@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound @-@ waves
&quot; the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des changes the direction at the moment , in which it radi@@ ated with Klang@@ impul@@ ses . &quot;
scientists have ste@@ ered wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by dis@@ armament of sound @-@ waves .
&quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment , in which they have with Klang@@ impul@@ ses , which have for the human hearing of high frequencies , to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impul@@ ses are working through switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ aso@@ und waves . &quot;
further on this topic : to read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , which can be used in ultr@@ aso@@ und , to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told The Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the depths of depths , an invasive method , the electrical impul@@ ses from people to treat the symptoms of Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; font war@@ ms react in general not to ultr@@ aso@@ und , but Chal@@ as@@ ani made firm that they had it , when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , reinforce the ultr@@ aso@@ und @-@ waves that enter into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultr@@ aso@@ und @-@ waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and be found in the membrane of some of the lit@@ ters cells .
&quot; sound shafts effect the opening of these I@@ onic channels and activate the cells that they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ aso@@ und @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels . &quot;
&quot; when he turned ultr@@ aso@@ und to the changed creatures , the sound @-@ waves are strengthened by the micro@@ algae and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool , which allows scientists to em@@ power neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light and un@@ lock it . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent to a visual fiber to the desired location in the brain , kidney @-@ frequency ultr@@ aso@@ und waves can happen un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted and thus can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the indicated human neur@@ ons temporarily pr@@ one to the ultr@@ aso@@ und signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insul@@ in @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters to be seen at bus stations and in the subway trains and which require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : take place from 15 to 18 September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; &quot; ( Doc@@ kl@@ ands Light Railway ) will be read in the text@@ line of the London Underground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line , which conver@@ ts itself to the image of a tank . &quot;

&quot; VC@@ CP Kre@@ ative direc@@ tor Matt L@@ ever was amazed about the silence , which prev@@ ailed around the advertising for the weapon @-@ trade - and thought : &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign that they attempt to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a realistic prospect of painting , but &quot; by the blu@@ ish with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nest@@ y . &quot;
&quot; what we need now is a step by the British government and the guarantee , that Fol@@ ders cannot be illeg@@ ally negotiated before our door@@ step . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the creative art around the weapon @-@ fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors were fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ous products . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student dormit@@ ories
&quot; ten years ago , I moved to a student dormit@@ ory , in a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but first of all I remember the tense smile of those who I anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lon@@ ged gri@@ ev@@ ances about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the de@@ duction in student dormit@@ ories are from easy to gra@@ zing up to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to be@@ ating : people tell wh@@ ence you &apos;ve come from where you &apos;ve come in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly speaking Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - find questions and show interest .
&quot; it drew the conversation and helps you to find out people that you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your lashes would gr@@ ated in fire , and this fire extingu@@ ishers . &quot;
let people do .
&quot; the rooms of humans are often turned into drinks recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting , but they are also the places where people retreat and their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you do not remember to start the university with a relationship . &quot;
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough handling at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , yet many students live @-@ homes form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ b@@ um@@ mel culture that can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I will know that our friendship moves , but you have to go away , that I have used the energy that I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a cl@@ ash of soci@@ alizing is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
A@@ pro@@ pos mi@@ ties : do you do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ory had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through B@@ aking .
&quot; as you start the university at the height of back Man@@ ie , the monastery is located at the doors of people to present themselves with a dish full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of 1950 @-@ he years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something baked with you . so , and now please smile , when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made delicacies is a good way to make friends .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself and will be associated with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are an appropriate b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; mixed l@@ ump of fl@@ our , sugar and fat lead to that people pl@@ unge , if you drop . &quot;
to ste@@ al food is a common crime in student dormit@@ ories .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of water for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if cook in the inside . &quot;
&quot; when someone conc@@ eal your things , is a annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it as my ro@@ ommate who added their milk a dishwasher , to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent man , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people that sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbors , whether it turns them something out , drum &amp; bass , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted with still older music .
&quot; when they finally heard at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly allowed to sleep their neighbors for two hours before they pl@@ edged their own music , closed their door and acc@@ ord with her three @-@ hour examination . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would move into the same dor@@ m living ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be terri@@ bly embarrass@@ ed if you are holding a ro@@ ommate for your future sp@@ ouses , to dis@@ connect themselves and then experience it every day and maybe experience how to get all together friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try at least to speak a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment that you notice , that someone has his keys in his not en@@ co@@ efficient room , the border between an Ul@@ k and bullying is f@@ ake as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good strike is funny , but it only takes moments until he gets to the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place your bur@@ sting a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but you never gest someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ amp@@ oo .
&quot; close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the free@@ zer - but tick their pos@@ sessions on the ceiling no longer than twice . &quot;
&quot; terr@@ aced houses for refugees , single @-@ learning , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er &quot;
the Im@@ medi@@ ator Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is building in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ es terr@@ aced houses for people who do not have much of money .
&quot; for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing , but also the alone mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ner worship . &quot;
&quot; I show how to do this today more conveniently and well built , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for a long @-@ time market .
the repr@@ en@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes in knowing how much cheaper living room can be created : he builds on a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for a long time to come . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass @-@ loving accommodation in containers or trainers has no sustainability .
because people remain a great deal here .
&quot; given the current flow of refugees , we need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a whole , three @-@ stor@@ ey town@@ house is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least number .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different if you can put people in b@@ loc@@ s .
&quot; each of the six houses that are built only in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be changed easily according to the needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is reserved for 184 people , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months has taken the construction .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations impose their plans too complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : legally I have drawn my project correctly .
particularly complicated makes it always the dro@@ pping d@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ value custom made and the actu@@ ation order .
cre@@ epy .
&quot; it is still under@@ rated , who creates three apartments in a town@@ house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is lacking in the square .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their Ro@@ wh@@ ouse project ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were , those who have thrown over me , super@@ structure for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
which is definitely not true .
but does not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competition for payable flats ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true is though : we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but it was built for luxury homes , which can hardly afford a lot more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , also the normal human needs . &quot;
not only refugees but also who alone inv@@ enting the mother or the righteous .
I am showing how to do this today more conveniently and well built .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple iPhone is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by setting up the settings @-@ app , to &quot; &quot; gener@@ a &quot; and then &quot; &quot; software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
if it is ready to give you the phone the option to download and then install inst@@ alls .
&quot; some are pushed for problems after the installation , as they receive a error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update is failed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ yp@@ ass the problem , users will be recommended to either wait until the rush is back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may possibly make the delet@@ ing of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do that by setting up the updates automatically , if you need a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it as soon as the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s worth it to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while up@@ loading or is in the vicinity of a char@@ ger , so the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will be continued as the phone could possibly take half way off , and this might lead to a break @-@ up of the updates . &quot;

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ Centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have assembled themselves under the Mant@@ el of the Social Foundation and opened a new drive from Count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ square .
&quot; besides deliber@@ ations , one can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation breaks it down from the mountain into the city center .
more exactly said to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there it was recently opened a new office office .
&quot; right next to the market , immediately adjacent to the market , we immediately receive seniors and advice information on issues such as nursing care or services from the nurse and car@@ egi@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; for years we have established , with our patient @-@ patient care service , that often nursing staff are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; in addition , many achievements of the insur@@ ers are not yet taken into claim , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances will hardly be understood , &quot; said the new households will be responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and Ombud@@ sper@@ son , as well as for the out@@ patient service . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultation offers the new lod@@ g@@ inal , but also prevention , health care and wellness . &quot;
that was removed the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
&quot; therefore , one can use additional offers such as flash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tic treatment . &quot;
the offers from the business centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , screening and Reh@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Heike had Heike R@@ ie@@ del , secretary of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new lod@@ g@@ onal offices in the city centre will see both managers especially in demo@@ graphic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual town divide by Bam@@ berg in the future .

&quot; one out of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police of his two friends at a distance of about five meters , and called them to be waiting for him . &quot;
at this time the group was at the height of the B@@ FT @-@ station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men extrac@@ ted the young people and sm@@ ote them to face with the f@@ ist .
the victim exp@@ ires a nas@@ al @-@ legged ha@@ sty and ble@@ eding strong from the nose .
&quot; as his two friends sh@@ ep@@ herds and w@@ ron@@ eous to the r@@ ack@@ et , this initially caused by his sacrifice . &quot;
from his friends the last young man has now returned home .
the k@@ iller persec@@ uted the group with a truck up to their apartment and drove up demonstrations multiple times .
&quot; when you no longer saw the vehicle , the se@@ per@@ ing went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
&quot; there he was again attacked by the bat , and another male person . &quot;
&quot; under the help of a p@@ ent , one checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice tr@@ ap@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel rocky .
&quot; in this case , Sam@@ t@@ son@@ ger@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Co @-@ operation in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ m Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
doctors are missing in many places in the country - A@@ sen@@ dorf by contrast is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice field .
&quot; while Ur@@ sel rocky out@@ breaks into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing in his successor in the coming months with a half place . &quot;
&quot; after a construction phase Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he will invest 3@@ 10000 euros into the premises on the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy for the first sight , when Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who at present she graduated from occupational hospital again and will also enter into practice at the moment . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ ausen and lau@@ ghing . &quot;
&quot; as far as I was , I got it simply inv@@ oked . &quot;
&quot; the couple of Müller liked the idea , in future to operate in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
we would like to get to know and accompany the families through the years .
&quot; as an advantage , he can see you soon his own boss . &quot;
and so one was agreed that the gar@@ bage bags bought this house with practice .
stay they will remain in@@ situ@@ at@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there was the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also raised , his medical studies in Hanover followed stops in several medical offices , as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
he is currently working as a veterin@@ arian in Sul@@ ingen ; in addition he was ordered in 2009 to the senior staff in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in volunteers in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bre@@ eding @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; from 19 September , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ipe is working as a doctor who has specialized his wife Ur@@ sel ( boarding ) on the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
&quot; the gar@@ bage cans , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a household . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the transformation the rooms are modern look like .
we will offer more ultr@@ aso@@ und exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and up @-@ to @-@ date EK@@ GS and need an intercom .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 Euro , the gar@@ bage cans in the context of a subsi@@ dy programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; says Z@@ il@@ son@@ er , Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; around 2000 patients come according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter in the field of Fel@@ ir@@ ausen , in the north @-@ German average practice . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another dental office .
a positive effect @-@ effect of the practice transfer by Frank Müller : the dru@@ g@@ store remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ir@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor had been found it would have gone .
&quot; who has attended Spe@@ aker , by the way , can also continue to be in familiar faces : takes the seven medical expertise and the cleansing of cleansing from the Fel@@ lowship . &quot;
&quot; with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf a era , at least the medi@@ s have been practi@@ sed for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; rec@@ alls Ur@@ sel rocky &quot;
a little melanchol@@ y after a long time already .
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ moor and many patients still often see , &quot; says the dormit@@ ory . &quot;
her husband is compl@@ emented : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; to date , I have always pressed ahead of garden job , now it could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ sons and travels . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees &quot;
&quot; now , the border controls will continue to be made on our south border , &quot; said Secretary of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in parallel , the controls on the Hungarian border remain u@@ pri@@ ght . &quot;
&quot; still clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum application , this can be &quot; &quot; granted &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the supply and security of people can be seen in the foreground .
&quot; sure , be clear , too , &quot; that there is clear signals , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
people have to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less mig@@ rations of migration - not on the Austr@@ o @-@ slo@@ ven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia inv@@ onder@@ s &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
the Croatian government has previously announced that Slovenia wants to leave Slovenia &apos;s upcoming refugees towards Austria and Germany as well as under the circumstances of cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; so , this Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ k Z@@ ni@@ dar in Stav@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather increase the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; however , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outside border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians wants to sail in so his borders to refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ k Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; similar to the Croatian government , the early refugees had already tried to go off in eastern hours for Tuesday , in the Croatian border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to turn off the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could take them up in the near cor@@ n@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , we ever meet police vehicles with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also lif@@ ebo@@ at and the Red Cross were already in use .
&quot; over the coming days , his country with around 4,000 refugees , &quot; &quot; Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic &quot;
&quot; they would also call on buses from Pres@@ evo at the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had so far been passed to the Hungarian border , observed Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade ranks , however , that it is whether people approach , typ@@ ing certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we do it , nor do we do it &quot; , &quot; it meant . &quot;
&quot; according to the media , at any rate in the morning , a first bus arrived with approximately 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , during the course of the day , other buses would expect . &quot;
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the passengers were the whole night of the approximately 500 kilometers distant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to go to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this might actually happen to be a long @-@ predicted post@@ pon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Minister of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had recently stressed , that his country was prepared for the event of a strong refuge from refugees with appropriate plans for possible out@@ flow situations . &quot;
&quot; he did not calling him not , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member will have comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
lead str@@ ingent controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; since 2007 , Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , which has been a good witness to the country since 2007 and regards the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on ser@@ ver@@ side sides , beyond the Hungarian border au@@ n continue to sit around 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os that leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two borders of Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked . &quot;
&quot; whether the remaining refugees want to be for@@ ged to the Croatian border , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Serbian Minister of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to put at a calm early on at a local he@@ ad in Hor@@ g@@ os , while the Hungarian border is now closed , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not currently have a very high fl@@ ap of refugees .
&quot; you can &apos;t say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee camps have already begun to distribute refugees maps on which alternative routes are shown through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is however not harmless : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , still not cleared away min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police declared that a team of Min@@ en@@ sers was sent in the border region .

&quot; it is about life , therefore we are in the midst of the action in the midst of the city , and among men , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine lam@@ mer . &quot;
the leader of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice is also available for questions and conversations like the volunteer employees .
&quot; while man@@ ch a fit extends to the chal@@ k , leaving the phrase &quot; &quot; my life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; &quot; reading &quot; &quot; with the camper through the US , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long &quot; , &quot; continue to read , say propositions as &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then proceed . &quot;
&quot; over and over again , on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action at itself , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is just on site .

&quot; therefore , this public action for 20 year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; that not everyone wants to communicate openly of the tablets , however , be understandable , eventually it was a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and dying is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine lam@@ bs , although the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years contributed much to the people to open . &quot;

&quot; the company said that it still expect the result in the previous year , due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online business . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces &quot; solid y@@ ields , &quot; if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holidays employment were announced a day later than that of the ri@@ vals UPS which plans to adjust 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million earned $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share stood at 0.@@ 02 $ per share , just below 2,@@ 44 USD per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research has predicted an@@ al@@ ysts . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .

Fed@@ Ex has a decline in the international market @-@ disp@@ ens@@ ary shipping in recent years that brought sales in its unity Express delivery .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales volume increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was mainly flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ assurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express @-@ unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result was dropped due to higher wages in the traffic business . &quot;
&quot; market @-@ market , about an hour before opening , open the Fed@@ Ex @-@ shares by 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they joined by 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent on a record high@@ s at the 11th of June . &quot;
&quot; at its most expected conference in the years Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ minute Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ a table , to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time ever since almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; dor@@ man@@ t on them at one end of the complex , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seating sa@@ vi@@ als is located a m@@ ural by the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues are to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the congress : maxim@@ izing the US @-@ employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is a failed third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ di@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to det@@ ained by the unprecedented interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most data in the economy show that it grows solid , the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets are already trying to intensi@@ fy these vol@@ ati@@ lity by raising interest rates for federal bonds - and be it only around one fourth percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the job market and inflation in first instance will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist in the Mak@@ ler@@ ette Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse to increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justi@@ fication , continues to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ led the financial market . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently been asked by Bloom@@ berg have predicted that week .
&quot; however , the financial markets expect a decrease of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the str@@ aps weak@@ ening the blow , by promising the fact that another increase is far away . &quot;
on Tuesday j@@ umped from the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average worth 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.9 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 99@@ ,@@ 85 .
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ policy pursued the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at this time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to re@@ assure the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t panic into panic . &quot;
other experts ar@@ gues that a lack of financial markets would so@@ othing the financial markets because they would act the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on good ways to increase the sentence by 0,25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow progression of mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and in early summer , that in this year despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , the improvement on the labour market in this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate sank to 5.5 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level , which sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
wage boo@@ sts have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly under the end of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives stated that the main reason had the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope higher interest rates and needs them due to tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world summ@@ ed up the end of last month , after China had gr@@ aded its currency . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial verage was worth more than 16 % among his peak , as investors feared that there would be a slo@@ wing of the Chinese economy global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered something in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now about 10 % below the w@@ ednesday of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives , the market turbul@@ ence influence the complex calculation , when you increase the interest . &quot;
&quot; if the events on financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks would not be occurred , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former associates of the U.S. state . &quot;
&quot; today , he predicted that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts on U.S. economy and there are almost no reliable information that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the global health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in their decision making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
&quot; the mere suggestion of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ hardt in 2013 that the F@@ ed could be in@@ cum@@ bent on its mon@@ et@@ eth@@ ic expansion , &quot; causing the turbul@@ ence around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly driven by the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives , they may not only monitor the developments at other locations , but also consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ech@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , leader of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that are apparently linked to economic tools . &quot;
&quot; head@@ acker , established member of the Federal Open Market Committee , campaign@@ ing for a Zin@@ oph@@ ment , deci@@ ph@@ oned decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia launched the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest in three sessions , despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; L@@ acker said . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives were und@@ o these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market collaboration in 2008 , as Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on interest rates of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; most recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come to the proximity of this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of a Zin@@ sion , because markets continued to rise up , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; Federal Reserve Act still has double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should be hur@@ ry . &quot;

even with its 74 L@@ enzen they are still involved .
every Thursday she does it in asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the very different lesson is being considered at a real school . &quot;
Brazilian community Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian organization SP@@ RS is trying to clarify in a sho@@ cking manner of women on how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , who are painted to fr@@ ing@@ es which have been painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which babies provide all nutrients they need to establish a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get out to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake around 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results pointed out that a higher cal@@ orie intake not the only way in which we can make the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and they protect them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the Council of Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million euros of expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat@@ ter for the solar system .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ forum comes step by step : in the recent municipal council meeting the revised Baumeister meeting had made without great discussions .
&quot; in other things , the panel had such a request for an existing legal exception &quot; &quot; Liber@@ ation &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; , &quot; it was the permission for a special form on the construction construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore a &quot; saddle d@@ ach should be built with non @-@ affiliated First and Dach@@ stein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the attic for solar systems : &quot; &quot; this means we get a wonderfully large southern exposure , &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; in turn , went to the attic , which is due to energy reasons - different from the development plan - under 10 degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore needed because the development plan relating to the roof point is no &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the cor@@ ding of the community is usually more restric@@ tive , more restric@@ tive is more restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; princip@@ als , however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we are not creating preced@@ ence , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the turn@@ around at the Sports Center is a joint project of the municipality and of SV Bern@@ ried .
roughly 2.3 million euros are included in costs .
supplements are expected from school and br@@ aking production .
the next step conclu@@ des the building contract for the 18 x 36 meters large hall now submitted to the landsc@@ ap@@ e- to the test .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is expected to close earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new physician to the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the people run from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with head to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of hospital GmbH of the county , in front of the Land@@ mark Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , one decision on the decision of the Super@@ visory Board , and the t@@ urses on the coming Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are to be put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work . &quot;
the vast majority were to move by fishermen and from the continuing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
&quot; the employees , which can not be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered in Wei@@ l@@ heim a workplace , says Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the staff are kept informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practices in direct proximity of hospital . &quot;
&quot; when the question of who is to set out the follow @-@ up , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; went into the game that she agreed to take over the leadership from 1 October , and to switch to his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is used in any case a &quot; &quot; de@@ valuation &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the range in &quot; &quot; inner medicine &quot; , &quot; says Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ white . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for cardi@@ ac makers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inner station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; in addition to the next two years , fishermen with his team , when the Super@@ visory Board will head that both houses lead , until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ hood , that still has 35 beds in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg , after nearly 140 years , has definitely been closed . &quot;
&quot; so far , the county did this plan for 2018 when the ongoing refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is closed . &quot;
&quot; governor of Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , who is also chairman of the Super@@ visory Board , joined con@@ fes@@ sions to which the house , which is owned by the federal state , is in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I shall conclude there . &quot; &quot; as it goes with the real estate , Jo@@ ch@@ ner would not say , there may be several thoughts . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term maintenance of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; so Fischer over the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who had been positive and very comprehen@@ sible by the staff . &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a chief executive for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of medical director .
&quot; in recent decades the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) had repeatedly been threatened by closing , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the birth@@ aid . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions have been demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) in the Berg@@ ischer HC .
&quot; the leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal , the clear favorite , cause for arrogan@@ ce , however , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; in the last season , the swimm@@ ers for the B@@ HC moved into a painful defeat and had something g@@ utz@@ ing there . &quot;

&quot; how exactly it could come to the accident , it was initially unclear . &quot;
the crime police was established .

&quot; a fact that has led the police for the funeral of the most Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
&quot; in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of the 20 year @-@ old , the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
one of the last 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate has been fallen victim to violence .
&quot; the cor@@ pse of young woman was found at Tu@@ es@@ ausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , like the prosec@@ ution and the Police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the same time , one also applies to the evening , 20 @-@ year @-@ old , which is in fact the indication that according to it , and the investig@@ ator led to the location of the body . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning after they arrived at home on the eve of a fall in rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a autumn .
&quot; in the search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first came to personal items of the victim . &quot;
&quot; for respon@@ dents in the friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the surv@@ ey@@ ed , there was finally a suspic@@ ion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the pre@@ emin@@ ent perpet@@ r@@ ator led the police to a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; the bi@@ ases issued the authorities in the police force , who killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old , and gave the cor@@ pse into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be lead on Wednesday to the harbour of the harbour , the investig@@ ators put it down to the load . &quot;
a decision on the near@@ er circumstances of action should bring the next investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns before residential gap
the location on the German residential market is tense .
more and more refugees are searching for an inexpensive place .
the pressure on the apartment market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution fighters in the German residential area have long ago begun .
&quot; with the immigration and seeking refugees from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market which is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
it will compete with income @-@ minded people for the last paid apartments .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , would have to be built until 2020 each year 40@@ 0.000 new units . &quot;
&quot; in this outcome , a study on behalf of the Sub@@ mit &apos;s &quot; social housing &quot; comes . &quot;
&quot; to compare , in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0.000 apartments . &quot;
&quot; refugees after the first three months of their stay are no longer oblig@@ ated , than asylum seek@@ ers in an initial order . &quot;
many then come across the apartment market and run into the long sn@@ akes in front of the apartment rentals .
&quot; according to the Federal Chanc@@ ellery , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers dwelt . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the residential area lies not only at the increasing chain of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant reconciliation in housing policies of recent years .
&quot; Germany , a residential deficit stood before itself , which is getting bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently , in the metropol@@ itan areas already approximately 77@@ 0,000 units , complain Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many of the workforce therefore dwelt in large cities in WG rooms .
young adults stayed because of the har@@ p@@ ent on the apartment market un@@ optional longer in the &quot; hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities the number of square meters per head in the past years has declined in the first time .
&quot; to solve the problem , the coalition &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; suggests a new start . &quot;
new incentives for social housing should be reg@@ ained again .
&quot; thus , the income tax could be disp@@ ens@@ ed and the tax tax for funded apartments will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; also , according to alliances , attractive tax @-@ impl@@ ements are necessary . &quot;
the sponsorship programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the State Bank K@@ f@@ W is already working well in towns and villages .
&quot; a good week after the start was announced on the fitting evening with 184 million euros , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be pushed . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia have to cor@@ ridor cor@@ ridor
&quot; after Hungary , practically no one crossed over , we are always choosing more refugees on the way across Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces announ@@ cing the transit of Slovenia to north without hur@@ dles .
&quot; nevertheless , the route is still dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to present themselves with neighbouring country on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian interior Minister , and if it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
&quot; after the deport@@ ation of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and reported the Croatian TV station .
Hungary had gr@@ ated its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , do not make occasional asylum procedures in Hungary practically super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia does not want to let the refugees pass .
&quot; Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; you can go through , and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and do something . &quot;
&quot; however , people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police arrived at the border of Serbia in Serbia on the morning at the border of Serbia .
&quot; the most recent media reported by Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have sought to walk on the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; along the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees did not come across the border . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the bor@@ ver@@ ges of other dangers : there are still sharp Min@@ es from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
Min@@ en@@ sers are going to quickly create a safe passage .
after the closure of the border there is hardly any more refugees .
on Tuesday numbered the police 36@@ 6 re@@ en@@ ched people .
just before the gate on Monday it was 9@@ 380 was there .
the new Hungarian laws are the overcoming and def@@ ective of the border of us as a crime .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border of Sz@@ eged only 35 criminal procedures were initiated .
condemned pen@@ alties for up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday in the newly established authorities on Tuesday we set up a total of 94 asymmet@@ ry contracts , nearly all - 93 - the most important transition . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with young children and two older people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees stopped .
&quot; however , no one has no more views to be given in Hungary asylum . &quot;
&quot; after this opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ pi@@ ed asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees were gathered . &quot;
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to return . &quot;
&quot; they gathered the gar@@ bage , the tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side . &quot;
pl@@ agues were re@@ constructed and one of the recording at the border town was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express for the goal of this building .
&quot; after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees arrive . &quot;
the country also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around the 20,000 migrants kept themselves to government resources , but still in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the return to Germany .
train transport from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the request of the German authorities .
in Frei@@ l@@ ass@@ ing regularly met smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor of &quot; Ges@@ tr@@ and@@ ete &quot; about the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the dre@@ aming , when suddenly ten people stood with travel to the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists ; they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; because Germany was initially conf@@ isc@@ ated on Sunday because of the refugee stream of railway traffic with Austria , was for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , the town , which immediately offered its help and ch@@ aired along with two further hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the south of Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we saw the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only once , with coffee and drink . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; says the town in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; a man did not let him get to pass a generous donation : 100 Euro for the fire@@ men &quot; fire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; Th@@ is@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the move @-@ passengers were on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in a regional train heading towards Pass@@ au , in order to set the railway traffic to Germany after the short notice , yet to try the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was placed on the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
the cross @-@ border in W@@ ern@@ stein is generally high in the course .
the Br@@ ücken@@ fest association with the bay@@ er@@ isches neighbours on Sunday on Sunday - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; now , Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending more information to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping at the Camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke right away in the formation of structures to ensure human labour , our Chancellor has been highly publi@@ ci@@ zed and publicly backed by the attitude of the Hungarian government in the arena of National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
do@@ ings of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing the border areas with chaotic conditions .
&quot; the p@@ oul@@ try they must find that the &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a major challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and approaching winter , in us to make decent conditions for protective devices . &quot;
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35.@@ 000 hi@@ ber@@ winter@@ ing Quar@@ ry
Konrad has all hands full with the refugee of all hands .
Christian Konrad is used to be that his Word has weight .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker to launch the refugees for thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the Fir@@ st@@ ree centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a handle on hand .
&quot; we do not have homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great hosts , said Konrad and praised the organisational performance . &quot;
the ministry also spoke of a &quot; cryp@@ tic situation . &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad with a capacity of 8@@ 5,000 minerals in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number we have to be found in the next weeks even 35.@@ 000 accommodations - 20,000 to provide the countries , 15,000 the Bund . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can manage it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the occup@@ ants .
&quot; they would have secured to create , even for the coming refugees quot@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP of VP supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born in the morning we will explain how the Church will help .
&quot; great expectations makes the asylum @-@ ordinator even in the OR@@ F action , &quot; Hel@@ ps like us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform individuals can offer accommodations .
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels , which will be empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of need , it could not be that lod@@ g@@ ings have to respect a certain height of the hand @-@ stri@@ ker or the size of the super@@ visory authority . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary time , &quot; &quot; not@@ standards &quot; &quot; apply . &quot;
&quot; that he is successful in the opposition to the ministry for the establishment of successful talks , Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentl@@ eman , which one cannot without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier cause the Republic no cost , as they did . &quot;
you want to increase the number of employees in three to four .
my own source search has not been successful until now .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at Steph@@ an@@ splatz in office .
but there are obviously problems with the permit .
Linz calls for better distribution
&quot; first , no opening of municipal sports facilities and other buildings like tips and design center for accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary for the moment as the person concerned at present without these measures , &quot; said Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , for the emergency purposes , further sites should be checked on their num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
criticism of the Chief of the refugees on the division of refugees within the Federal Republic of Germany .
other areas must make their contribution here .
&quot; seals , &quot; &quot; borders are not gr@@ ated &quot;
in a longer call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) is the main shareholder Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday further action in the refugee quot@@ ation .
&quot; above , the sea level in@@ sured me that the German borders cannot be gr@@ ated . &quot;
the further development of refugees in the Federal Republic would continue to be possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no more inter@@ acts with refugees after Germany won &apos;t be any more .
&quot; however , the addi@@ ctions would have led to Germany with regular ones . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , he called for once more strengthened solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; that Austria has now re@@ trac@@ ed Austria to its border controls , is for ag@@ it@@ ators &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the procedure of the Germans . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the general reconstruction of the &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; at the Lin@@ zer Industrial grid is officially completed .
&quot; four of the six floors of office building and production building is the listed IT group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is supposed to be rented to young , innovative enterprises from the supplier . &quot;
&quot; in IT , we are intelligent minds - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ Chef Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he can imagine , in starting up @-@ to @-@ date companies in the New W@@ ship@@ yard , and later on which to buy . &quot;
&quot; even from the on@@ set to S &amp; T to collaborate with the new neighbors - the Nieder@@ haus@@ er hopes : &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.1 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros of the Tech@@ center , each one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building stands out from Linz AG for 60 years by S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters in the building are rented , for another 40 percent give it requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened a second shop in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ Hand@@ bags are in the center of attention .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta really wanted to put a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to shift the 49 @-@ year @-@ old in@@ mates of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the bar@@ be@@ markt Ark@@ ad circuit , &quot; finally she has now gained growth in the form of another business local . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop in front of the business , in which it is sold among other po@@ ckets , suit@@ case , shoes and gar@@ ment of different manufacturers , now all about Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now 75 Euro to have . &quot;
&quot; bigger pan@@ ni@@ ers and accessories are up to 500 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks has been renovated . &quot;
&quot; but I have passed away for a long time , if I still want to open a store , &quot; says broad . &quot;
&quot; decisive factors for the decision was , among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of a private location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the s@@ alty in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who himself has its Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion @-@ interest has placed wide from her mother into the cradle .
&quot; most importantly , when something emerg@@ es and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
why so some woman could be in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag if so may the busin@@ ess@@ men could not be able to answer the last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag will be upgraded in each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the fal@@ si@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants would be called for .
this characteristic links some also with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US @-@ president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for set @-@ off .
&quot; whether he is spoken out of foreign @-@ hos@@ tile , journalists or scientists in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential Office wir@@ led the elec@@ toral campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts well down .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ al K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property with milli@@ ard . &quot;
the New Yorker with the cas@@ ing @-@ style is a term in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine @-@ road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is above @-@ heart@@ ed corners of it is related .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election campaign . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do vill@@ agers think about its aim of becoming more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I believe that somehow they find that somehow exciting , but are not deeply impressed in their K@@ hu@@ ts , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed a am@@ using film about the place and its famous spr@@ ing@@ lings that next to Tru@@ mp is also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz .
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ est@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too word - so with the statement that he would certainly have been successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
and to the king of the heart he did not put it there .
&quot; although I give respect for the power of the family , but also I tend to think that Tru@@ mp is already a bit &apos; W@@ alled &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; acci@@ dental of the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too high German : the bra@@ in@@ ees , says it . &quot;
the Tru@@ mp Com@@ es comes from the village of the in@@ ees .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for the min@@ er . &quot;
basic stone of the property group were first property purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from Trag@@ ik : your wish , to return to the home , resign@@ ed at the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Pfalz belonged then at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not initi@@ ate Tru@@ mp because he was once granted approval without permission , the Director of the Institute for pf@@ alz History and Economics , Roland Paul , explained to the film start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes important statements of the follow @-@ up statements .
&quot; he repeated repe@@ ating on Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border line , so called for illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; just as the pol@@ tert , that is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relationship Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; The gran@@ ny was one @-@ born Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ egro@@ wer in retirement looks the American more dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so enligh@@ tening . &quot;
does he believes that Tru@@ mp Com@@ es ?
&quot; this can I not imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never looked at around K@@ all@@ stadt , Germany . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ ra@@ tin Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz ended with a visit something for the F@@ athers , which is generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; this can I not imagine of the Donald , &quot; said the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they f@@ ences it better if he won &apos;t win the choice , because &quot; he has such a radical view , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had been the trouble at the time of his grandfather in the US , were as he had , &quot; &quot; he would never be there at all . &quot;
&quot; there is more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not it &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pe even without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot;

&quot; Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , in spite of the attempts of N@@ ine , the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra came to report on the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but it has no major shifts in the reviews of today . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the Bundes@@ liga as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Saman@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , sc@@ aled in London as part of a we@@ ekl@@ ong series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the board seemed to no part in the Australian TV broadcast , as Sun@@ rise scored an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spect@@ ators with five major capitals , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase compared with the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in the last few months the gap has been opened to Sun@@ rise .
&quot; in August today , an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance ran between 4@@ 0.000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; in September , Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9.@@ 000 spect@@ ators to 3@@ 14.@@ 000 . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happened every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning - more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Serial star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ son Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama of a recent twe@@ et father , who dis@@ closes , met with his two children at the New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators . &quot;
critics had asked whether Thom@@ son took a hit @-@ show Solo without the rafting star Rebecca Gib@@ son .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; YES &quot; .
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1,@@ 136 million spect@@ ators and hit slightly The block ( 8@@ 38.@@ 000 ) and T@@ B@@ L Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
Seven had mixed results on the evening two from The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 ) of the new Quiz show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e revealed on average 44@@ 6.000 spect@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23,@@ 000 spect@@ ators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; the first half hour from The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spect@@ ators and in the second half an hour s@@ atte 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
hot @-@ seat above 6@@ 20,000 .

the last three votes in One : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret un@@ vei@@ led ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have ignor@@ ant who The Bachelor holds . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood continues in The Bachelor , finally , was covered in greatest intelligence . &quot;
and none of the three left @-@ loved girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , then you possibly acci@@ dentally provided an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues its lips until the Fin@@ als on Thursday sealed
&quot; all three women dropped in ly@@ rical way about why wood is the perfect man and acquain@@ t@@ ances his sense of humor , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be like his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who was supposed to get the last rose ? , &quot; could their answers to the game of play , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki no@@ ises both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had one simple relationship in the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies spot@@ ted , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I thought it throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the correct chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home @-@ visit last week made her clear that wood &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear that this is obviously not just a game - I am now shut down on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose which wood should choose , if not they , there it was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left @-@ loved girls equally - it is a deci@@ de@@ dly between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor &apos;s degree is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30h , by Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams , who sent to their impressive open training days at the end of last year . &quot;
&quot; but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula , and it looks like a clever decision . &quot;
&quot; some coach would have known Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank , when he lost a lack of angel , as it did the Aussie Ru@@ g@@ by League entries at his first p@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return a p@@ unt return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula showed its true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of having a ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team through the mill , it encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne on his press conference in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam ri@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams Co@@ ordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey to forget his conc@@ eal F@@ ang and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t in a P@@ unt which was restored in the first game district of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian warfare for his N@@ FL @-@ debut . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble flood the playing field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not have imagined a more difficult start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was an thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne made the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ ate in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Queensland .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters require a capacity of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to high Refu@@ ge@@ es .
&quot; party and leader of Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger had war@@ ned at the start of the F@@ W @-@ autumn cl@@ or@@ ship at Bay@@ erns schools at the start of a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , when there is a new teacher for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to help schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get testim@@ onials in the Bav@@ arian educational system . &quot;
the bonds of the Free voters dis@@ h@@ unted down to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Comm@@ une .
actually very other main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees also domin@@ ates the free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lap &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of UN @-@ protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it did during the Yugoslavia in the N@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it is not going on , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot;
&quot; for asylum seek@@ ers , the Free voters want to postp@@ one as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts , who are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ dres@@ ser , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W director cri@@ tici@@ zed that several states are not consistent , &quot; we are nation@@ alized nation@@ wide standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria Sli@@ des , others not . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we must be able to act . &quot;
&quot; however , the national policy of the Grand @-@ W@@ ang does not fall under the table . &quot;
a long@@ anger of continu@@ ance remains on the agenda : the policy of the policy .
&quot; for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) launched the pilot &quot; &quot; Mittel@@ alter@@ ing &quot; &quot; level plus &quot; , &quot; with which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ alen phase has been tested by three to four years - the result it takes on nine years to finish . &quot;
but this is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W @-@ Chief . &quot;
we call for freedom of freedom for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that want to .
free travel at G@@ 9 everywhere where it is desired .

the discussion about the bur@@ dens from the nuclear phase has left the shares of RW@@ E at the time to record a record deep and left a deep strike on eon .
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy p@@ ans perhaps costs 30 billion euros on post@@ ural . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures quoted in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy concerns successfully recovered something , but ultimately still lost several times ( RW@@ E ) and 6.6 percent ( eon ) . &quot;
&quot; Infin@@ eon shares are on the D@@ ax tip , by another 3,@@ 22 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the U.S. &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; magazine continued from the weekend to . &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen rub@@ bers on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal when the police were killed in a crowd , which demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke down in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , at least 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , headed District Apostles , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered out of a police station , with some of you stones and fire bom@@ bs . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have employed Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot into the air before they handle rubber .
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were wo@@ unded , said he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rub@@ ber@@ ate @-@ fin , of which is known that they can indeed kill , but which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , apparently causing so high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the discussion was the last in weeks of non @-@ violent protest in Nep@@ al@@ ese levels , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi can say that new provinces , which would be formed within the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Thal@@ arus who want to have their own state .
&quot; minimum 40 people , including 11 police officers , were dealt with in violent sho@@ cks since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been built for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way , but the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthqu@@ akes that had killed in April thousands of people . &quot;
&quot; the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors have voted this week about certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional Court , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

&quot; under the pressure of the project cri@@ tic and the F@@ DP group , which pre@@ clu@@ sters the investors and the administration of secret services , Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends from the System @-@ Bau management into the offensive : &quot; we still didn &apos;t answer all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and over 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
that plans for some ten to twelve million Euros has been in discussion for months .
&quot; fier@@ ce reactions among sea owners , who had come to the meeting , have emerged the pictures and new details to the desired hotel structure . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and executive director in the interests of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ utter that over@@ looks the other hand . &quot;
&quot; moreover , he feared as some other project critics , that traffic through the intended size of the plant would be increased : &quot; &quot; there must be full b@@ umps , so that the traffic deals . &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the good one h@@ ect@@ are of the former Gast@@ stätte , is however still open . &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; only we have to present a conclusi@@ ve concept , &quot; said Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends . &quot;

Google starts up @-@ to @-@ line donations to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL .

Google has a un@@ usually personal approach to the announ@@ cing of the don@@ ating call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google co @-@ employee who has been flo@@ wn with her family from Kab@@ ul than she was seven years old about her personal experience . &quot;
&quot; in our trip there were many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and anxiety , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family des@@ perate for help . &quot;
&quot; donations are given four non @-@ profit organisations , providing assistance for refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High @-@ Com@@ miss@@ ary for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global funds raised to $ 5,@@ 5 million to googl@@ e.@@ g / mi@@ tigation on 11 million $ . &quot;
&quot; Europe has been confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four@@ teen @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many refugees from the war broke down in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;
coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; working by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easy wei@@ ghty di@@ abe@@ tics you can be wei@@ ght@@ post surgery helpful .
the benefits of weight loss for easy overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to say whether easy to live overweight people with diabetes after weight loss of weight than those who do not get @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death dates need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a leading article on the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss treatment or obesity , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years , Adi@@ pos@@ &apos;s operations have proven to be effective in the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out by people who are coron@@ ary fat @-@ only with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be fat .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity and magn@@ ets . to medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes in people , which were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation sun@@ k from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I was with the one that non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments received almost immediately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who subjected to a surgical procedure , the most up to 36 % the diabetes condition was entirely and at 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes is completely only at one percent and in part with only approximately two percent . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the results were conducted in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol . generally better in the &quot; &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the ble@@ eding values in the course of time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 per cent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level sank from approximately 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you see in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mortality rate of five years , so the director Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also ad@@ orn@@ ate average results in the two kinds of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass Sur@@ gery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater revers@@ als of BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study reveals no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are hints from a study of heavy people in Sweden , that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was subjected to obes@@ e people who have under@@ gone around 29 percent less probably in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it is so@@ othing to persons with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone was added that people and their doctors were supposed to take weight seriously once the patient lies with its BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting for too long , until we bring people this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is an issue that is currently taking care in fiction : a young woman , too popular and un@@ ans@@ ed , meet after years the flock of her youth again , and he fell in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently @-@ oriented novel &quot; actually we are not so &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der .
&quot; on the love of love , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ re readers , for it takes place in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ lived author is grown in Lang@@ weiler and was pleased that she was able to place a liter@@ ary monument in their hom@@ etown .
it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , told the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of refugee crisis in the Middle East do not lie . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist guide invited to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visits in the United Kingdom in his speech on occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford interested in Eth@@ ics Studies .
&quot; he demanded that under given circumstances the interests of humanity should be confronted with the interests of individual nations , or even continents . &quot;
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is admir@@ able to the refugee crisis but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but meanwhile you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries can be created , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the attack of 11 September and found out that the violent response from the US moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after 11 September I have expressed my p@@ ity in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he made violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of in@@ ges@@ tion inf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the last 4 years
&quot; tox@@ icity centers in the United States report on an almost 400 per cent increase in the number of children under 12 years , the strong beverage infectious agent , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of manual inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years are reported Po@@ ison Control Systems , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more frequent to these products , and unfortunately lan@@ ded a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children can do dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do they do to impress your friends or for a mut@@ ation on social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a budget hotel .
young people have alleg@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft outh@@ wash to get a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be sw@@ allowed by attractive sc@@ ents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are saving .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange du@@ ps which are very appealing for children . &quot;
tr@@ aying inf@@ ect@@ ants contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with small children can be able to lead a few spr@@ inkl@@ ers to the alco@@ hol@@ s .
&quot; it is highly concentrated , told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ic Centre at the University of K@@ ansas , radio stations Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let go ho@@ ky whis@@ ky but people allow this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and if children are coming from it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which had recently taken four sp@@ lash of the trailer for straw@@ berry in school , was brought into a not@@ ebook . &quot;
&quot; your blood @-@ low concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold in other than dr@@ unk , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ebook doctor who treated it in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah stran@@ ts her words and was unable to walk when they arrived in the not@@ ebook .
&quot; doctors over@@ looked them overnight in a separate children &apos;s disease at the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and told her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal to my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
about alco@@ hol@@ ism out there were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with fat@@ alities .
&quot; in 2013 two women died in Ontario , after the sh@@ u@@ cks of Hän@@ de@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which had a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ect that the product meth@@ anol has contained a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl@@ al@@ co@@ hol , which was noted as a ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January the three students of the fourth classes in the state New York were planned to det@@ ox@@ i@@ fy their &quot; &quot; teachers &quot; &quot; by organizing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to Hän@@ de@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and Verb@@ ates them from their space .
the police assessed the scheme as &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; and rejected actions to the school authority .

the lack of a cover competition in the Scottish Football Sho@@ lt Nieder@@ ers - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and past National @-@ player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er has said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic because there is no title @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently a amb@@ assador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no high points of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not present .
people here are talking not just about the return of the R@@ angers .
you are talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m Games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;

&quot; Dei@@ la said : &quot; Celtic had had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel the exact same thing - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need really the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while increasing the UK as a whole .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period from May to July unchanged for 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people employed without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period as a whole to around 10,000 million . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.5 per cent was below the U@@ CS of 5.5 per cent as the figures of the office for National Statisti@@ cs ( s ) showed .
&quot; in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell to 12.000 throughout the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.6@@ ,000 . &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland fell over the course of the quar@@ als at 7@@ 4.3 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .

&quot; the invitation took place in January for the first time in January of his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a great opportunity to tell the entire story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists will be able to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and as many times more applicants are available for applications , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery will take place to decide which is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five .

&quot; the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and record a pen what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it and you will get access . &quot;
I describe me with her .
&quot; they de@@ votes you that they could have done it better , but they still think it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ sip had problems with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international re@@ por@@ ter is present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work against the death penalty will help . &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ viewer of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts which I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ ary is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe it is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters who can turn to for this .
&quot; what you get from me is , what it means to see a man an unnecessary death . &quot;
&quot; man after the hum@@ id police fire @-@ hunt , to get out of the C@@ anning River &quot;
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Pol@@ z@@ ist remained dry as he sp@@ ake the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang down the police was un@@ successful , when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , tried just a few meters from a police officers , trying to lead him gently to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was created on Tuesday to a household break@@ down in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , it tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come so far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and hol , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Spin@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making its uni@@ form@@ ass , so he turned a reliable tactics - &quot; A good police force . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine . &quot;
master@@ ship @-@ soccer player Ben cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , Cou@@ ber@@ ner took his car in the dit@@ ch to go to an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired local people to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben cou@@ sins @-@ bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moody argu@@ ed that Stew@@ art tried to sp@@ y him and to end the racing sport
Peter Moody argu@@ ed that stew@@ ards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables in the past year to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he moved on the stew@@ ards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and maintained that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last stra@@ w . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what best for the racing sport and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt pick@@ ess in Li@@ dar@@ i that he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had returned 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age alleg@@ ations and did not want it , that &quot; &quot; see how too high fir@@ ing grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had before nothing to say about it , and I have long to eat , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything is coming out at once , &quot; said Moody &quot;
they know that it is ongoing .
&quot; sometimes people re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk in the main , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they begin to think , I do not do it , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think carefully what I do with my license .
previously Moody the bom@@ b had tried in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ ity department had tried to sp@@ y his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him a work in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moody &quot; rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a fraud .
&quot; if that is the case , they certainly ought to put on their n@@ oses because they try to hold me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , am@@ ore President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should I bring this to the view that it becomes personally ?
&quot; did the RV@@ L be che@@ ered out , and perhaps does people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so badly for the industry ?
perhaps the people think that I am .
&quot; perhaps they must take my license and rep@@ el me , and I have no doubt that what I say , they now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where I didn &apos;t care about , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push her to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the train@@ ee level of the coach will be built with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led that he might throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody &apos;s best known for his preparation of the un@@ promised master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , signed the racing @-@ treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse , which arose against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is opposed to the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has broken down mud on the ball .
it could have been yesterday evening so .
it could have been the whole day yesterday so it was .
it was also so on the race day .
Moody &apos;s could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the racing day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; people who place these rules , do nothing about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see one that we need rules but here you have come too far &quot; &quot; Moody &apos;s . &quot;
Mann to B@@ urs@@ ed he was arrested
&quot; the police on the weekend have arrested a man after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist , and subsequent acc@@ urs@@ ed in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was handed over with the helic@@ opter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious bre@@ aches after it was hit by a car on the Satur@@ day@@ tomorrow on the Murray Valley .
&quot; the police said , the mot@@ orists continued to stop , without stopping , in order to help the last rider . &quot;
on Monday a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia is the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for acc@@ urs@@ ed and lo@@ wered assistance and due to other traffic ra@@ dishes .

Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy battles against Riv@@ alen because of alleg@@ ations for Ring@@ vor@@ s
Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has declared critic@@ isms of the tac@@ tical as an &apos; Agenda &apos; of Two Premier League &apos;s Favorites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee won the Stor@@ m players &quot; Ring@@ vor@@ fs &quot; with his team during the high Stor@@ m victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised comment to the Stor@@ m team , after his team had scored the final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland are not &quot; good &quot; in rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy , the &quot; &quot; T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g &quot; &quot; defended his team and said that it is focused on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; only on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy , he added that the cri@@ tique of two leaders in his team will tell him confident as it was be@@ asts that they are worried , from the Stor@@ m team . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s always emerg@@ es - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talk about Ring@@ vor@@ es , when she defeated us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed in the whole year nothing at our defensive system or techniques . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es a real emphasis and this has provided for us the trend revers@@ al . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to lose acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny , as this is always up to this time of time . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy , Benn@@ ett has attacked the &quot; exciting football &quot; and remember his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Ill@@ awar@@ ra Dragon won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he was compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St. George was born to George as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play it and that we look at an exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play as this . &quot;
&quot; I build a stronger trust , because they say these things because they are a bit worried they must play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think of us when the big games went .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Stor@@ m vs Roo@@ ster had a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of bronze was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and don &apos;t have any points any cl@@ amping ?
to me it is the schedu@@ les .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase yet again . &quot;
&quot; the Stor@@ m team has won this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys , or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ k on the next Saturday night in A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales begin from next morning . &quot;
wat@@ ering with 200@@ .000 $ deposit for drug promise
&quot; a man who might be a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence threatened because of its su@@ ction , in the possession of 40 kilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were fu@@ elled after Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police were 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic has been watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the course of the court and later at the Cafe Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse where the police took 40 kilo@@ grams of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a potentially li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for an attempt to possess a commercial co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there may be no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the cafe may have been due to a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the strongh@@ old of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
for a criminal off@@ ence he made the police over his place of residence .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and ep@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the final statements made by the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judge F@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent it from them , not to appear , war@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against deposit , under the conditions that he ob@@ serves his Australian and its Serbian pass , with@@ holding their Australian and Ser@@ b pass , holding off at an cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analyzed then computer that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; web research , which were used for searching for un@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g claimed it against the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; P@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile on the internet , &quot; and he then , &quot; a polic@@ eman to be scar@@ ed to sc@@ are her . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor of E@@ ili@@ ie Robert@@ son said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction , - that he is addi@@ ctive , to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he gave to that the addi@@ ctions on the computer were conducted by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; he was asked about his talks with the un@@ familiar person who sent him the pictures , and which he asked even more photos . &quot;
he said he did to enti@@ ce them .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he dro@@ wns , and said , he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Robert@@ son added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at tre@@ m@@ bling and on top . &quot;
then also saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and made the accused .
&quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computers and Play@@ station used to talk to girls , who saw much younger than him . &quot;

the mass does &apos; s : every two years show the car@@ ver on the I@@ AA its innovations .
2015 especially exercise in the compact car which are currently especially well used .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : about 28.@@ 1 % of new registr@@ ations ac@@ counted by the Federal Chanc@@ ellery ( KBA ) alone in August at this segment .
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( audience on 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , between all the futur@@ istic concept @-@ witnesses and new luxury cars and luxury cars will be presented primarily to many new compact models this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest Premi@@ xes for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astr@@ a , which will be on sale at the deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astr@@ a is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel @-@ CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the heart of the brand .
&quot; so the volume model is also sold well , the new Astr@@ a is also not much more expensive for it . &quot;
&quot; Opel is an entry below the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 Euros . &quot;
&quot; the current Astr@@ a costs from 7,@@ 990 € . &quot;
the Astr@@ a is available with a new 1,@@ 4 l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 b@@ hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse further diesel and gas@@ oline engines of 70 kW / 95 HP up to 147 kW / / 200 b@@ hp on , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gas@@ oline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel is the Opel Astr@@ a first only as five @-@ fifth . &quot;
&quot; as a second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is also visible on the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will be re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated next to Astr@@ a at the I@@ AA still on new comp@@ actors ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astr@@ a ri@@ vals Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively five @-@ fifth in a conventional and a stressed sports GT @-@ version .
&quot; in trade he comes to trade at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Abl@@ eger wants to find his position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; at the same time , the compact Infin@@ iti is adapting with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the base model will get a gas@@ oline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 HP or 125 kW / 170 PS .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celeb@@ rates its world premiere .
&quot; the model is offered with gas@@ oline engines , including a newly developed 1,0 @-@ l@@ iter @-@ bom@@ bs and a power of 82 kW / 111 HP . &quot;
the maximum torque is about 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno nation in Europe 2016 is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the comp@@ actor @-@ assembled model DS 4 , which is shown on the I@@ AA . &quot;
outside the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Abl@@ eg@@ ers above all laid hands at the front part : here the refriger@@ ation was newly drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch@@ screen and for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the I@@ AA can spread out a series of re@@ work@@ ings and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht has given an explosion of hazardous de@@ pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary to@@ wing , which is used to accommod@@ ated in a small cell once a month . &quot;
&quot; because of the injury of their human dignity , in@@ mates are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation unless they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this was the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
those affected may even be hop@@ ed for money if they were im@@ pris@@ oned only a few days in the too tight spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ prisoner with his Constitutional Treaty was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Berlin @-@ T@@ egel between June and November 2009 into a single cell , with approximately five square meters floor space ; the toilet was spatial @-@ spatial . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to the reference of his lawyer , then , was now on an open base , in a greater cell . &quot;
his Am@@ t@@ sh@@ aft@@ ungs@@ kl@@ age because of the un@@ worthy liability @-@ conditions against the country Berlin fails .
&quot; however , the constitutional treaty took the judgment of the chamber in Berlin and exp@@ elled the case for renewed examination . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s man in@@ ju@@ red .
Kam@@ mer@@ Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; if for legal reasons , if for legal reasons , only a few days of det@@ ention to compensation are made of decisive importance , be a equi@@ voc@@ ally , was it meant . &quot;
&quot; failing would be &quot; &quot; a shor@@ th@@ inner of the law to fear the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kam@@ mer@@ Court must now clarify the height of the joint development .
the constitutional system have often pushed the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; thus , they said first in April a prisoner of damage , because he was im@@ pris@@ oned in a cell . &quot;
&quot; human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , as well as the multi @-@ fac@@ ul@@ acy of a cell without a separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court , the Berlin Constitutional Court , that had agreed to an an@@ ew in a parall@@ el@@ ic book in November 2009 . &quot;
the former inter@@ r@@ ack@@ et was held over three months from 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were also coming to the head@@ lines within the last few weeks .
&quot; therefore , again and again 23 hours included , the aggressi@@ vity is rising , even to bat , it is because of the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information of the judicial press@@ ors , 21 bodies in T@@ egel are not occupied , 19 should not fall out . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers may come to Germany by forecasts up by the Federal Ministry for Germany , following statement by vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SD@@ P ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated the un@@ common challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can create that and we create that .
what is coming on Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; after different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of State ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el institute ) apartments every year - and the next five years long . &quot;
that is almost twice as much as it is built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatically , the lack of housing but mainly in payable flats : yearly fall 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 people from the rental property , and around these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SD@@ P ) does therefore want to double the promotion , from currently 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is to be made from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 Social @-@ apartments every year , and this federal government would have to invest in funding 6,@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; in agreement , scientists and the Federal Minister agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for labour market and vocational research , 55 percent of the p@@ oul@@ try in Germany will be at work in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualification in order to help them get started to get started by Claudia Walter , project manag@@ ment for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find employment in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the opportunity society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the migrants , &quot; says Mig@@ rations researcher Diet@@ rich Thr@@ ot@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the throne , there has been a political shift : from working ban on refugees to recognition of labor . &quot;
&quot; while there used to be an employment bot for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the Residen@@ cy , the asylum seek@@ ers placed at one location . &quot;
&quot; in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - mostly the point of view , refugees can be enabling more rapidly access to the labour market . &quot;
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lacking interpretation .
&quot; so far , there is still no adequate supply of general and professional @-@ related language courses . &quot;
research will also show that jobs most often be convey@@ ed by personal contact .
the setting of networks is therefore into integration of the throne of the throne of the König@@ s@@ weg .
&quot; the Berlin school@@ government has found that only a few refugees fle@@ eing their children to the kite , estimated at ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the root @-@ root parents , &quot; said Il@@ ja Ko@@ ho@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butions in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increase greatly due to the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate stuck to increase the educational capacity - e.g. by allowing more trade schools . &quot;
in the countries pupils are prepared with no knowledge of teaching classes for teaching .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ airs from the Berlin school@@ administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk thinks that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no state asylum seek@@ ers or Cre@@ ating the study - the only exception was Berlin , inter@@ state Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) now has given up his position now . &quot;
studies of refugees could be facilit@@ ated to the university &apos;s university .
&quot; for refugees with a ham@@ bur@@ ial or d@@ ul@@ sion , do not receive any services after the asylum seek@@ ers &apos; Act , if they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter is in principle not a BA@@ Fö@@ G , as it does not fall under the circle of those entitled to legitimate persons . &quot;
&quot; so far refugees had to have been living in Germany for four years to be allowed to have BA@@ Fö@@ G , from January 1st 2016 , this Sp@@ anne was shor@@ tened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Under@@ secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; in future , Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many people this religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
the state should gradually collapse the same rights as they have the churches and develop the existing state @-@ churches to develop into a new state @-@ religions .
&quot; it would also be important for the formation of an Islamic welfare state , who takes care of the arri@@ vals . &quot;
among the rights are also obligations .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts some and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and set him certain control options . &quot;
&quot; also , the willingness to face down against religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who have escap@@ ed such conflicts in Germany , &quot; have immediately their right to emig@@ rate here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law to Arabic .
integration will continue to be a subject of the whole society in future .
&quot; in this way , the majority of the majority of people have to change is the reduction of discrimination and racism . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimin@@ atory work place and a general gender equality law since a scar@@ ce .
&quot; but it is slow to learn how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie showed , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motif . &quot;
&quot; equal chances for all : what Mig@@ rant organizations and stakeholders have long been demanding for long and why international agreements , such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ist prevention , has to be actu@@ alized in the next few years if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany was able to provide medi@@ cally medi@@ cally necessary refugees , who has so far as Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create &apos; , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , there are additional money to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid Eng@@ p@@ asses , ur@@ ges Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all com@@ ers directly to the registration of health cards . &quot;
brought services could later be b@@ illed with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able so many people see with the restricted power catalogue , which I see asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
otherwise make the doctors first of all the language barriers .
&quot; so far , the Berlin Medical School The@@ a Bor@@ de has been proven , migrants are poor under@@ min@@ ed about their diseases as other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical offices , would have to be taken over interpre@@ ter , she asks for . &quot;
&quot; in case of many refugees , many refugees would also be helped with more general medical lead in emergency out@@ patient . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
under refugee quot@@ ations approximately give it much more im@@ treat@@ able disabilities and among the young people there is going to be HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment .
&quot; but with the partially other health conditions , German doctors of their training came from their training but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to recognize . and what affects the causes of men , whether by the refugees perhaps even all@@ evi@@ ation in sight . &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed education system ; several refugees were even doctors .
&quot; if they are allowed to practice , however , they would have to show their qualification and probably pose again exam@@ inations . &quot;
at least half of the displ@@ ac@@ al refugees in Germany is sick of sick : the risk of psych@@ otherap@@ ists ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ic is sick : most suffering from a post@@ traum@@ atic load @-@ compul@@ sive disorder or depression .
&quot; particularly vulnerable , refugee camps , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent published study of the Technical University Munich occupies that every fifth Syrian refugees is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who are suffering in a post@@ traum@@ atic load @-@ bearing disorder , is suffering from the fl@@ ash@@ backs with respir@@ ation , s@@ win@@ dle , v@@ ases and death @-@ scar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms include sleeping , and concentr@@ ations , strong sho@@ ck@@ ness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent that the symptoms would be chron@@ ically , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of psych@@ ic patients receive refugees from psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; though , mentally ill @-@ seeking asylum in the social offices may pose a request for psych@@ otherapy , but the processing normally takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices mostly processors or doctors , who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this frequently lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; is att@@ acking the Circus and tested on the traditions of cir@@ cus .
&quot; the goal is to drag any age group into the spell of fascinating compact , wildlife dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus and tried @-@ rehear@@ sing in the ring on a brick and was@@ p to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie @-@ rehear@@ se , veterin@@ arian and Jun@@ i@@ orch@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current man@@ eg@@ en@@ st@@ aging .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus is rehear@@ sing in the hands of the family .
the gift to delight is the family in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away mankind away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , stresses the 27 @-@ year old j@@ unt@@ an . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ en@@ cock@@ tail with world @-@ air flair , &quot; thus calls the director Reinhard rehear@@ st his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 thousand kilometres long tour can now experience this lifestyle .
the program of the cir@@ cus is convinced by talented artists from all over the world .
honoured at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family leads the audience with wit and charm in its spell .
&quot; also , the Castillo Brothers understand their craft . &quot;
with the heroes of the steep films you want to record the Cub@@ an duo .
eas@@ iness and mot@@ ility - identify with these words .
your humor@@ ous art on the m@@ ast is to conquer women &apos;s heart@@ ed in storm .
&quot; except through numerous salmon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus is also fascinated with fing@@ erti@@ a and gel . &quot;
with the wheel on a ball bal@@ ancing ?
for He Yuan no problem .
sn@@ ake @-@ humans fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascinated with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; empha@@ sized Stephen , Brigitte and her . &quot;
dis@@ agreements in the attitude of cir@@ cus are just too often the issue at different animal rights organisations .
&quot; Stephanie rehear@@ st also takes position : &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals , it is also not good . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy all kinds of cu@@ dd@@ lers .
&quot; four @-@ legged Arti@@ sts , as they are lovingly called , will be read by the eyes of every desire . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; feel the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the ring . &quot;
the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals provide .
&quot; specially to her z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and one z@@ ebra @-@ mare , the family is rehear@@ sing . &quot;
the two animals have lived in a space for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , was our small Jum@@ bo since , &quot; said Brigitte rehear@@ st . &quot;
&quot; although the z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the ring , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus . &quot;
so for each visitor something is likely to be part of it .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie rehear@@ st : &quot; regardless of whether five or 1 200 spect@@ ators , we always give our best and are with all our hearts . &quot;
the Circus is rehear@@ sed from 17 to 20 September every day at 17 and 8 pm .
Sunday begins the program at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is Famili@@ entag am discounted for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock .
&quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au from 10 am to 6 pm open . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe puts wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , from Africa &apos;s elected leader , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained in@@ ju@@ red , but the video of the fall quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament also was asser@@ ted by the members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous de@@ votes and war@@ ned them to accompany the address of Mr Mu@@ gabe with the co @-@ president . &quot;
&quot; during the last month , they had extended it and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions politicians receive SMS @-@ news on their phones who war@@ ned them before that Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she has the title &quot; death &quot; , &quot; he said journalists according to the ques@@ tioning . &quot;
&quot; they war@@ ns the concerned Parliament members , that the immunity on the parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the chief spokes@@ man said , that said of Morgan T@@ sv@@ ang@@ ir@@ ai , is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to de@@ vise 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts of the company &apos;s services .
HP will later divide into two listed companies and separate the computer and print business by its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
&quot; expected job@@ break@@ down leads to a burden of more than 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , which should lead the unity to separation . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise is becoming smaller and more focused than it HP is today , and we have a broad and abundant portfolio of shops that support business in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing non @-@ reaching , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it is divided into a company that was created in the 19@@ 30s , from gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University , Hewlett @-@ Packard , and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
&quot; HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring , to overcome the ren@@ unci@@ ation of traditional PCs towards mobile devices . &quot;
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest computer manufacturers and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that working together collabor@@ ates a better performance . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al cap@@ tains Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere &quot;
&quot; turn towards Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and provided its rehabilitation according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain . &quot;
the great shame on this issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then back to his old swing back during the season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone which has not been well healed .
this is not a greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in conjunction with his dum@@ pl@@ ings or injuries that he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a medical point of view , but like turning , there is the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of more injury , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also developed an uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd is 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ s in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that they were in six of eight hours since 2007 / 08 , one of the first Premier League clubs that have wast@@ ed most vulner@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the viol@@ ability rate has been ongoing during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a tense period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain nuclear power , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will have a career of the kind that he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins his Champions League &apos;s season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team . &quot;
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia where the Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta starts .
Wen@@ ger can also start with Ki@@ osk Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of post@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to hold the balance and give players that it may need a small dis@@ ruption , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal are clear favor@@ ites , by Group F pers@@ ist , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the players with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also un@@ occupied after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , whereby on the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 2 were measured . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lessons from the past season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation against Monaco and will continue to lead the association to its first European vocation . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it never happened in arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other side I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not a dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy @-@ Show which gives us serious lessons for men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more dist@@ res@@ sing than ever has become , as self @-@ mor@@ nings among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important point of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , announced the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ch ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 than the year of the man , with the goal to ask the culture to seek help when they need it . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the battle in order to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 High School Students with depress@@ ants symptoms presented that if the suff@@ erer had a enough high percentage of friends with a healthy mood . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends are the risks of mental issues . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of more than social media communications , with their focus on style on substance , the in@@ medi@@ oc@@ ability of the response is often more important than a significant contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to be strong , viable and successful to appear , even if in reality domin@@ ates isolation . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by which psych@@ ologists extr@@ insi@@ c values , money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more profound . &quot;
&quot; and as a vide@@ ot@@ ame @-@ invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy . &quot;
the beauty at Friends was that this foc@@ us@@ sing on the head .
&quot; each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , by interaction as friend . &quot;
&quot; humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers @-@ frequent hu@@ gs , moments of soccer games in cozy sh@@ ackl@@ es and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to it , even if they often with@@ hold their feelings to explore . &quot;
&quot; as a member of the phone care I explained : ... &quot; &quot; my audience &apos;s role for people who are de@@ pressed and self @-@ prop@@ elled , showed me really clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often unable to speak to friends .
&quot; I reck@@ on the old speech &quot; I compens@@ ate with it &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you talk about problems . &quot;
&quot; Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind , if I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ic training mechanisms . &quot;
it presents quite clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone to the person &apos;s ey@@ esi@@ ght , the desp@@ air also may help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
and so if you &apos;re visiting Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest featuring the celebration of the day entirely new craf@@ ted scenery why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
&quot; or , even better , if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone sit around , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to mal@@ ign@@ s mal@@ m@@ ess
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Fran@@ son Cav@@ ani after his hit against mal@@ m@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to attract on Malmö .
here are the games report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Fran@@ son Cav@@ ani held course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against mal@@ m@@ n in the Prince &apos;s park@@ on on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria arrived less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League &apos;s debut as PS@@ G players who brought the French master onto the road , but after that they missed out a number of occasions before they finally recorded their head , than Cav@@ ani recorded a ball@@ ad in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A needs a strong start against the Swedish Master , as they not only seek the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was not a classroom of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ ni I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s missed opportunities in front of the gate . he later changed in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with which he began his illustr@@ ator career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to cause 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and to relax relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to finish in the course of season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it , that we did not have scored one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury to the Paris team , which was holding a 2 : 2 oun@@ ce on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was engra@@ ved by Di Maria at the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; Argent@@ in@@ ean wing@@ ed was designated as the man who took the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , and he clari@@ fied , why , when he went in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defence , before he ended in Johan Wil@@ and by beautiful in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if any one believed that PS@@ G would win a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off suggested to achieve this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ alism on the field and was marked with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle ground boo@@ sts a severe opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a f@@ uss of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who pass far along Kevin Tr@@ apps pole in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself was sometimes standing on , with some mis@@ ses and poor connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not least in the first half of the place , after Cav@@ ani had appointed him after the restart . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which turned to Di Mary into a shooting , which was passing by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole . &quot;
&quot; the second gate fell short after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay , and thus achieved his sixth end of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left side of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malmö can come back into the game , and only an excellent entry form of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , was able to keep the end result , before calling Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ im , announced later that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said , &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , who did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hut from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 Change to FC Bayern
world and Europ@@ am@@ eister X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015
&quot; FC Bayern was obviously just before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played back then for FC Barcelona several years ago . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish master , three times Po@@ ck@@ out champion , four times Champions League tournament , two times championship champion , two times Europ@@ am@@ master , a time global master - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , now 35 @-@ year @-@ old , after 24 years , FC Barcelona had left the FC Barcelona and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca betra@@ ys X@@ avi , now he was already standing in front of the Euro 2008 prior to the departure from Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; they told me , that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid was at that time everything , we don &apos;t tell . &quot;
and the registered as well as FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; there was a special offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge , wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; to remember : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi is not switched
but the change did not come about .
and the be@@ zz@@ led man for this is today works for the German record champion : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi , why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has received Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great watch . &quot;
P@@ EP was told me that I wouldn &apos;t change the crew without me .
&quot; this , he has been vict@@ orious . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ er@@ &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi were running .
&quot; X@@ avi was for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League for the total distance on the lawn , the reds of the Red Sea ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the end of the King &apos;s triumph . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays variety within the film
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ du@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ American fil@@ mm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she will not need the scenes behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , as this emphas@@ ised the necessity of alternative perspectives , and in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists elected in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about variety , then you do it during the occupation of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot;
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked with in@@ ei@@ ved un@@ belief and called &quot; wa@@ hoo ! Wow . okay . &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian himself enth@@ used .
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown made the presence of its own Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck , and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers in order to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the nature of Harmony , &quot; said Brown first . &quot;
the only black person and she is a n@@ ut@@ te which is be@@ aten by their white sugar .
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on er@@ res@@ ists that their director could give us something , which we could not want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion has been broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media has explo@@ ded with dis@@ approval about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter @-@ users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that is SO KNOW that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its publication . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments comes at a time , on the exact racial representation in the media at the top of the social discussion . &quot;
&quot; after the Teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white c@@ ops , the movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s hei@@ ghted effect and leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure authorities and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against fern@@ s interven@@ ing . &quot;
in February the voc@@ alist Prince made a landing on the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ ini@@ zed albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums still matter , ( albums are still their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black lives , albums are still their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter will be publishing an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , if the group was regarded as an hate group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently she was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ile , which will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; whether it has accepted the invitation or made the Pope already , is unclear . &quot;
&apos; American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; kr@@ ön@@ t First Champion
&quot; professional sports clim@@ bers and operating instructions Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero , was the first Ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; the contest show , which was just closed her 7th season , had never experienced an competition participant who finished all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the seasons , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ ero@@ y Ge@@ off B@@ ritten until the final . &quot;
the last task assigned to the climbing course on a 75 feet long climbing side@@ walk in 30 seconds .
&quot; passed the task within the time when he was the first Ath@@ l@@ ete , who completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made it to the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after tough victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or his life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot;
so very suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the senior producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter , to discuss the Final and why B@@ ritten had ended up at all the course , not any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it is the one who gets the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and life is changing , he receives the awesome Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe it is swe@@ pt over by it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
&quot; masses of distin@@ ctions , he received from fans . &quot;
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone , then I am glad it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think it was just as felt as they had changed the roles .
&quot; America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for a eighth season , which shooting started in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak away at Minn@@ es@@ ota wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball than today the Tig@@ ers at last place stand in the American League Central .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , however , played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota wins with 5 @-@ 4 on target Field . &quot;
the tw@@ ins disp@@ ens@@ ed a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League su@@ card square .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to produce about a big part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Per@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fredo Simon gave his early offensive assistance erect as a Detroit three times in the first two cour@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth round . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and made three R@@ uns .
it was only his third @-@ winning start in his final nine game .
&quot; I want to end this year strong , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw at the bull@@ se@@ ye every game , and therefore I will have to go into the game completely . &quot;
&quot; the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ ated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since the middle of August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since then he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has got the head@@ wood well , &quot; said Sp@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( bunch of training ) , saw distinc@@ tly better from the bull@@ bar , and he carried it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three cr@@ uns in the back at the end of the seventh cour@@ ings , the tre@@ wins had their best chance to get back into play . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double in the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a cup , and Simon brought his second bass eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy was a wall , the only man , with whom he was confronted with whom he was confronted with the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ cal ro@@ ok@@ ie ro@@ man Miguel S@@ ano , who has left a two @-@ run sn@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run for the second brought the third b@@ uns Tre@@ vor to a Double Play .
&quot; it was the major league played 27 times in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ps suggested a Double Play . &quot;
&quot; after Detroit joined a Insurance @-@ Run on the end of the ninth cour@@ ing , a R@@ BI double stand against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed , however , S@@ ano on three pitch for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit benef@@ itted for the opening of the game by a still not movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers obtained three R@@ uns in the first two cour@@ ings against the leg@@ th@@ and veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game of the viol@@ ability list , after having been missing for a back more than a month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for it , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I lay and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; having received Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ bat@@ ter , Hus@@ ky gave a second to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought by Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z launched by a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series to track with the Run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third that the threat was closed . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers submitted to the second one @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not look very well , but he got the right job . &quot;
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count he did not scored points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ever leg@@ th@@ and A.@@ J.@@ Ah@@ ter .
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four k@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez schied because of a violation of the worm .
he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws which has sacrific@@ ed the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the viol@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ bur@@ ner , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris from the vulner@@ ability list is rep@@ ain@@ ted against the tw@@ ins . &quot;

hundreds of refugees should come in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; most people should then be accomod@@ ated in Wiesbaden in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden at the evening . &quot;
it investigated 450 to 750 in the coming refugees .
several Spor@@ th@@ es of the h@@ ess@@ ische Landes@@ bank have been prepared for this case in the last few days .
&quot; up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily under@@ gone there . &quot;
they are then to be distributed on other municipalities .
&quot; over the past ten days , according to details of the local government at the G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people were in H@@ esse . &quot;
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency services for the great number of refugees in Spor@@ th@@ es .
Ischgl : German military intervention in Syria
&quot; the head of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ g , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not be held without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective &quot; in front of them .
four years ago we were glad that the Kel@@ ch has given a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict is cr@@ ashes in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German amb@@ assador found in Washington also called for a massive listing of international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
&quot; to Germany , Austria has again introduced border controls in its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Interior of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on the evening evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , after Hungary even now no one was returned . &quot;
Germany also returned no refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; in order to ask for an agreement on which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there is already legal talks between the Direc@@ torate @-@ General for Public Safety and representatives from Germany . &quot;
concrete figures were not called them and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees were moved to Austria via the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your goal is usually Germany .
ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit with several other EU heads of state and government a special summit for next week .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states has so far not been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new resume on the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday ( September 22nd ) .
&quot; in view of the strong refugee quot@@ a in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal states with the initial intake and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation , in collaboration with the countries , Merkel announced on the late evening after nearly four months with the Prime Minister in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who are protection br@@ aces , conf@@ esses this too . &quot;
but who does not have a lead @-@ point of view could not remain in Germany .
this idea was in@@ timi@@ dating in the round .
&quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed , the state as a whole must now face a &quot; huge force &quot; force . &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees are now stuck on the Baltic route .
&quot; at night , Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced the border to Romania , also the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary plans to prevent the tu@@ g se@@ es@@ capable over Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new Grenz@@ z@@ au@@ n . &quot;
the Romanian government ple@@ aded the Plan promptly .
there was first arrest of men who had tri@@ pled down the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , eye @-@ witnesses took no more than thousands of migrants to the Greek border . &quot;

&quot; this is the researchers from observations of the &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; . &quot; &quot;
so the moon is easy to track on his path around the ring plan@@ ters .
&quot; though this pi@@ vot@@ al movement is only small , but nevertheless too big for a permanent state of Heaven , it is at a Communication at the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers make their analysis in the journal I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
even longer it was known that there has to be under the cover of En@@ cel@@ adu@@ s liquid water .
&quot; so &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; had already discovered in 2006 ic@@ ul@@ ism on the south @-@ pole of Satur@@ n@@ mon@@ ds , the water v@@ ap@@ or and ice @-@ particles , and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
at least at the south pole there would be an underground sea to the astronom@@ ers at that time .
the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear .

when you buy Mang@@ os not too soft or too firm and smell .

they should be consumed at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then you taste of course pure or in sweet food .

&quot; in the coming night , through the valleys of the night@@ stands , the down@@ side breaks through , as Mete@@ o@@ Schweiz , on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and at night on Thursday , the F@@ öh@@ n was partially surrounded by the folding valleys . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , we crossed a marked K@@ alt@@ front , which brings vigor@@ ous rain @-@ ra@@ inf@@ alls , wind ar@@ ches and a temperature back . &quot;
&quot; as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area over the British islands in a vigor@@ ous south @-@ western flow . &quot;
&quot; on the night@@ stands side , the night breaks down to the valley of the valley . &quot;
&quot; in the episode , the F@@ öh@@ n until Thursday morning in the cas@@ ing valley with bu@@ sters of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the urine , partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can penet@@ rate down to the adjacent activity , and in the mountains there are even organs either by over 120 km / h possible . &quot;
&quot; during the north on Wednesday rus@@ hing hair dryer for som@@ mer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts at the end of a slope . &quot;
&quot; here , it uses rain , which lasts until Thursday nights . &quot;
&quot; in total , south of the Alps must be considered in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 lit@@ res of rain per square meter , but after the last few days they have already enjoyed large rain amounts . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the F@@ öh@@ n is approaching the air , in the episode opens a cold front with powerful , partly swe@@ ating rain from west to East across Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind gets heavily up to the stor@@ my and the temperatures clearly go back . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it becomes a sunny day and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther @-@ Square
&quot; just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther square . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of the former President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , the name of the German former Yugoslavia had so far been chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday by the Opp@@ io Hill . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the working community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; J@@ ens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants could live in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority often only in hiding their faith . &quot;
&quot; with the square in symbolic way , it is visible that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the beginning of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a commented sinn@@ ers .
his negative impressions are likely to be encouraged by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Lu@@ ther had then initi@@ ate the split of the ab@@ end@@ onian church with his th@@ eses .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main units that Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with phantas@@ tic pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who had formulated his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative shapes got the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equal to &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , according to the respective topics , that can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar alt is working on his Bible , for which he met a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of &quot; &quot; Book of all books &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerged are cycles , which devote themselves to themes like cru@@ ises , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; so , he has spont@@ aneously fascinated several partners : the same goes for the Lu@@ ther publisher with its the@@ ological outlook as well as for the Kettler publisher with his emphasis on art books . &quot;
and that is above all the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost based on the basis of painting with the particular bi@@ ographi@@ es .
&quot; he interpreted the Bible chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible , and so into Today , into current associations . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of painting .
&quot; nestled between the Original Bi@@ bel@@ z@@ itat of Martin Lu@@ ther , and in each case a proposition of the artist , who had formulated his very personal thought of the particular situation here . &quot;
the jewelry @-@ band has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old now allows a profound insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately born at all S@@ avi@@ our for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that hal@@ ted to the strict Protest@@ ant rulers . &quot;
&quot; and the up@@ bringing already came along with the tube , &quot; &quot; Oth@@ mar Old . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work to re@@ vise this , in order to be able to re @-@ carry me again with the Lord Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to put art in fast @-@ pac@@ ed time , again , &quot; &quot; the perception of sculpture is today justified by advertising and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is not given .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .

&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the spect@@ ator go into the images &quot; &quot; Come , &quot; &quot; they have to operate , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture looks for his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost inv@@ ading on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Foundation , &quot; I always like &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how to understand life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to understand the Bible completely , but for him that important , mysterious themes are selected . &quot;
&quot; this was no collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; it is about the images , the text explained only . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Lu@@ ther Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler &apos;s language both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .

DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B holds its commitment to refugees up to 2019 in the German Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
the football will react to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy to cope with the previous problems .
&quot; I think this is the greatest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can be no one in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter me ; I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in any particular interest to get this topic get a grip on , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
during the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and meeting the Chancellor of B@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z , and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; of course , the subject will certainly play a key role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
of football can help and set up .
but the decisive woman has to take place of politics .
the German Bundes@@ Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative &apos; 1 : 0 for a welcome &apos; to four years .
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some Bundes@@ liga are also supporting this program .
&quot; already at this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ a indicates a clear sign when they are taking place on the left tri@@ kot@@ t instead of the usual demand logos ( Her@@ mes ) the printing &quot; &quot; We will help - # co@@ es@@ welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that all of us should help , where and how they can only &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; le@@ aning Ru@@ di V@@ ö@@ ller read the &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and drew the project as a &quot; self @-@ course . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama works every one , no one must look away . &quot;
&quot; we can Bundes@@ liga team , no , we need to use our radi@@ ance to help our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ unt@@ hei@@ ms manager Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
&quot; to the European qualification race against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes the support for refugees as &quot; &quot; a big joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that all 36 licensing agreements had launched in their own places , is great . &quot;
&quot; just as great , it is just as great that small and smallest ones are being active . &quot;
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is living in football . &quot;
&quot; that is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , the association is presenting itself with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government in each case 300 000 euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the associations will have announced the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; reported ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Vor@@ ar@@ re@@ ef loses an eye in the accident
&quot; the Vor@@ ar@@ er@@ ef of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has led to several reports by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; after the accident at the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA , he had fallen after midnight on a wat@@ ert@@ glas that he held in his left hand reports the &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ar@@ du@@ ous , it was power@@ less , then we slept out on the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ fe &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder of Thal@@ asso . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work afterwards .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the super@@ visory council in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said plat@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully paid . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thurs@@ days ) he will come back to Germany in October and continue to carry out the software group .
&quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I got the whole time in regular contact with the Super@@ visory Board and its chairman H@@ asso Platt@@ forms , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t generally comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; whether it is important to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everybody can happen so something . &quot;
&quot; important is to re@@ stand up , if you really liked . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot non@@ slip unless skir@@ m@@ ish ...

football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : gra@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play the Europa League are final .
the Official winner will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in Du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot refer to him unfortunately , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ urban game against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach will be open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of his pros , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his gene@@ alog@@ y position on the reaction of the reaction . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ way position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking the place of Chief Li@@ ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises on an absolute top level , praised the football @-@ teachers the world champion . &quot;
&quot; however , Fin@@ den@@ f@@ eller arrives in the future in all Europe league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left however open . &quot;
with high probability he will also share the second game .
&quot; the for@@ ay statement of fellow players Re@@ us , that the final withdrawal for the BV@@ B in the Europa League will be the target , holding mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for veri@@ fiable : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : the government wants the leading role in Germany
&quot; Germany should be fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner in technological advances according to the will of the federal government upon the change of the car . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the fair I@@ AA from a &apos; new &apos; New &apos; Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the automated driving and net@@ worked lanes will increase road safety and provide less support , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 countries , which come together with representatives of the industry at the I@@ AA . &quot;
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Federal Ministry of affairs emphasises the importance of mobile broad@@ band building and one @-@ day det@@ ention on digital radio broad@@ casting .
&quot; as a result , the testing of new technology is currently being created on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that the driver does not contain any additional risk of any additional risk , the federal government wants to review the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to stand for an international extent that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ driven cars of 10 to 130 km / hour is raised . &quot;
&quot; the federal government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far been seen as a driver . &quot;
&quot; with automated driving , the car takes over the leadership , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which can capture the environment and process data in a sn@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; after one of the study approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways to 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , driving vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected far from 2020 . &quot;
&quot; value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and high @-@ automated driving functions on site Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 2025 to approximately 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ arrangements S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
but the Germans are still scep@@ tical as their people are scep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA prer@@ og@@ atives of For@@ sa @-@ Institute on behalf of the Test In@@ quiry remains to the result that only eight percent of the German believe that self @-@ self prop@@ elled cars will prevail over the next ten years , but 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents said to 2025 with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ driven vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey by the Bit@@ k@@ om , Bit@@ k@@ om would only agree to dis@@ agree on all roads throughout the entire trip . &quot;
&quot; on the highway that could be present in flowing traffic just 15 percent , at St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
well each Fourth would leave the car to no circumstances under any circumstances .
B@@ oll does team@@ - and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; by October 25 - October 4 , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will only stand up in the single market from 25 September to 4 October . &quot;
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22nd .
&quot; that is a giant loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo over@@ hau@@ l the title , &quot; said Bundes@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ Plan in Düsseldorf . &quot;
B@@ oll was located at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor for Sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the disadvantage , we are now no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; concluded S @-@ Europ@@ am@@ eister Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;

&quot; back then Timo has also been missing , and we have become an EP Master . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an end@@ ant
it is a mix of great modes of fashion and a watch@@ men @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : window man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that can be terri@@ fying human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , which became among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits the big star of the fashion scene - and with it that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say today that I am the end of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was built , meanwhile it is real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the run @-@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th September to the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO Cultural Foundation , it is a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ ker has changed his first thought @-@ standing attitude to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually , be it against that , for : &quot; for me the exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , one gets into the museum . &quot;
previously the impressive collection had already been in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris Station .
&quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful dres@@ ses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s hard @-@ looking job , the fashion history has written , without ever completing a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ological is the show not constructed but it is an excellent chore@@ ographic work , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ aming the doll@@ s , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;
14 tons of material have car@@ ni@@ gh the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October was a special look at : a le@@ ather@@ less out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are worse than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy is seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , ag@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous mo@@ ur@@ ts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student , and bad in football ) he was attracted to his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
the un@@ cast of fashion he then contributed to itself later .
&quot; there are fashion literature , and looked at the dr@@ afts of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
later I bought this one but of course .
for his first own fashion he won &apos;t pay the models .
&quot; they did not get anything , they were allowed to bear the gear . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
it used to be on the long embro@@ ider@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen .
&quot; the extensive materials and tips emerged in large quantity for customers , for example being re@@ written to blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone is not working anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of Mo@@ desp@@ ke Pl@@ auen . &quot;
instead the fashion is again important .
&quot; in the beginning of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then squee@@ zed through the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as being niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , at accessories such as bags and in regional tr@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called Vintage mode , which re@@ jects itself in the past Sti@@ let@@ tes , an increasing order potential . &quot;
&quot; those who are not being served in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer a market at the market . &quot;
&quot; with us , they already have the half of all orders . &quot;
Mo@@ desp@@ ke Pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies a member of the Sec@@ ond@@ ary Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Stick@@ ers .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , roughly 80 percent of its sales have been departed . &quot;
private professionals and also wholesale trade is almost no longer available .
our products are hardly able to reach customers on this path .
the mass ware would be made much cheaper than the Asian region and almost exclusively sold via chains .
&quot; weak@@ ening the export , up to Russia and the USA . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; in fact , the industry linked by environmental awareness continues to score points like Cor@@ du@@ la Bauer by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we lead a seal of quality , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially responsible . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the used materials . &quot;
&quot; as a designer , U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger &apos;s external office of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ al@@ ises in embro@@ ider@@ ies and points . &quot;
&quot; to face competition from the Asian region , we have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories , who must think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly lighter to maintain a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago Kath@@ til@@ designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter rein@@ stall the historical snow point .
&quot; thereby , the machine is embro@@ i@@ dered in a few places small kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ eder in Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ es inspired : &quot; &quot; previously I could not do anything with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ® . &quot;
now she uses the snow @-@ tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in an elaborate processes , they character@@ ize the patterns in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; Re@@ uter says . &quot;
&quot; she also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors used in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and want a souvenir piece . &quot;
this way I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ®

&quot; however , according to &quot; entertainment Weekly &quot; however , it is not about re @-@ fil@@ tering , but to be a kind of continuation that played 20 years after the first film with the magical n@@ anny . &quot;
this is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world crisis in England .

XI pus@@ hes the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy has to open wider outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday a group that was commissioned with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should use to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business creation , &quot; he said in a language at the 16th meeting of the Central leadership group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and drive reforms a new momentum and vitality guide and provide new space for economic growth , Xi . &quot;
&quot; the executive group adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regul@@ ating market access , relaxation of border controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital and re@@ conditioning of the inhabitants of Mel@@ des@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified by investments do not come into question . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because it demonstrates the market a greater role in the ingredient of resources , a constitutional business environment and open the market open , the statement stated . &quot;
&quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on those powers , and make sure companies decide how they will manage their business . &quot;
&quot; the statement also stated that China should allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border cooperation , and to explore new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; as part of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors to open , other areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign enterprises and deliver better services for them , &quot; &quot; the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier to apply for foreigners , a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; to apply by the requirements and the application process will be facilit@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee , exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
at the session also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important guide like Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as was reported in one of the following statement . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury in rob@@ bery @-@ fishing
the European Commission plans to double the threshold values for mer@@ cury in large rob@@ bery and consumers by providing a significantly higher dose of nerve damage .
&quot; consumer organization Food@@ watch , who is a corresponding work@@ paper of the EU , cri@@ tici@@ zed the plans &quot; &quot; excessive &quot; &quot; risks and side @-@ effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full W@@ anted to pregnant and minor children , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt gives the threshold of the nerve po@@ ison@@ er for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ ks or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury , depending on the kil@@ og@@ ram of fish . &quot;
&quot; the large rob@@ bery @-@ fish , however , be so strongly loaded with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the still valid threshold values approximately 50 percent of the cas@@ ks are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the border values , only 14,@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this relaxation , the EU wants to increase the threshold values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kil@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ watch was referred to as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller cemetery @-@ fish , such as carp , are usually so low , that they already keep the planned peak value today . &quot;
&quot; the decrease in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des diver@@ gen@@ esis , which alone helps the economy &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
Mer@@ cury is one for the people of high @-@ toxic heavy metals that will greatly increase through the food chain above all in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; the Federal Government is thus for@@ ew@@ ar@@ ned that &quot; &quot; low amounts especially in inf@@ ants can cause damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the German Ministry of Environment explains its homepage with regard to the existing values , but that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; should not be expected . &quot;
Mer@@ cury is primarily determined by burning in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information of the German Ministry of Defense , the German Bundestag Di@@ ameter at the Bundestag Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total of Germany em@@ it@@ ated total . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in El@@ be , Rhein and Danube is &quot; &quot; permanently and nation@@ wide &quot; , &quot; had c@@ ited the &quot; mirror &quot; in March of the paper . &quot;
last year of Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings in front of mer@@ cury in fish already among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ SF@@ F .
