&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the entry to 1 . January 1979 or at a different time , that was agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the timing necessary for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget . &quot;
C ) Every@@ one Member State may provide payments before the above @-@ mentioned terminals .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organisation , the administrative pul@@ ling takes place on the cash or the school j@@ aw in order to cover the expenditure on the special transaction and to equi@@ p the special account in a reasonable way . &quot;
&quot; in the gran@@ ting of this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
&quot; III ) to the extent , in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ; &quot;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further credit storage capacity to Dar@@ rest conditions without delay ; and
VII ) the circum@@ ference in which the problems of the concerned countries are regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; any special transaction , the financing of a clear and rapidly inv@@ alu@@ able development programme or measures ( including a sec@@ toral process ) , regardless of whether it is approved for the commercial programme of organisation , or not , according to the practices of the organization financed by the organization funded , approved and managed by the letter b ) of the Pre@@ am@@ ble to this Agreement called the Noti@@ fying objective . &quot;
&quot; the means of special payments must not be used instead of ord@@ itable funding of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has already been approved as part of a programme or credit for a programme or project that has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or organisation . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 subject to special response to the same back @-@ payment terms , which apply to the Organisation for development of development in general ; they are discounted in ten years of age at 50 years of age . &quot;
special respon@@ dence can be granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
&quot; amounts to the payment of this prayer , are immediately placed to the organization that ret@@ ains them . &quot;

&quot; the revenue from every special transaction can be used for expenses in the currency of the benefici@@ ary or for goods or services that are manufactured b@@ z@@ w . inherited in developing countries , the members of the organization are determined and which may be defined by the administrator at the time of the loan granted , recei@@ vers of a special response to date . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ lic@@ ations from special response to the individual transaction , and in this way the amount paid back in the currency of a member state is returned to his input as soon as possible from the administrator to the concerned member state . &quot;
the administrator has taught until the complete completion of all special response to the EEC relating to the exam by the directors in preparation and by the directors approved by the directors .
&quot; during the period of rede@@ mption of the special transaction , the administrator has taught the EEC quarter annual report on the development of the special transaction and the prior spending . &quot;
the administrative committee submitted to the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the business year of the organization a detailed evaluation of the non @-@ respon@@ sive b@@ illing of the organization to this account .
&quot; after the special payment of the EEC , the administrator is communicated to the EEC as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programmes provided by the Special transaction . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and carries suitable records and b@@ illing , from which the contributions to the special account , resulting from the account received and paid out of the account paid , and the withdraw@@ als made by the Member States are obvious . &quot;
the EEC and the administrator work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until the complete edition of the special ac@@ tion@@ ality of time to time , have funded programmes or plans and about all other questions related to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;

&quot; the agreements could be paid up to the total amount of credit@@ or land on the mechanism , namely within a total limits of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion b@@ illing units ; this is equivalent to 50 % of all future willingness to member countries . &quot;
&quot; but now , some conditions are mentioned below , for their application the BI@@ Z would be ready . &quot;
&quot; at any stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , whereby the possibility of extensions have to be exceeded without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as its et@@ wa@@ its extension , the BI@@ Z would charge a cre@@ d@@ iter@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I agreed that the first Zion@@ ists should not be termin@@ ated before the termination of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments of their own liqui@@ dity . &quot;

in the form of a brief@@ ing between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on trade with Ham@@ mel - and L@@ amm@@ ates
I remember the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish regulations on the import of Ham@@ mel - the lam@@ b and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community related to the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . in the course of these negotiations the two parties are as follows :
- fresh or frozen Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ;
&quot; in the context of this agreement , the export opportunities for Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat meat from Argentina following the community is set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle @-@ weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a fl@@ aw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the fact that the annual amount did not exce@@ eds the agreed quantity and executed according to the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade , please consult the two parties of this agreement to each other prior to the implementation of such a change in the number 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community is entitled to claim the guard , they are obliged to bear , to do so , that in this agreement , access Argentina &apos;s access to the common market is not touched . &quot;

&quot; the total amount number 2 @-@ the total quantity will be fixed by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community on 23 000 tons of battle @-@ weight . &quot;
the community takes everything to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing Argent@@ in@@ ean Ham@@ mel - and lam@@ b industri@@ alized on the Common Market in the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the community takes preced@@ ence , thus the sales volumes of interven@@ tionist meat due to the implementation of the regulation of Argent@@ ine Ham@@ mel - and lam@@ b is not under@@ min@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; considering the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the Community agree that any actual use of refund or other funding measures for the export of Ham@@ mel and L@@ amm@@ ers are only at prices and conditions that stand in accordance with existing international obligations and consider the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are present in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of General customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina provides compliance with this agreement , in particular by that it has been granted in this agreement with the quantities of ex@@ porting licenses for the products stated in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the community is obliged to meet all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of entries for the above @-@ mentioned products is based in Argentina from the submission of a fu@@ hr@@ licence agreement , which is given the place issued by the Argent@@ in@@ ean government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system will be determined so that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of cons@@ ular products can be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in addition , the competent authorities of the responsible authority of the local community in regular intervals have been issued ; these data may be en@@ umer@@ ated according to identification land . &quot;
the committee does not carry out that the agreement is properly applied and smoothly worked .
&quot; he regularly examine the tendency on the Ham@@ mel , lam@@ b and goat &apos;s heart of both parties and the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets including the conditions that are of importance to number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee does not carry out that the proper use of this agreement will not be affected by it , that products from Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b - and goat @-@ meat under the agreement will not be executed according to the community . &quot;
the committee discuss all issues relating to this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the relevant authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall be governed by the rights and obligations of the parties within the G@@ AT@@ T .
number 2 fixed annual amount is valid for the period from 1 . January to 31 .
the amount of trade agreement reached by the entry into force of the year until 1 . January of the following year will be determined in the ratio of the total annual amount of year and carries the seasonal character of the trade .

&quot; the committee constantly checks the tendency on the Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b - and goat &apos;s heart of the two contract parties and the market conditions , including the terms of sales conditions , including the conditions that are of importance to clause 7 . &quot;
