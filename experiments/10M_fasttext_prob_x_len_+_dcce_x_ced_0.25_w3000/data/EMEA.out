this document is a summary of the European Public Relations Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) has been judged to discuss recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the packages ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg blades ( tablets that solve in the mouth ) , as a solution to one ( 1 mg / ml ) and an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or sight of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and ins@@ anity ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , an psychological disorder , where the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate @-@ severe severe episodes , and to the prevention of man@@ ic episodes of patients who are addressed in the past in the drug . &quot;
injection solution is applied for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral in@@ ges@@ tion of the medication is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution to one or the mel@@ ting of tablets can be applied in patients using the sli@@ pping of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines , which are just like A@@ bili@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that facilitate the communication of nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably appears above all as a &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also ser@@ otonin called ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in low degree as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters appears to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine can play a role in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and its re@@ occur . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms was investigated in three studies of up to one year .
the efficiency of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or similar disorders that compared to increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was tested over twelve weeks on 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that compared to increased un@@ rest ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients were examined by a standard sc@@ ala in bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also led studies to examine , as the body takes the mel@@ ting of mel@@ ting chains and the solution to take res@@ or@@ bit . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with injection solution , patients showed A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5@@ mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significant reduction of the symptoms increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
when applying the bi@@ polar disorder decreased in four of five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy therefore , up to 74 weeks , more effective than plac@@ ebo the repeti@@ tions of the recur@@ ring episodes in previously treated patients and when it was in addition to an existing treatment administ@@ ered . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms increased their un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to capture ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , extrac@@ ting ( un@@ controll@@ able ) , ac@@ credit@@ ation ( in@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , sali@@ va ( increased sali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ veterinary medicines ( CH@@ MP ) ended that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia , as well as in preventing a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes were talking to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a or@@ ale therapy is not suitable to weigh against the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission published Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a licence for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is for treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients which had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the recommended initial dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
increased effectiveness of dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended initial dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients &gt; 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient population , a lower Initi@@ al dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Indu@@ ector is set out of the combination therapy should the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dosage should be reduced to recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing a anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no shelter in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ac disease , coron@@ ary heart disease , coron@@ ary heart disease , hypo@@ cr@@ acy , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ pressure medicines or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which performed a year or less , there were occasional reports on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l emerging dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if with an AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , patients may occur signs and symptoms of a sp@@ at@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient developed and symptoms that arises on a m@@ ns , or imp@@ lied high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ otic medicines must be removed , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied in patients with var@@ ic@@ fan@@ ony in the An@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states that are used with var@@ ic@@ ular cases . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated with patients with psych@@ osis who were treated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , an increased mortality in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were however in one of these studies , a study involving dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the contact for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ebox or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessment for Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related events related to AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents of patients to permit direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of a deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally seen in schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie , the application of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , where weight gain is known as side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary impact of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with themselves over@@ flowing side effects such as Se@@ coding ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a mag@@ us@@ sic acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ming rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is considered to be clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy pro@@ b@@ ances a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) was the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other high @-@ effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as fluid et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have and therefore should be made similar tin reductions . &quot;
&quot; at CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos;@@ bad &quot; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans , the common application can result with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher Plas@@ tics centr@@ ations compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ ering . &quot;
if one draws the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y should consider the potential benefits for the patient &apos;s potential risks .
&quot; other high @-@ effective In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ants , have likely to have similar effects and therefore should be made similar tin reductions . &quot;
&quot; according to the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y should be raised at the dos@@ er at the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 will be administ@@ ered together with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y together with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y can be calculated with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day no significant effect on the met@@ abol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ Rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ ing ) . &quot;
patients should get out to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; because of the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the concerns of the animal studies , this medicine must not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk of the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , even with other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines the patients should be war@@ ned to use dangerous machines , including strength vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 ) on than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks joined patients , which were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , a total of reduced incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) from EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared with patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.4 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients which were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , and 15,@@ 1 % in patients under ov@@ op@@ zap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under the Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium treatment .
during the long@@ time period of over 26 weeks at a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 7.2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where there are potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( Cre@@ atin @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients compared to 2.8 % of patients with plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ l@@ ep@@ tic syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and Kr@@ amp@@ fan@@ atics , unwanted events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials and since the launch of an acci@@ dental or inten@@ tional acute survival with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without any death succession .
&quot; although there is no information on the effectiveness of a her@@ edit@@ ary with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l before ; it is unlikely , however , that hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits is because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plas@@ ma connection . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is introduced with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder over the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vit@@ ro a high affin@@ ity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ or as well as an excessive affin@@ ity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , as ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 ep@@ ine and to the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ recipe . &quot;
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in d@@ osing of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy pro@@ hibition showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction in the relationship of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a d@@ 2 / D@@ 3 recept@@ or Lig@@ uria , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on Put@@ amen . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to plac@@ ebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in an Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study was in week 52 the proportion of the Res@@ p@@ onder patients , which in both groups are similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of Mess@@ enger , which were defined as secondary tuition , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ant scale , showed a significant improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo study about 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia showed itself significantly higher reduction of the dropped rate at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % among plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in an o@@ lan@@ zap@@ all@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study on schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ zo@@ l ( N = 18 or 13 % of the value @-@ value patients ) , performed under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( N = 18 or 13 % of the value @-@ value patients ) ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l a compared to plac@@ ebo over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study on 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to plac@@ ebo not excessive efficacy .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies on 12 weeks in patients with an academic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a opposite plac@@ ebo over week 3 and a lasting effect , which was comparable to that of li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , week 12 . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also pointed out a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ia , such as li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with an academic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features that partly over 2 weeks not on Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ monopol@@ l had a superior effectiveness in reducing Man@@ kind symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with li@@ thium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time expansion phase over 74 weeks , with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before Rand@@ om@@ isation had reached a re@@ is@@ sion in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back , mostly in preventing a back in the man@@ ia . &quot;
based on in vit@@ ro @-@ studies the enzy@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is responsible for the de@@ duc@@ ation and hydr@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l which is cat@@ aly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary @-@ time lies with approxim@@ ating 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans about CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approxim@@ ate 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans about CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ opo@@ lies between male and female healthy prosperity , as well as a pharmac@@ opo@@ etic investigation of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ ined patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a single @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics revealed no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on pharmac@@ opo@@ lies by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure .
&quot; a single dose of study with a different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect with the liver enzy@@ mes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study embr@@ aced only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabo@@ lic capacity . &quot;

&quot; Tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed when dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects of fibre @-@ based adren@@ al glands ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ yma cell loss ) in rats with 20 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10@@ mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the average Ste@@ ady State @-@ Ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum Ste@@ ady State @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended max@@ im State @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended max@@ im State exposure ( AU@@ C ) .
in addition a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been found as a result of the ex@@ tradition of sul@@ ph@@ ate in@@ ju@@ g@@ ments of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeti@@ tive capacity of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1@@ - up to 3@@ times of the average Ste@@ ady State @-@ Ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended max@@ im State exposure ( AU@@ C to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose of man based on mg / m2 ) .

&quot; the Committee for Human@@ veterinary medicines ( CH@@ MP ) presented that Abra@@ x@@ ane is inadequate in patient , in which the first treatment was no longer considered , more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el treatments which must not be given to any other drugs , to reduce side effects . &quot;
January 2008 the European Commission sent to the enterprise Abra@@ ham@@ cience bio cience is a licence for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indic@@ ted for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ zin@@ om in patients where the initial treatment for metastatic disease is failed and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine treatment is not displayed ( see also section 4.4 ) .

Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ uli actu@@ ator that promotes the contrac@@ tion of the micro @-@ indi@@ gn@@ ation and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by Hem@@ ation of their deport@@ ation .
this stabil@@ isation leads to a im@@ itation of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ t@@ osis has been convey@@ ed into the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of Plas@@ tic@@ om@@ pon@@ ement in the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ pers and in the frame of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells .

the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ zin@@ om is supported by data from 106 patients in two in@@ ar@@ mo@@ gen in@@ blin@@ ded studies and from 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma . &quot;
this multi@@ cent@@ ric study was carried out in patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma which received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with pre@@ di@@ ment of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ hour inf@@ usion without a medi@@ ator ( N = 229 ) .
&quot; in recording in the study , 64 % of the patients had a significant general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al met@@ ast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received any chemotherapy before , 27 % had only a adjuv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of Met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to Met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and to the adjuv@@ ant treatment . &quot;

the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ G@@ abe ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ based Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection and also the distribution volume was with Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies of human micro@@ micro@@ some and tissue cell is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily attributed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) metabo@@ li@@ zed .

Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as injection in a V@@ ene in the frame of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients which caused by kidney problems caused by kidney disease .
&quot; all patients participating in this study was issued at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , before they were either in@@ amed to se@@ amed , or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness of the efficiency was the change of hem@@ ost@@ al values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company also laid out the results of a study in which the effects of fl@@ amed se@@ amed amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined in 114 cancer patients who got chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ ost@@ al values of patients , which were converted to se@@ amed amed , in the same extent as for those patients who continue to received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the patients , which were still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , the occasionally to symptom of an En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
se@@ amed should not be applied in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
se@@ amed as inj@@ ecting under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this is triggered by no allergic reactions .
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ veterinary medicines ( CH@@ MP ) agreed to conclude that the drug has been produced according to the provisions of the European Union of proof that the drug has been a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that is attri@@ but@@ able to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ine when the Hä@@ mo@@ aning deficiency symptoms and the avoidance of blood trans@@ forms required concentration is increased .
the Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ an@@ rose should amount to about 1 g / dl ( E@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in blood pressure .

the decision for application re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment by the participation of each patient which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients who are intended for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , prior to the epoch of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy the cause of the an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
patients who under@@ go to a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure should obtain an adequate thy@@ os@@ e@@ o@@ prophy@@ la@@ xis as they have an increased risk for thro@@ m@@ bot@@ any and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly with an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treating epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting point of charge of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post@@ operative thro@@ pods / vas@@ cular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven that they can survive in tumor patient with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or decrease the risk of tum@@ ours . &quot;

&quot; when epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied together with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in should be checked and the Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ ters to be adapted to the rising hem@@ at@@ rit . &quot;
from in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ investigations on tumor tissues there are no evidence of an inter@@ interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .

the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ ening increase of blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence thro@@ po@@ vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .

survival and tum@@ ors were examined in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were dou@@ blin@@ ded plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in the overall survival between the patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients and the control of patients .
&quot; in these studies , people treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients with an an@@ emia due to various frequent mal@@ ign@@ ome con@@ sist@@ ent , statisti@@ cally significant mortality than with controls . &quot;
the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thy@@ ro@@ osen and related complications at re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic an@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients and with controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk for thro@@ po@@ ise bol@@ ts in tumor patient , which will be treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic corruption , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are handled on the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic v@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tumor patient that can be transferred with chemotherapy than 13 g / dl , since few patients were included with these characteristics in the insp@@ ected data . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated previous application showed a half @-@ value period of approximately 4 hours in healthy pro@@ b@@ ings , and a slightly extended half @-@ value of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency . &quot;
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um mirror of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um mirror , which can be achieved after intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections . &quot;

&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta is applied to the treatment of the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( an ail@@ ment , which makes bone spray ) both in women after men@@ opause and men . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone arri@@ es ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a little traum@@ atic hip , • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip replacement should be a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta , which can reduce in the three days following inf@@ usion symptoms such as fever , gri@@ p@@ pe@@ similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in treating the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta must only be prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating this condition . &quot;
&quot; as the ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta weed is like in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to the rating of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and it has been studied the number of sp@@ inal and gir@@ dles over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study embr@@ aced by 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a gir@@ dles ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies at a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at ) . &quot;
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the content of the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ase in Ser@@ um ( a enzy@@ me that lo@@ wered bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the output .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of sp@@ inal veins has been reduced in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) over a period of three years compared to patients under plac@@ ebo over 70 % . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) , with those among plac@@ ebo , the risk of gir@@ frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta emerge within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in repeated inf@@ usions .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta must not be applied in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients with A@@ cl@@ asta are subject to risk of kidney , reactions to the inf@@ usion place and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta puts an image material for physicians who use A@@ cl@@ asta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which explains how the drug is to use , as well as similar material for patients , in which the effects of the medication is explained and pointed out when to turn to the doctor . &quot;

the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended for intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta once annually .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , the administration of inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hips ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should A@@ cl@@ asta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the mor@@ bus .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta was observed a long re@@ mission period in patients who addressed to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure that patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent being low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , an initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis is recommended from 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , i.e. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms resulting within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
patients with kidney dys@@ functions ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a credit @-@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended in A@@ cl@@ asta as limited clinical experience for this patient group .
&quot; aging patients ( &gt; 65 years ) One dosage adjustment is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and eli@@ mination in older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and young people A@@ cl@@ asta will not be recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years , as data on im@@ memorial and effectiveness are missing . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as for this patient population is limited @-@ limited clinical experience .
an existing Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ an@@ emia is prior to treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta by sufficient attri@@ but@@ ing of calcium and vitamin D to treat ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; because of the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone mineral can develop a temporary , with@@ under symptom@@ atic hypo@@ cr@@ ates , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ons ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure that patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be assessed before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ ates with appropriate correc@@ tive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental gri@@ ps , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opathy in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tics . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the treating doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms resulting within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of cases of severe inci@@ dents were reported in patients , the A@@ cl@@ asta received , increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients that were plac@@ ebo ( 0,@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ ve Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the total prevalence of alleg@@ ations between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.@@ 6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2,@@ 1 % ) . &quot;

kidney dys@@ functions Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid has been associated with kidney dys@@ functions ( i.e. an increase in Ser@@ um @-@ Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases regarded as acute kidney failure .
the change in Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( annually before administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were in a clinical study with oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in Ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed by 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the Labor@@ ers @-@ findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which treated below normal variations ( less than fe@@ ather m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical trial treated patients compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the patients treated patients . &quot;
&quot; all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures after an hip re@@ ac@@ upuncture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures after a recent exp@@ iry , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received a initi@@ al@@ dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to inf@@ usion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;

clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once each year were shown at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women at the age between 65 and 89 years ) with either a disease vaccine or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as &lt; -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing ver@@ teb@@ rates .
effects on morph@@ ometric ver@@ teb@@ rates A@@ cl@@ asta lo@@ wered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new ver@@ teb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older were compared to 60 % decreased risk of ver@@ teb@@ rates as compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 0001 ) .
&quot; effects on frac@@ tures of A@@ cl@@ asta pointed out a consistently remaining effect over three years , which resulted in a um 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for gir@@ dles . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased the bone density on the steering wir@@ es , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared to the plac@@ ebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increase the bone density of the steering bu@@ ck@@ ness around 6.7 % , the whole hips at 6,0 % , the thig@@ h at 5.5 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology with 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , which were treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies were taken out of the pel@@ vic mud . &quot;
a micro@@ computer @-@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in comparison with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients compared to plac@@ ebo an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary bone of bone architecture .

&quot; the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 ) , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the inf@@ usion . &quot;
the overall mort@@ ality stood at 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group with A@@ cl@@ asta treated group , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D on the overall light and thig@@ h at all points .
the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment conducted more than 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to an increase of BM@@ D by 5.5 % at the total amount and by 4.3 % at the thig@@ h .
clinical effectiveness in men in the HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were reported 5@@ 08 men random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged by 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to once weekly hub of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at referred to in 24 months compared to the starting value . &quot;
&quot; clinical effectiveness of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et des Kno@@ wing A@@ cl@@ asta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ological confirmed , especially fri@@ vol@@ ous he@@ um mirror of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase , according to the ( medium @-@ average phosph@@ ate @-@ specific top normal at admission to the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months has been proven in two six@@ teen @-@ month studies .
&quot; in the combined results , after 6 months a similar de@@ preci@@ ation of pain , and pain @-@ controlled compared to the output value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at observed . &quot;
patients who were classified as Res@@ p@@ onder at the end of the sixth month ( responding to the therapy ) could be included in an observ@@ atory phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , patients were able to participate in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic appeal was reported in 141 of with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared with 71 of the average @-@ observ@@ atory phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multi @-@ times 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid at 64 patients the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which turned out to be dos@@ is@@ independently . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the plas@@ mas@@ ystem quickly took up on &lt; 10 % of the maximum @-@ value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting period very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; low bi@@ ph@@ as@@ cop@@ ic dis@@ appearance from the large circulation of half @-@ times t ½ α occur and t a ½ lesson , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary phase with a tempor@@ al elimination of ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early se@@ aling phases ( α and β with the above ½ -@@ values ) will probably present the rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bone and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administ@@ ered dosage in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body Clear@@ ance is independent from the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ s@@ äu@@ er concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plas@@ tic@@ on@@ cent@@ ation against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systems metabo@@ lic substances is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metabo@@ li@@ zed by humans , and because it is a guar@@ ded or no more direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , fuel @-@ dependent in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;

it gives you that an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney dys@@ functions up to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid requires .
because for heavy kidney dys@@ functions ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data can be limited for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest not let@@ al effective single dose was given to mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in trials in dogs , single @-@ p@@ ants of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administ@@ ered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influ@@ encing . &quot;

&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta affects the bone structure again norm@@ alized , thereby forming a normal bone @-@ formation and thus gives the bone strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or you need to under@@ wear a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; using A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff when you have other medicines or have recently taken / applied / applied , even though it is not prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , of which they are aware of the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when applying A@@ cl@@ asta along with foods and drinks , you are worried that you can use in accordance with the instructions of your doctor , and after the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administ@@ ered by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ene .

&quot; the summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ur@@ inary Fig@@ ure ( EP@@ AR ) , in which the studies conducted by the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes ( also known as non @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular excessive patients ) in which Met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ medicine ) is not shown along with another Di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular , overweight patients ) which can not be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest compatibility dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or insul@@ in , the previous dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ut@@ s or insul@@ in can be kept at the beginning of the ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( lower blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ut@@ s or insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s physical insul@@ in can be improved in better , and the blood sugar level is decre@@ asing that type @-@ 2 diabetes is better set . &quot;
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acet@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy has been studied ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either accounts or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of a substance in the blood has been measured in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which shows how good the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; accounts led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which means that the blood sugar values used by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg reduced . &quot;
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study showed the effect of the additional gift of ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff in a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by reducing % while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 100 % .
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and insul@@ in in 28@@ 9 patients was examined , the patients , the ac@@ tos in addition to insul@@ in , compared with 0.7 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in the patient , which were additionally plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the common side effects associated with ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( decre@@ asing ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ es@@ th@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to maturity ) . &quot;
&quot; accounts may not be applied to patients suffering from pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or di@@ ab@@ etic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ebox ( high standard mirror - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the default treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , in which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed . &quot;
October 2000 awarded the European Commission of Tak@@ ed@@ Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for the transport of accounts in the European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , v@@ aul@@ ted and wear on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the title &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also shown for the combination of insul@@ in in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate in insul@@ in and where met@@ form@@ ality is in@@ appropriate due to contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ations or in@@ compatibility . ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a heart in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or o@@ de@@ me , particularly those with reduced me@@ tic reserve . &quot;
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a heart in@@ suff@@ iciency in which Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insul@@ in .
a cardiovascular out@@ patient study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased intake of liver enzy@@ mes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror is up to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the norm@@ ality , the liver enzy@@ mes are as soon as possible to control . &quot;
&quot; if a patient is developing to point out on a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ enligh@@ tened nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , ti@@ ch@@ ess@@ ness and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ mes to check . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on continued , should be guided by the clinical assessment of the clinical assessment of the clinical assessment . &quot;
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has been proven a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain , which can be sti@@ ff@@ ed by obesity and in some cases associated with a fluid re@@ tention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a her@@ mitage , in the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on occurred a low reduction of the middle hem@@ ost@@ al values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ og@@ ram ( relative reduction by 4.3 % ) . &quot;
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of Hä@@ mo@@ ck@@ skin around 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lesser extent also in patients under Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and insul@@ in ( relative reduction of Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ om@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.7 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insul@@ in@@ sensitivity , in patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as a oral twin @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ try therapy with insul@@ in is obtained , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch was reported in the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , on a appearance or a deterioration of a di@@ ab@@ etic Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms with a reduction in visual ac@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ ms , but compar@@ atively doctors should report about the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ ms ; a suitable ophthal@@ mic diagnosis should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages of unwanted events in random@@ ized , controlled , double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.@@ 100 patients , treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the reduced frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular disease , occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 0.5 Fr@@ ak@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients with pic@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients with patients infected with patients ( 0.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or that comes , the treatment is ab@@ duc@@ ted ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ euticals or pharmac@@ euticals , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with pharmac@@ euticals , which are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ale contr@@ az@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ er are not expected . &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) result in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ Indu@@ ector ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is attri@@ but@@ able to that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces the consumption of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insul@@ in resistance of the dam@@ aging and thus reducing the availability of the metabo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individuals : unknown ( from present data not noticeable ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the Tur@@ g@@ or and the b@@ illing index@@ es of the lens , as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T drives on the tri@@ pod of the upper limit of the normal range , often occurs on how to plac@@ ebo , however rare as in comparison with met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
&quot; in an out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , the frequency of a severe heart in@@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than on plac@@ ebo , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ f . &quot;
since the market launch rarely over heart in@@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has been reported more frequently if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was applied in combination with insul@@ in or in patients with heart in@@ suff@@ iciency in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
&quot; a summary analysis of messages of unwanted events in random@@ ized , controlled , double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and more than 7.@@ 400 patients in the treatment of compar@@ ative groups . &quot;
&quot; during a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , Fr@@ ak@@ textures appeared at 44 / 870 ( 5.5 % ) of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2,5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; at intake the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which results in the animal model to increased insul@@ in and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose in the event of insul@@ in resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de versus mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the after@@ math of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &gt; 8,@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the treatment , a blood sugar control was defined ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients treated under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo@@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar has been inadequate in spite of three months , at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value around 0,45 % , compared to the patients , which continues to insul@@ in insul@@ in ; a reduction in insul@@ in in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on &apos;s group was observed . &quot;
in clinical trials over a year at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the album / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ equ@@ es compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was checked in a small , on 18 weeks of submitted investigation to type @-@ 2 di@@ abe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction of the total plas@@ ma tri@@ gly@@ co@@ ders and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as reduced , but clin@@ ically not significant L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels observed . &quot;
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plastic gly@@ co@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
compared to plac@@ ebo under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was not found a statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol levels while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values were observed .
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not only improve the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the number of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption , as well as on the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ ca@@ es@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ised in groups with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease in groups , which were obtained over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is rapidly res@@ or@@ bit , with the top concentration of un@@ change@@ able pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in the plas@@ ma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the efficacy in about the triple of the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative efficiency of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ action studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on could not be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ euticals or pharmac@@ euticals , war@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ Indu@@ ector ) increases or lo@@ wers the plas@@ ma centr@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after the use of radio@@ active pic@@ tured pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the f@@ eces ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean plastic @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary period of un@@ change@@ able pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to humans 5 @-@ 6 hours and that of the entire active Met@@ abol@@ ism lies at 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plas@@ ma centr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its met@@ as@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function , but with reduced clearance of the mother &apos;s clearance . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , with mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agreed upon repeated administration of Plas@@ ma volume , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ trop@@ y . &quot;
this is attri@@ but@@ able to that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ished in the gest@@ ation of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insul@@ in resistance to the dam@@ aging and thus reducing the availability of the metabo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were in@@ duced by hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( with male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epith@@ eli@@ um .
in a veterinary model of the family @-@ jo@@ at@@ elle pol@@ yp@@ osis ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ tic indi@@ ans led to an increased frequency of pist@@ on@@ ists .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the title &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reduced frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular disease , occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 0.5 Fr@@ ak@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients with pic@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients with patients infected with patients ( 0.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
in a further study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were examined .
clinical trials over one year at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the album / Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ equ@@ es compared to the output values .
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but improved in addition to the Com@@ y@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ d absorption , as well as on the hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ licensed nat@@ u@@ er@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was mis@@ understood as regards its primary flow , a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ deadly coron@@ ary syndrome , conc@@ ul@@ arization , ac@@ ul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , reveal the results that with the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on are not connected with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the title &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages of unwanted events in random@@ ized , controlled , double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and received an increased incidence of bone bro@@ ods in women . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular disease , occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 0.5 Fr@@ ak@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients with pic@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients with patients infected with patients ( 0.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ae need to be adjusted when combined with a number of other drugs administ@@ ered based on blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) result in the conclusion that the benefits of ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane over@@ l@@ ull the advantages of diabetes to the risks of diabetes .
October 2002 the European Commission shared with the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
&quot; mixed insul@@ in products are usually applied once or twice daily , when a quick initi@@ ale effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
&quot; injection @-@ needle must be bother@@ ed under the skin at least 6 seconds , to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; patients whose blood sugar has improved significantly for example by a intensified insul@@ in therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insul@@ int@@ yp ( fast acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic , long @-@ effective insul@@ in , human@@ insul@@ in or insul@@ in mechanical ) and / or producer method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insul@@ in origin ) can lead to that a change in dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; in case you need to be necessary for a dose to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the patient , it can be necessary during the first weeks or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients where hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insul@@ in occurred , reported that the early war@@ nings symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia was less pronounced or different from their previous insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; travelling over several periods , the patient should be pointed out to obtain the advice of his doctor , since such trips can lead to that insul@@ in and meals have to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor therefore needs to take possible interactions in the therapy and always ask his patients to ask for others of them .

&quot; if the ur@@ inary tract runs after two to four weeks , more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ites , the dose can be increased once daily 120 mg once daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment session , the patients are still possible to occur ; therefore , the patients are advised to take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for contrac@@ eption . &quot;

&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol each year . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary tract in the blood was placed in the blood of the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study we had 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once every day 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients , which has once daily 120 mg in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
in comparison with 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with cardi@@ ac disease in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;

the AP@@ EX study showed in view of lowering the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sec@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ egel below 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see chart 2 and figure 1 ) the statisti@@ cally used doses of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .

primary final point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney dys@@ functions The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney functional ( . ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C the primary reference point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient . &quot;
&quot; there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of percentage retreat of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ äu@@ er Con@@ centr@@ ations , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary final point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ äu@@ ge@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations &gt; 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ äu@@ er concentration of &gt; 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years consisted of an open compar@@ ative study study on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) a decrease of incidence of g@@ ging cases required so that less than 3 % of the patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against an G@@ ich@@ tsch@@ ub ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of g@@ ging no@@ du@@ es , which had in 54 % of the patient a complete dis@@ appearance of fer@@ til@@ ation up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - Values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.5 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .

for cans between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C which is larger than the dos@@ is@@ dis@@ proportionate increase .
after taking simpler or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.5 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change has been observed in the percentage decrease in Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ äu@@ er concentration , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range of 29 to 75 l after taking out doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the Plas@@ map@@ red connection of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is about 99@@ ,@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is achieved via the concentration of concentration that is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder , in which the bones are ch@@ ased ) in women after men@@ opause , where a risk for a low vitamin D mirror exists . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or in@@ taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vit@@ amine supplement ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irrit@@ ation of es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must take up until after the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet must not lie down . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from one another in drugs called in the European Union , the company laid out data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE related to the increase in vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D was treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also introduced data to show that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose exactly is the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ ature apparatus ( muscles , bone , or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tive apparatus , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ ic ( diges@@ tion ) , dy@@ sp@@ ine ( blo@@ wing ) , sp@@ ri@@ mal Ab@@ dom@@ es ( curved belly ) as well as sau@@ res . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other components may not be applied AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 presented the European Commission to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a licence for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE approved in the entire European Union .
&quot; white @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the tear of a button on one side and &quot; &quot; 710 &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is just with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or inv@@ ading of medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) for the day . &quot;
following critics are exactly to follow in order to reduce the risk of es@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must be sw@@ allowed after the end of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ ynge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , which should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ timo , active gast@@ ro@@ unders or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ oft@@ in@@ al@@ tr@@ act except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tics , only under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; eco @-@ scale reactions , such as Ö@@ soph@@ ism , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ gly@@ ph@@ tures , were rarely followed by patients by Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these were severe and demanded a hospital ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore be attentive to all signs and symptoms that indicate to possible ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , and the patients should be pointed out , in the appearance of symptoms of th@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain , or new or tri@@ mm@@ ated pain , or prevent medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe anti@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients , which may not take correct the drug and / or it after the appearance of symptoms that indicate to a po@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all the way instructions are passed to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large cases clinical studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at risk has been found , rarely ( after market launch ) gast@@ ric and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the pin@@ ers , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or of a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapeutic ré@@ g@@ ime was primarily intraven@@ ously by intraven@@ ous Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there is no data available to give indications , whether the abbrevi@@ ation of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a ki@@ os@@ surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the pine . &quot;
the clinical assessment of the treatment doctor is leading to the therapy planning for each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take the tablet by taking a dose as AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet next morning after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the week@@ day planned . &quot;
other diseases which may affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D @-@ lack and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ pe@@ oi@@ tism before the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE also should be treated .
&quot; al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium suppl@@ ementary , ant@@ acid and some or@@ ale medicines can imp@@ air the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait after taking al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interactions studies have not been carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical studies have been taken together with a variety of usually prescribed drugs , without clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ dependen@@ cies appeared . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy nor by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly compens@@ ating effects in terms of pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the pin@@ ers was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ ates ; most reports have been reported by cancer patients , but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ os@@ ep@@ it@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , withdraw@@ als of the Ser@@ um @-@ Cal@@ ci@@ ums up to &lt; 8,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Ser@@ um@@ - phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2,@@ 0 mg / dl ( Rev@@ . m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as a result of a or@@ alen over@@ dose can occur Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ er@@ emia and side @-@ side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ mat , So@@ d@@ amping , eco @-@ soph@@ ism , Gast@@ ri@@ tis or Ul@@ zer@@ a . &quot;

the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at on bone mass and frac@@ turing in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture assessment study ( FIT : N = 6.@@ 459 ) .
in the Phase III studies the middle asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the sp@@ inal column , 5.5 % on the female and 7.8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the sti@@ ckers of the BM@@ D of sp@@ ine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continues to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ed controlled studies in which Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continue to be taken by either 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the appearance of at least one new ver@@ teb@@ rates by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.8 % to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption applied to a intraven@@ ous reference rate was the mean or@@ ale bi@@ over@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at for women between 5 and 70 mg after night @-@ intensive fasting and two hours before recording of a standardized breakfast .
&quot; bio@@ availability took according to approximately 100 % and drives % , if al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed breakfast . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
healthy pro@@ b@@ ances led the gift of oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) to no clin@@ ically in@@ timi@@ dating of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age ( increase in the average range of 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats have proven that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at appears to be distributed after intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg temporarily into soft parts , but then swi@@ f@@ tly spread to the bones , or with the urine . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at were found around 50 % of the radio@@ active substance within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ eces .
after intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic Clear@@ ance is not exce@@ eding 200 ml / min .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at will not be retired in rats , not via the su@@ re or bas@@ al transpor@@ ts@@ ystem of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that by humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines influenced by these transport systems . &quot;

ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ active vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy volunteers were the mean discharge of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2.8 % , in the f@@ anning after 4 days 4.4 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the share of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , who is not distr@@ acted in the bone , is quickly carried out over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , nevertheless it is expected to reck@@ on that the ren@@ al Eli@@ mination of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in the animals are also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft have already been deployed in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gr@@ aft and data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney operations , whereby the application of Adv@@ oc@@ raf was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indic@@ ator of the effectiveness was the number of patients where the transpl@@ ant was consumed after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , for example , how often a renewed organ transpl@@ ant or a revival of the di@@ aly@@ sis required ) . &quot;
&quot; moreover , more studies have been carried out on 119 patients with kidney transpl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ ant and studied , such as Adv@@ oc@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft from the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with high hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ id antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any other components may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines must be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ oc@@ raf as the Adv@@ ag@@ raf @-@ dose or the dose of the same drug must be adjusted accordingly .

&quot; only doctors , who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transpl@@ ant patients , should arrange this medicine or make changes in the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic Ex@@ pos@@ ure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ splan@@ ts or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ immun@@ o@@ vers@@ aries . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changing the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the narro@@ wn@@ ess control of one in the transpl@@ ant medical physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in a consequence of a conversion to an alternative formulation , it must be implemented for therapeutic surveillance and appropriate dose adap@@ table to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ raf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ based regulations ( see below &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ d@@ ations &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ks should be controlled prior to conversion and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 was the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a talent mirror , with both form@@ ulations in both kidney and liver @-@ tran@@ splan@@ ts patients . &quot;
careful and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant under Adv@@ ag@@ raf in order to ensure adequate substance exposure to the immediate tran@@ splan@@ tion phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can last several days until the Ste@@ ady State achieved . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient is not allowed in the first post@@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be intraven@@ ous 5 mg / ml of conc@@ ent@@ arte to produce an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;

&quot; further Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ ters can later be required , since the pharmac@@ opo@@ eia can change from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transpl@@ ant . &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver transpl@@ ant pro@@ phy@@ xis of tran@@ splan@@ tion The or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ raf @-@ therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; Dos@@ is@@ recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf must be converted to a transpl@@ ant dose of twice daily intake of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Adv@@ oc@@ raf , so this change in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transpl@@ ant after a shift from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ oc@@ raf once a day the treatment is recommended in kidney and liver transpl@@ ant initi@@ als recommended for prophy@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ splan@@ tion .
cardi@@ ac transpl@@ ant Parti@@ al patients who are converted to Adv@@ oc@@ raf is an or@@ ale Initi@@ al dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily at once in the morning .
&quot; other tran@@ splan@@ ts , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ oc@@ raf in pneum@@ atic , p@@ ank@@ ment and ectal sep@@ tic patients , came in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in intestinal tran@@ splan@@ ts in an or@@ c initi@@ ator dose of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day to use . &quot;
dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ ations in special patient @-@ groups patients with reduced liver function Z@@ ur maintenance of blood cells in the su@@ vers@@ ed area may be necessary in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a lowering of the dose required .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function because kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ opo@@ lies of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ as@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um cre@@ mation levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ incl@@ in@@ ance and a monitoring of ur@@ inary tract ) . &quot;
conversion from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ raf When changing from a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in@@ - to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; recommendations for the Tal@@ ks in full bl@@ ut The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case , under the hel@@ pl@@ ess of whol@@ eness @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ks controls . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ks during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant , followed by peri@@ odi@@ c controls during the entertainment therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change according to conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or even more simultaneous application of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical trials can be made possible that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the talents level in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml do not exceed . &quot;
in clinical practice the valley of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in the first time of liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations in 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the following therapy for liver therapy , kidney and heart tran@@ splan@@ ts were generally used for blood concentration in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this led to serious unwanted events , including tran@@ splan@@ ts or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ lap . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changing the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the narro@@ wn@@ ess control of one in the transpl@@ ant medical physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transpl@@ ant treatment , which has proven itself from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants as therapy , are still no clinical data for re@@ tar@@ ded phrase Adv@@ oc@@ raf . &quot;
the prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant@@ at@@ ant recept@@ acle in adult ant@@ transpl@@ ant recei@@ vers and tran@@ splan@@ ts are still no clinical data for re@@ tar@@ ded phrase Adv@@ oc@@ raf .
&quot; because of possible interactions formed to lead to a degrad@@ ation of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal medicine is included ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , or to avoid other plant remedies during a treatment with Adv@@ oc@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subjected to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , was referred to as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy , Kam@@ mer@@ - or sep@@ tic hyper@@ trop@@ hies could be observed , which therefore can also occur under Adv@@ oc@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid loading and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the inclusion of sunlight or UV light should be restricted to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a solar protection by using a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for P@@ RES like head@@ aches , changing consciousness levels , cr@@ amps and visual dys@@ functions , should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g . &quot;

&quot; the simultaneous application of drugs or herbal remedies that are known as a inhibit@@ or or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - Blo@@ od of substances , which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintaining equ@@ il@@ able concentr@@ ations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly marked interaction was made with an@@ tim@@ cot@@ ics such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol and with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ants ( z . &quot;

&quot; high @-@ do@@ omed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute waste , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower . &quot;
&quot; effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be metabo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 metabo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us down the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive , and thus to increase hormones , is particularly careful in decisions about recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animals have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their sem@@ inal @-@ time .
&quot; the results of a small number of investigations on transpl@@ ant patients do not provide an indication that among other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , an increased risk of unwanted events related to the course and result of pregnancy . &quot;

dosage and frequency of application are directed to whether Adv@@ ent is applied to the treatment of ble@@ eding or to the prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII @-@ lack which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as ble@@ eding in the joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plas@@ ma but manufactured by a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which an Gen ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the human sense factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similarly , however , is different , so that the drug contains no proteins and animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was examined by means of prevention and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ates in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tum with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; respectively . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ates ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess , head@@ aches , Py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ent may not be applied in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human body factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ st or one of the other components . &quot;
March 2004 the European Commission backed B@@ ax@@ ter AG shared a licence for the transport of Adv@@ ates throughout the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution treatment are directed according to the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ man@@ gels in accordance with the place and the extent of the blood circulation and the clinical state of the patient .
in the following here@@ tical events the factor VIII activity in the appropriate period is not due to the stated Plas@@ ma level ( in % of standard or in i.e. / dl ) sin@@ ks .
injection of 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection of all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat the danger for the patient over .
&quot; during the treatment session , it is applied to control the dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plastic seal . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value .

&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plas@@ ma will not be reached or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled by a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out if necessary to prove an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ tic , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic interventions must be wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; the order speed should be directed after the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , according to Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plas@@ ma means by modi@@ fying Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say . &quot;
&quot; to develop the risk of inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ positioning days is the largest and of genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) , with more than 100 ex@@ position and an@@ am@@ nest@@ ing known in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ development was observed , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the rein@@ deer of ( reduced ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women lie about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation , no experience . &quot;
&quot; in case of the largest number of patients infected with factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all appeared in previously untreated patients who have had a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rarely &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of available data does not fail ) . &quot;

&quot; in previously not treated patients with a regular clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients in@@ hi@@ bit@@ es against factor VIII . &quot;
the immune response of the patients upon traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed due to the study of the anti@@ body against these proteins , lab parameters and gem@@ el@@ ded side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ lift@@ ment as well as an ongoing Peak of the anti@@ body mirror against anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell , otherwise there appeared no sign or symptoms related to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial launch of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP will continue to be assessed as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored from the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the safety pro@@ fil@@ s of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which is necessary for the filing of PS@@ UR@@ s all 6 months , that the authorisation will apply for 5 years for a further renewal procedure . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited Committee on the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) officially launched its application for approval for the In@@ struction for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft@@ ness ( tissues that links other structures in the body , surrounds and base ) of it . &quot;
&quot; this is a type of virus that has gene@@ tically modified , that it can carry a gene to the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ exin is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; which has changed so that there cannot be copies of itself and cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ exin could have donated directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is not formed from the def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company laid out data from a study with a patient in front of the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of the building , in the bones , and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP the answers of the company on the questions asked , were still some questions uns@@ ol@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; based on testing the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP is made on day 120 a list of questions which is sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , the injection of Adv@@ exin in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore has been advantages for the patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns relating to the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company has not proven sufficient that Adv@@ exin can be established in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the CH@@ MP did not take note of whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients , who currently participate in clinical studies or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ exin . &quot;
changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so mer@@ ged that one of the effective constitu@@ ents will be released immediately and the other is slowly released over a few hours .
&quot; Aer@@ ina@@ ze is applied to the treatment of symptoms of seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s ( h@@ ay fever , by an allergy to the nas@@ al irrit@@ ation ) in patients with nas@@ al irrit@@ ating skin swelling ( tax@@ able nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and young people older than 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ ina@@ ze is twice a tablet with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ ger@@ m ( pet@@ ri@@ fied nose ) , sealed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be en@@ forced on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main most effective dimensions were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ yst@@ ine deficiency symptoms that were reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary set up with a standard sk@@ ala as hard the symptoms during the last 12 hours were .
&quot; considering all h@@ ay symptoms of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ ina@@ ze reported , about a decrease of symptoms by 46,@@ 0 % , compared to 35,@@ 9 % in the patient , the pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nose @-@ ger@@ m was regarded , the patients showed under Aer@@ ina@@ ze a lens of symptoms by 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % against 26,@@ 7 % in the patient , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st ( coron@@ ary ) , embarrass@@ ment , fatigue , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ mer@@ gence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , in@@ som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ ina@@ ze may be in patient , which may be super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against the erge agents or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ ina@@ ze may also not be applied in patients suffering from a bott@@ angle glau@@ coma ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , or have had a risk for a hem@@ orrho@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission of the company SP Europe shared a licence for the transport of Aer@@ ina@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is in the whole to sw@@ allow ( that is , without cr@@ ashed or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
Aer@@ ina@@ ze should be applied due to the lack of data to infin@@ ity and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) not in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after breaking the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use of use on 10 days , because in long @-@ term application the activity of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease with time . &quot;
&quot; after the decline of the v@@ eiling of the v@@ eils in the upper respir@@ ation , the treatment can be continued when needed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ ina@@ ze Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contr@@ ain@@ dicated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amin@@ ants ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tical activity in combination use of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ a such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Lis@@ ur@@ id , lat@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , Eph@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , Eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective , and does not cover the data to speak corresponding recommendations to dosage . &quot;
the safety and the effectiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver enzy@@ mes and the data are not enough to speak corresponding recommendations to dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about the treatment in occurrence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or of Pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of following patients , patients suffering from digital age groups • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ als in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bli@@ en@@ hal@@ so@@ b@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ ina@@ ze is ab@@ duc@@ ted at least 48 hours before the execution of dermat@@ ological testing , since Anti@@ hist@@ amine can prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin transactions or to be reduced in its extent . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol additionally agreed , however , were not observed with clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plas@@ ma centr@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences could be determined between the patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; this enzy@@ me for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , enzy@@ mes was not yet identified , so interactions with other drugs can not be ruled out completely . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ conceivable of the application of Aer@@ ina@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies however no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population . &quot;
&quot; as reproduction studies to animals are not always transmitted to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ical characteristics of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should however be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases it can come to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to impair@@ ment of the traffic and ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a n@@ b @-@ depression ( Se@@ en@@ coding , ap@@ nea , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , heart circulation ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ to@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; head@@ aches , anxiety , complicated Mik@@ tion , muscle weak@@ ens and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st , pal@@ pit@@ ations , embarrass@@ ment , embarrass@@ ment , anxiety , respir@@ ation , visual dys@@ functions and hyper@@ tension , or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a T@@ NS stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children as well as the at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( m@@ outh@@ dry , p@@ up@@ lifted and - di@@ lat@@ ation , Hau@@ tr@@ mia , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ uter symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the im@@ puri@@ fication of the fl@@ ex@@ ical cycles of cy@@ to@@ k@@ inen like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es one as well as the in@@ pression of the expression of the Ad@@ here@@ sion@@ al molec@@ ule . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement performance , including the ampli@@ fication subjective fl@@ aws , or the tasks that are connected to the compart@@ ment . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended Dos@@ age of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of be@@ aks compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the oral application of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can generate additional person@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; it took 1,@@ 248 patients at the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , whereby 4@@ 14 patients were received Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets , determines on the basis of the overall cor@@ es for symptoms ( except Nas@@ en@@ ger@@ mination or@@ bit@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in over the 2 @-@ week treatment times . &quot;
the effectiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets with regard to the down@@ swing effect was significantly higher than under a mon@@ oph@@ ile of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment times .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in relation to gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
in the framework of a single dose to the Phar@@ mar@@ ine@@ tic study of Aer@@ ina@@ ze is Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin within 30 minutes after administration in plas@@ ma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ ina@@ ze for healthy pro@@ b@@ bled over 14 days the flow of flu@@ ence of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine is reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ is@@ study , which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet by healthy adult pro@@ b@@ bled , was determined that four proportions of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was badly damaged . &quot;
&quot; a component instance shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , according to the all@@ ot@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , according to the all@@ ot@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ equivalent was the exposure to gift of a Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablet . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety reporting , tox@@ icity in repeat@@ ability and reproductive medicine , the pre@@ clinical data can be recognized with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin but does not recognize any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the substance pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the or@@ atory gift of up to 150 mg / kg / day and of rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ at@@ ogen . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us was tested in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness has been measured by changing the symptoms ( itch , number and size of the squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance of the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body has the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets in the same way , as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; allergic rh@@ initi@@ s led when the results of all trials were assessed together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of the symptom ( symptom points ) by 25 to 26 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patient who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the withdrawal of the symptom after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared to plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or any other components . &quot;

&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms associated with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ c@@ eful rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are limited experience from clinical trials for the effectiveness of the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin with young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections , 4.8 and 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment of the inter@@ acting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to previous path@@ ologies and may end up after the end of symptoms and may be resum@@ ed after the end of the symptoms .
the physical allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms over 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been found in the context of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets were not found in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ acon@@ az@@ ol also administ@@ ered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , equ@@ itable intake of co@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not enhanced with the performance of alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied in fact that in very rare cases it can come to Ben@@ ade@@ dness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of the traffic and ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with as@@ eri@@ us , when in patients with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most commonly used side effects , above the more common than in plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , m@@ outh@@ dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0,@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 578 y@@ outh@@ ful patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side head@@ ache head@@ ache , this stood at 5.2 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and treated with 6.6 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ subject study , which has been administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) have been observed no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the im@@ puri@@ fication of the du@@ st@@ ine cy@@ to@@ k@@ inen like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es one as well as the im@@ itation of the expression of the Ad@@ here@@ sion@@ al molec@@ ule P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ ine on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multi @-@ expert study , which has been administ@@ ered in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administ@@ ered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; at a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement performance , including the ampli@@ fication subjective fl@@ aws , or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s was A@@ eri@@ us effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and itch of the nose , mo@@ ur@@ ging and redness of eyes as well as itch on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided depending on the duration of symptoms and also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ acting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall cor@@ es of the frag@@ ment of life for quality of life at Rhin@@ o sub@@ vi@@ tis , dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us effectively , caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria has been viol@@ ating for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria since the underlying path@@ physiological ology irrespective of ae@@ ti@@ ology can be similar to different forms and chronic patients may be easier to recru@@ ited .
&quot; since the history of history is an urs@@ al factor in all ur@@ ari@@ al diseases , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin will also lead in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in enhancing pr@@ ur@@ itus and the cul@@ mination of size and number of squares at the end of the first tin intervals .
&quot; as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients , which are not excluded from Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch to more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin treated patients compared to 19 % of patients with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; the treatment with ap@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and vig@@ or , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmaceutical industrial study , where patients with the general seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s were comparable with the general seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s population , was achieved by 4 % of the patient a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no cl@@ amping points for a clin@@ ically relevant coll@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , for the met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , enzy@@ mes was not yet identified , so interactions with other drugs have not been excluded completely . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ one .
&quot; in a single @-@ dos@@ ed study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7.5 mg real meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) does not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the clinical trials performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin , at a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences in tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety reporting , tox@@ icity in repeat@@ ability and reproductive medicine , the pre@@ clinical data can be recognized with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no particular dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , for reli@@ eving the symptoms associated with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ c@@ eful rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by children under 2 years by an infection ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a inf@@ ective rh@@ initi@@ s with as@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ alies should be played in the diagnosis the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and appropriate laboratories and skin tests . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabo@@ li@@ zed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin limited and experienced a higher sub@@ mounting load ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which is restricted to metabo@@ li@@ ze , is identical with the children that normally metabo@@ li@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients should not take with inherited problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , gluten @-@ free absorption or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been found in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not found in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ acon@@ az@@ ol also administ@@ ered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol have not been reinforced the powerful effect of alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was at the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and young people in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , as in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ test study of adults and young people , with which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) were administ@@ ered ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) have been observed no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;

because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin by adults and children can be similar to the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin by adults on the population &apos;s population .
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple adults and young people , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in a dosage of up to 20 mg per day was applied daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study on adult and young people , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended Dos@@ age of 5 mg daily for adults and teenagers have found no increased frequency of be@@ aks compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and young people in clinical trials are no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or .

&quot; the spread of this limited metabo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) as in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; related pharmac@@ opo@@ etic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ study study with the sy@@ up@@ form of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which have been restricted . &quot;
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 3 to 6 hours approximately 6@@ mal higher and the C@@ max about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a tempor@@ al half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no cl@@ amping points for a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and young people .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. is officially approved by the Committee for Human@@ itarian H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ In@@ flu@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied by adults and elderly people to protect flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the In@@ flu@@ enza @-@ A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine , which could cause a strain of influ@@ enza virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a gri@@ p@@ pe@@ pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out , when a new tribe of the flu is emerging , which can easily spread from man to man because people have not built any immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; according to administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system the parts of the grip virus as &quot; &quot; physical &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
thus the immune system will be able to form a contact with a grip virus of this pedi@@ ms more quickly .
&quot; then the membrane ke@@ epers of the virus with the &quot; &quot; surface &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as a body @-@ alien ) , has been able to agree on and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; some inspection of some of the study group showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with &quot; &quot; Good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the security of the vaccine is not made to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA , for pan@@ de@@ mic vaccines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need additional information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by human immun@@ om@@ weak@@ evi@@ rus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) that are caused by the Imm@@ une Def@@ iciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot sw@@ allow the capsules as a solution to one , but these can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the security of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generative ase should only be en@@ acted when the doctor has checked , which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has judged that the virus is attached to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ als depends on the body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , as@@ generic drugs reduce the HIV amount of blood in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS does not cure AIDS , however , can also delay the immune system of the immune system and thus also delay the development of with AIDS infections and disorders . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generative ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , who had not been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this with low do@@ si@@ re Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines of a gener@@ ase was taken with 206 adults , who had previously taken into eas@@ ing with other proteins . &quot;
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with not veri@@ fiable concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( viral burden ) or modification of the viral burden after the treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ection@@ ers had made more patients an Vir@@ us@@ last under 400 copies / ml than among plac@@ ebo , but A@@ generative ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of children , A@@ generative ase also decreased the Vir@@ us@@ last , but with the children , who were treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ants , very few to the treatment mentioned earlier . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , which had been treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ants , which had been treated as effective with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicines of the Vir@@ age &apos;s viral medicines just as effective as other proteins : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resist@@ ed against four other proteins , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as in the patient , which took their previous proteins : &quot;
&quot; the common side effects of A@@ generative ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( blood ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ generative ase may not be applied in patients that may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; A@@ generative ase may also not be applied in patients , which is cur@@ ated ( a herbal supplements to treat depression ) or drugs that are just as used as a gener@@ ase and are to be taken in high concentr@@ ations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other drugs against HIV consists in patients who are taking the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( symptoms of an infection that will be caused by the immune immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) result in the conclusion that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ generative ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Ver@@ stronger Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee stated that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ are taken in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who has previously taken no proteins . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generative ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; , &quot; because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information templates . &quot;
October 2000 awarded the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited by the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited filed an approval for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
&quot; generic medicines is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , protein ( PI ) for adults and children from 4 years of age . &quot;
&quot; for usual , A@@ generative ase is to be administ@@ ered capsules to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration the individual viral resistance movement and the treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to capture is 14 % lower than of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ generative are capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram of a milli@@ gram base does not inter@@ change@@ able ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generative capsules amounts to 600 mg of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generative or capsules will be applied without the pre@@ amps of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generative capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ pharmac@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and security of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ection@@ ers were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the mis@@ use of data to infin@@ ity and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose to as@@ generic capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver enzy@@ mes on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application is intended to be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver enzy@@ me , in patients with severe liver enzy@@ me , it is con@@ dense ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generative ase is not allowed to be given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals , which possess a small therapeutic width and also provide sub@@ str@@ ate of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ cyclop@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal supplements that may contain cur@@ ic@@ eb@@ aut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied due to risk reduction plas@@ ma centr@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is not applied ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generative or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ is does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contam@@ ination with blood .
&quot; for usually , A@@ generative ase capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have an increased risk of severe liver interactions with potentially deadly disease . &quot;
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine . &quot;
patients with previously reserved liver enzy@@ mes including chronic hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous application of as@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ e@@ ids , which can be confused via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended that the potential benefits of a treat the risk of system@@ ic @-@ ster@@ oids of the effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ lies of the adren@@ al function weighs ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and Sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
&quot; 4 For some drugs , may cause serious or life threatening effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the drug con@@ formity . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take these medicines at the same time , a gener@@ ase can be less effective because of decreased plas@@ mas@@ ons of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r less effective ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabo@@ lic interactions with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on o@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must be administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity of tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ ph@@ any of children under an age of four years , it should be applied to children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution when certain other patients . &quot;
&quot; ax@@ ase should be set on duration 5 , if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the v@@ eils is involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including proteins , was reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exception of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases of whose treatment drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
&quot; de@@ pu@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous z@@ ut@@ ans ha@@ emat@@ ography and hem@@ og@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective can be developed at the time of the introduction of anti@@ retro@@ viral infections ( ART ) an anti @-@ inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to serious clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial ether is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol intake , heavy organic soup , higher body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , reported cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeu@@ tical width is not at the same time displayed with medicinal products which represent a small therapeutic width and also provide sub@@ str@@ ate of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ cyclop@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of a gener@@ ase with chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with pharmac@@ euticals whose molecular entities are primarily associated with pharmac@@ euticals and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and to a resistance development .
&quot; in trying to emig@@ rate the de@@ gr@@ ated plas@@ mas@@ ystem by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects were observed at the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ spiegel of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already cur@@ ated cur@@ rant , the Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r@@ ally and , if possible to check the viral burden and ab@@ ject the cur@@ ic@@ eb@@ aut . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz bottom ) .
5@@ 08 % increased for C@@ max against 30 % lower when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered .
&quot; in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily , and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and infin@@ ity of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as . &quot;
52 % lower when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in Plas@@ ma which were obtained in combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
&quot; a set @-@ up recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , there will be a narro@@ wer monitoring , as the effectiveness and in@@ conceivable of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there has been no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study conducted in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , is recommended due to the anta@@ bio@@ cides component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ generative ase is at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz is required in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz is not recommended in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ection@@ ers would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ on to other proteins and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ into the Ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r may lo@@ wers .
&quot; if this medicine should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable , since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the decrease and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic levels could be less effective . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ cal surveillance should be made , since a precise pre@@ diction of the effects of the combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous seal of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in the plas@@ ma centr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to a rise in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase is required to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
pharmac@@ ogen@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out but might be the plas@@ mas@@ ium of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ az@@ ol with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or indu@@ ction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , could potentially lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions which are connected to these drugs if they are applied in combination with an@@ ec@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other proteins , it is advisable that Ant@@ azi@@ da may not be taken at the same time as a gener@@ ase , as it can occur as res@@ or@@ ting disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of antibodies known as enzy@@ mes ( Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plas@@ mas@@ ium of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium modules such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous in@@ ges@@ tion with map@@ ase , its Plas@@ tic@@ on@@ zentr@@ ations can increase significantly and reinforce with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in a clinical trial in Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg of capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days of pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ sp@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days dropped by about 86 % decreased ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval ( 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous arrest of as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oids , unless that the potential benefits of a treatment exce@@ eds the risk of system@@ ic @-@ ster@@ oids in the effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors like Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose contrac@@ tion is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases of the plas@@ mas@@ ons in simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ als . &quot;
as plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ping increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ se will not be recommended using this medicine with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; it will be a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations up to the stabili@@ zation of the mirror , since the plas@@ ma centr@@ alization of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ generative ase may not be applied together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while on equal use of as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
&quot; data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other proteins , indicate a possible increase in the plas@@ mas@@ ystem from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 @-@ fold . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if it is also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the per se low distor@@ tions of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given as the Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be administ@@ ered out when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous interaction of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ c anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with as@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of anti @-@ thro@@ pods effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predic@@ table ; therefore alternative methods for receptions is recommended .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous arrest of map@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful waste of the possible loss for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; in fact , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people into the breast milk . &quot;
a reproduction study of impair@@ ments which was administ@@ ered by the armament in the uter@@ ine to the end of the stagn@@ ation period Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight .
the further development of the sur@@ ren@@ unci@@ ation including fer@@ til@@ isation and Re@@ production capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r to the mother@@ tier .
the in@@ conceivable of as@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the au@@ gener@@ ase treatment associated effects were easy to moderate , played early and led rarely to the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of map@@ ase or any other at the same time as HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the admir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; most of the below side effects originate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ eas@@ ants may not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which have been valued and valued by the investig@@ ator as in connection with the study medication , and at more than 1 % of patients appeared , as well as under the treatment assignment . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat , including a loss of periph@@ er@@ em and fa@@ ç@@ ade tissues , multip@@ lied and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissues , hyper@@ trop@@ y of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ al fats . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ fit , not pre @-@ treated persons , which had been treated with am@@ ot@@ en@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ in over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was only observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , at 245 NR@@ TI@@ - treated patients under Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various NR@@ TI@@ s over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; ras@@ hes were usually easy to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mak@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without itch , and van@@ ished during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks , without having to dis@@ car@@ ded the treatment with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose have been reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
with HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective can be developed at the time of the introduction of anti@@ retro@@ viral infections ( ART ) an anti @-@ inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in with PI pre @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase was observed twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ re Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) which were treated with low do@@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very common . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ do@@ zation , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ denti@@ tion ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in ak@@ ut and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blo@@ c cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as in the periph@@ eral blood cells . &quot;
the 50 % of Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 14 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ fit not pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were used - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed .
&quot; at six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ fit not pre@@ treated patients , the 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 732 , entered a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otype could be examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the insulation of 13 from 14 children , with whom a four rolog@@ ical failure did not appear in the 59 , with prot@@ eas@@ ants that was not treated for patients , showed resistance to adults . &quot;

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : N = 107 ) to patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure more than 96 weeks , the following proteins : &quot;
on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analysis of Gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be applied to the estim@@ ation of activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein @-@ resistant insul@@ ators .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ 11 @-@ algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / F / G / V / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , combined with an increased phenomen@@ al resistance , with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced lik@@ eli@@ hood of a vi@@ ro@@ c response . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ational patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to constantly draw the current inter@@ pret@@ ations to analyze the results of Resi@@ denti@@ al tests . &quot;
on ph@@ onic resistance @-@ based analysis @-@ based inter@@ pret@@ ative inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otype data for the assessment of activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein @-@ resistant insul@@ ators .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests , have clinical @-@ phenomen@@ al cut @-@ off@@ s ( parti@@ tions ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV developed to be applied for the interpretation of results of a Resi@@ denti@@ al testing . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a decrease sensitivity to Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r associ@@ ated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; currently , data on cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and other proteins for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ fit ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant insul@@ ates in ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the insul@@ ates . &quot;
the early detection of a vers@@ al therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can affect the following treatment .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure ( NR@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ do@@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred tri@@ angles ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity to A@@ generative ase , at least one other PI and at least one NR@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis introduced the non @-@ sub @-@ embarrass@@ ment of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in terms of the time @-@ adju@@ sting output of the output ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Plas@@ ma last year ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plas@@ ma after 16 weeks of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ st@@ amped A@@ generative ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies of a gener@@ ational solution to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; there was not a low do@@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) , or two ( 42 % ) who administ@@ ered together with A@@ generative ase . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients concluded a Plas@@ ma HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ ate increase in the CD@@ 4 @-@ cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Basi@@ cs on these data should be considered in the therapy optim@@ isation with PI pre @-@ treated children , which should be considered to be considered to be expected . &quot;
after oral administration is the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to maximum Ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increased for C@@ max to cut 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered .
the administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % reduction of AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dos@@ ages ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) influenced by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the scale and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the seem@@ ing capacity of approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves on a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a withdrawal of the total concentration of the activity in the plas@@ ma , whereby the amount of un@@ seen Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ born Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , fluctu@@ ating percentage of free active component in the Ste@@ ady state in the Ste@@ ady State on the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min . &quot;
&quot; hence , medicines must indu@@ ce the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or inhi@@ bits a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , given caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generative ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r Ex@@ position as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ ly , than out of the capsules ; therefore , a generic solution and dis@@ gener@@ are capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able to a milli@@ gram@@ ming base . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of kidney disease is likely to be low on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ plas@@ mas@@ ons comparable to those that will be obtained by healthy pro@@ b@@ ons after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for can@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r to mice and rats , with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ oli@@ ac@@ ular aden@@ ome in d@@ osing , who per@@ ched the 2,@@ 0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to man , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ oli@@ tic aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma were not yet glori@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on the human being , from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , have little references to the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity testing , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , Micro@@ nuclear test of rats and chromos@@ omes , was am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; so far , in clinical studies there has not been observed any significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during administration filing of map@@ ase , nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies for tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , which were treated as a high mor@@ tal disease as well as with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r &apos;s animals . &quot;
&quot; in a system@@ ic plas@@ ma Ex@@ pos@@ ure that lay significant under ( rab@@ bits ) or not significant higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , were observed a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and low @-@ day skel@@ eton @-@ changes that indicate to be consumed . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generative or capsules will be applied without the pre@@ amps of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generative capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is intended to be performed in patients with s@@ guar@@ ded or mild liver enzy@@ me with caution when patients with severe liver enzy@@ me is contr@@ ain@@ dicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life threatening effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the drug con@@ formity . &quot;
&quot; ax@@ ase should be reduced to duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the v@@ eils is involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and to a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increased for C@@ max against 30 % lower when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in Plas@@ ma which were obtained in combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
&quot; a set @-@ up recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , there will be a narro@@ wer monitoring , as the effectiveness and in@@ conceivable of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz is not recommended in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ection@@ ers would be low .
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ cal surveillance should be made , since a precise pre@@ diction of the effects of the combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase is required to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium modules such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
in a clinical trial in Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg of capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days of pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ sp@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days dropped by about 86 % decreased ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval ( 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; with simultaneous interaction of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ c anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with as@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of anti @-@ thro@@ pods effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ es@@ tradi@@ ol plus 1,0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r to 22 % b@@ z@@ f .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine must only be applied after careful waste of the potential for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
a reproduction study of impair@@ ments which was administ@@ ered by the armament in the uter@@ ine to the end of the stagn@@ ation period Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in the body weight of the offspring .
the in@@ conceivable of as@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ do@@ zation , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ denti@@ tion ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in ak@@ ut and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blo@@ c cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood cells . &quot;
the 50 % of Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 14 µ@@ g for chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ g = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant insul@@ ates in ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the insul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the treatment optim@@ isation was to be considered in the treatment of PI pre @-@ treated children of the &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ st@@ alled &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ born Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , fluctu@@ ating percentage of free active component in the Ste@@ ady state in the Ste@@ ady State on the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min . &quot;
&quot; hence , medicines must indu@@ ce the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or inhi@@ bits a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , given caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the impact of kidney disease is likely to be low on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for can@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r to mice and rats , with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ oli@@ ac@@ ular aden@@ ome in d@@ osing , who per@@ ched the 2,@@ 0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to the people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma were not yet glori@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on the human being , from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , little hints for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;

&quot; studies for tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , which were treated as a high mor@@ tal disease as well as with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r &apos;s animals . &quot;
&quot; these results let conclude that in juven@@ iles , the met@@ abol@@ ism are not yet fully mature , so Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , Prot@@ ective adult ( PI ) for adults and children from 4 years of age . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; As@@ gener@@ ase &quot; &quot; has been treated neither with PI previously treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to capture is 14 % lower than of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ generative are capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram of a milli@@ gram base does not inter@@ change@@ able ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be as soon as they are able to sw@@ allow the capsules to stop taking the remedy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generative solution is 17 mg ( 1.9 ml ) Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there must be no dosage recommendations for the simultaneous use of in@@ generative solution to capture and low do@@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided this combination with these patients . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is not necessary to be necessary , an application of as@@ gener@@ ase solution is conf@@ isc@@ ated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ ylene gly@@ ph@@ any is a generic solution for inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver fail and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive im@@ itation of the met@@ as@@ sion of these medicines and potentially cause severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generative or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 to transfer HIV to others through sexual contact or contam@@ ination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines , which can cause serious or life threatening effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the drug con@@ formity . &quot;
&quot; ax@@ ase should be reduced to duration when a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the v@@ eils is involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with the drug 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
&quot; de@@ pu@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous z@@ ut@@ ans ha@@ emat@@ ography and hem@@ og@@ thro@@ es . &quot;

&quot; in fact , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people into the breast milk . &quot;
a reproduction study of impair@@ ments which was administ@@ ered by the dis@@ armament in the uter@@ ine to the end of the stagn@@ ation period Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weight in the after@@ math .

&quot; the applic@@ ators and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the treating disease : • For F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital area , Al@@ dara is up to a maximum of 16 weeks long three times weekly . • At acute ker@@ at@@ ants , it is during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks of pause between treatment cycles , three times weekly . &quot;
&quot; the cream is hidden in front of the bed@@ time inner @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected skin @-@ surfaces , so that it remains sufficient for a long time ( about eight hours ) on the skin before they washed away . &quot;
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dara was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the substance ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area of 16 weeks . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete de@@ generation of self @-@ heating . • Al@@ dara was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell cancer in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dara or plac@@ ebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of the effectiveness of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete de@@ generation of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara also has been tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ceramics .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • At the treatment of war@@ ts in genital area , the complete desc@@ end rate was evaluated in all four main studies 15 % to 52 % in the patients with Al@@ dara patients . • The results of the two studies have been treated with Al@@ dara patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ ants ( A@@ KS ) in the face or on the scal@@ p at immune @-@ competent adults , if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are con@@ dense or less suitable . &quot;

&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream is so long to continue to have disappeared as far as all the invisible tor@@ ches in the genital area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks a treatment period . &quot;
&quot; any inter@@ ruption in the above treatment procedure should be assessed when intensive local inflammation occur ( see Section 4.4 ) , or if in the treatment area a infection is observed . &quot;
&quot; if the follow @-@ up exam@@ ines 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the l@@ esi@@ ons are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose has been left , the patient has put the cream when he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; i@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream is up to wear in a thin layer and set up in the des@@ ks , with fl@@ ex@@ war@@ ts infected , until the cream is completely in@@ duc@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in case of these patients there should be a down@@ turn , between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od and the risk associated with potential wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune diseases . &quot;
&quot; in case of these patients there should be a down@@ turn , between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ @-@ versus @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction connected . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily anticip@@ ation of hygiene was carried out , two cases of heavy phi@@ mos@@ is and one case has been observed with one to the circum@@ c@@ ision . &quot;
&quot; in an application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk for heavy local skin cuts ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases were also observed under informed application heavy local skin irrit@@ ation , which made a treatment required and / or lead to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulties in the water that require emergency cath@@ eters and treatment of the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; to use I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream directly following treatment with other k@@ ut@@ an , applied resources for the treatment of extreme f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital area and Peri@@ odi@@ al area are still no clinical experience . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest on an increased rate of f@@ eig@@ warning reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ Cre@@ am in this patient group , however , has shown a smaller effectiveness in regards to the elimination of the cas@@ eig@@ war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od within 1 cm to the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; local home interactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions will be back after treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if due to the complaints of the patient or due to sever@@ ity of local skin actions , a treatment should be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the skin to be judged 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; in fact , no data on long @-@ term heating rates are available from more than 36 months after treatment , should be considered with super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell cancer . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ r@@ ating and pre @-@ treated BC@@ C@@ s are not a clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in the early tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial suggest that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od was not tested for the treatment of acoustic ker@@ at@@ ants at ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip@@ stick within the lip area . &quot;
&quot; there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for treatment of acoustic ceramics on anatom@@ ical positions outside the face , and the scal@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ cal ker@@ at@@ osis for the under@@ poor and hands do not support the effectiveness in this use case , so such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin actions often occur on , but these reactions tend to take effect during the treatment of intensity or go back after the end of therapy with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin actions cause great discomfort or very strong , the treatment can be exposed to several days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ E@@ ditions are a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ o@@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the medicine was examined ; however , it was also measured its effectiveness ( by its effect in terms of reducing G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine and regarding the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine around about 60 % , and half of the children treated children , at the end of the study a normal big liver . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , stomach pain , skin rash , sor@@ row , pain in limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat emp@@ athy and reactions to the inf@@ usion set . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be in case of patients who may possibly be greatly exagger@@ ated ( allergic to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not applied . &quot;
&quot; the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) is every year for all new information , which may possibly be known , examine and update this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will get patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , with regard to the reactions to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
June 2003 the European Commission of Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe BV shared a licence for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cell culture ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is for long @-@ term enzy@@ mes for patients with guaranteed diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) indic@@ ted to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who owns experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary metabo@@ lic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be when the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes in single @-@ steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients there can be no faculty scheme . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not identified ; and for these patients there can be no faculty scheme .
&quot; with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms patients may develop inf@@ usion reactions , which are defined as any associated effect , which occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the inf@@ usion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , in the re @-@ operation facilities for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients are Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution by using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as little experience on the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , must be increased due to the theoretical risk of an over@@ sensitivity to an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ agents ) to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion reactions .
&quot; in the event of a slight or medium @-@ sized inf@@ usion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is expected and / or reducing inf@@ usion rate to the half of the inf@@ usion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion reaction , the inf@@ usion must be stopped , until the symptoms are reported to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and acet@@ amin@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be absorbed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred to be resum@@ ed .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Corti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate that occurred the predicted reaction .
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular reception of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms are not silent . &quot;
&quot; the side effects in clinical trials were arranged primarily as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase @-@ 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years of age ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) . &quot;
unwanted drugs actions connected to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension to a total of 45 patients aged 5 and older at age 45 or older at a period of age ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper air@@ ways and lungs in pre@@ history , moreover , heavy reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ atory and facial wr@@ aps ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ paid drug interactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study involving 20 patients aged under 5 years , with a predominantly severe delay and treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously 100 e / kg of intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 e / kg of intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
in most patients there occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version that occurred in patients aged under 5 years with a serious embarrass@@ ment form ( average after 26 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to an early retirement from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not listed by radio@@ immun@@ o@@ lic@@ able ( Rip ) As@@ say thou@@ ght@@ able antibodies before , including 3 patients where there was never been a Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with fl@@ atter@@ ing up to lower anti@@ body mirror , a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , while in patients with high antibodies form a variable reduction in G@@ AG in the Har@@ n . &quot;
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alised inhibit@@ or effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vit@@ ro which seemed to not imp@@ air the clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to be not related to the incidence of unwanted drugs actions even though the appearance of unwanted drug interactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the justi@@ fication for the enzy@@ mes therapy is in one for the Hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzy@@ me .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous Inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and cells into lymp@@ ho@@ omes , most likely about cre@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me have been studied in a random@@ ized , double blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were rec@@ ted by the study , the majority of patients were reported by the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient pointed to the serious phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were rec@@ ted when they had a for@@ ci@@ zed exp@@ ir@@ ator volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ - test test .
all patients were subsequently rec@@ ted for an open @-@ label study study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms treated patients across the plac@@ ebo group and the ability to improve in the following table . &quot;
an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 208 weeks in Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks to plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as follows from the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung @-@ vol@@ um@@ ina increased significantly to the height of growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with a hep@@ at@@ ant treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) , until the end of the study a normal liver size . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste from the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed until the end of the study .
&quot; regarding the heter@@ ogen@@ eous path@@ ogen@@ ation between the patient , which has been taken into account by using a combined repository directly ( an expected percentage range of AH@@ I and Seh@@ sharp@@ ness ) , was generally improved in 26 patients ( 22 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a single @-@ year open phase @-@ 2 study conducted by Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in 20 patients , which at the time of their inclusion in the study were under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy ver@@ ge form and 4 with the middle term form ) . &quot;
in four patients the dosage was increased by increased G@@ AG@@ - Spiegel in the har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was established after the Z Score for this age group The younger patients with the heavy ver@@ ge form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all four patients with the middle term form of suspic@@ ion of more limited or no progress in cognitive development .
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ ological effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ automation schem@@ ata were conducted on the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minutes walking test . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously 100 e / kg of intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 e / kg of intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the Do@@ automation scheme with 200 e / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be present in patients who pose difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two Do@@ automation schem@@ ata is equal . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information , which will be available every year , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine is updated . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated previously , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously used other chem@@ otherap@@ ies as well as some therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta an Corti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fol@@ ate ( vitamin C ) and receiving inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition , before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( drug against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liqui@@ ds ( to remedy a liquid angel ) . &quot;

&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ared in its active form goes easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of medication by means of a longer time in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study to 456 patients who had not received any chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ national lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 7@@ 25 patients who had not received any chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;

&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , must be taken at least 5 cans of fol@@ ate and intake must be continued during the entire therap@@ ists and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after every third payment cycle .
&quot; in patients , the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , should be created before each gift a complete blood image , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ ism . &quot;
the al@@ kal@@ ische phosph@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anine @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dosage must take place under the rec@@ kl@@ ess of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the notes in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) &gt; C@@ TC degree 2 ble@@ eding .
&quot; patients should not develop @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity &gt; degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , must be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient has the value before the treatment

clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 year@@ - or in comparison to patients aged 65 years or above 65 years an increased risk assessment risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data to infin@@ ity and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials in clinical trials were necessary in patients with a credit @-@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , from &gt; 45 ml / min , no dosage adjustment needed to go beyond the dos@@ ed Dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ ations . &quot;
the data base in patients with a credit @-@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients were investigated with a liver dra@@ wer of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper b@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border @-@ value and / or Tran@@ sam@@ ase @-@ values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( at availability of liver recept@@ or ) not specifically examined in studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to the Kno@@ wing &apos;s supp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ jects may not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ atel@@ ic number can once again reached a value of &gt; 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ atel@@ ic number , thy@@ ro@@ ism and maximum @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
a reduction tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ th@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie has been be@@ amed when a pre @-@ treatment with fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; therefore , all patients must be instruc@@ ted with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 as a preventive measure to reduce treatment @-@ borne tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 up to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ logistic@@ s.com ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , avoiding treatment and min@@ il@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is required to take the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long semi @-@ value for at least 5 days prior to therapy , avoiding treatment and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , in which these events appeared , had appropriate risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ matur@@ ely hyper@@ tension or Diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid @-@ proof , a dra@@ inage collection in the trans@@ cellular space is supposed to be wei@@ gh@@ ed up before the pl@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ als , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally when this substance is usually administ@@ ered in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application atten@@ u@@ ded life @-@ oxid@@ ants ( except Gel@@ b@@ fi@@ eber , this vacc@@ ination is con@@ trained ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an irre@@ ver@@ sible sk@@ ul@@ sion of the reproductive @-@ ability is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be informed before the treatment - g@@ us@@ - to get advice on sperm production . &quot;
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) can result in high doses non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ logistic@@ s.com ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) to a reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed cont@@ ests with the result of a multip@@ lied rec@@ ess of side effects .

&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( watched by more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ bl@@ ous spots at after , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ de ) with Stu@@ h@@ lab@@ s , Stu@@ h@@ ld@@ st , fet@@ al / o@@ est@@ able secre@@ tion , slo@@ w@@ ary secre@@ tion ( wind ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( wind ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be applied in patients suffering from cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( to the prevention of organs of transpl@@ ant patients ) or with drugs such as war@@ ring in preventing blood cl@@ auses .
&quot; it must not be applied in addition to patients suffering from a long @-@ term painting syndrome ( where not enough nutrients from the diges@@ tive tract may suffer ) or at chol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
July 2007 the European Commission backed G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited filed an approval for the transport of Or@@ li@@ stat G@@ SK in the entire European Union .
&quot; alli is used to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I &gt; 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in combination with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; alli should not be applied by children and young people under 18 , there is not enough data on efficacy and security . &quot;
&quot; but since Or@@ li@@ stat is only minimal , but with el@@ der and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adaptation of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or any of the other components • simultaneous treatment with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Chron@@ icle Mal@@ absorbed • pregnancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • simultaneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ als anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence gast@@ ro@@ id symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase when alli is taken along with a fatty meal or fat diet .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can be introduced with improved metabo@@ lic control , patients should consult a doctor against diabetes before the beginning of a therapy with alli made a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic needs to be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; patients , the alli , as well as drugs against hyper@@ tension , or an increased cholesterol level , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ists if the dosage of these drugs must be adjusted . &quot;
it is recommended to meet additional pregnant measures to prevent the potential failure of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on inter@@ dependen@@ cies of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of Or@@ li@@ stat and Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in was observed an ab@@ duction of Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in @-@ plas@@ mas@@ egel .
&quot; when applying war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ c anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ li@@ stat , the Quick @-@ Values could be influenced ( international default Rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with Or@@ li@@ stat , the concentr@@ ations of the vitamins A , D , E , and K as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ins in norm@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be advised to take a compl@@ ementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vit@@ amine ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a single t@@ osis A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of volunteers , which were simultaneously observed by Or@@ li@@ stat , a slight decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on Plas@@ tic@@ on@@ centr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of Or@@ li@@ stat are mainly gast@@ ro@@ per@@ inal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medication by means absorption of un@@ bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ uter &apos;s side effects were obtained from clinical studies with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily .
&quot; the frequencies are as follows : very frequently ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( &gt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data does not fail ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of those side @-@ effects known after the launch of Or@@ li@@ stat has not been known , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a population . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli gains in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ uter side effects may lead .
individuals from 800 mg of Or@@ li@@ stat and multi @-@ d@@ ants of up to 400 mg three times a day were administ@@ ered over a period of 15 days to norm@@ alistic and overweight people , without a significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of the cases after the launch of Or@@ li@@ stat over@@ do@@ zation , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of Or@@ li@@ stat . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on human and animal may be trac@@ ed from a fast rede@@ em@@ ic system@@ ic effects that can be attributed to the li@@ ke@@ able qualities of Or@@ li@@ stat . &quot;
the therapeutic effect continues in the lum@@ ens of the Mag@@ ens and the upper intest@@ ine through kov@@ al@@ ente Bin@@ ding to the active Ser@@ ch @-@ Rest of the g@@ astr@@ al and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic lip@@ en .
&quot; from clinical studies was derived that 60 mg of Or@@ li@@ stat , three times daily , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fatty is blocked . &quot;
&quot; two double blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I &gt; 28 kg / m2 , the effectiveness of 60 mg Or@@ li@@ stat , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameters , the change of weight weights compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change of body weight in the degree program ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those courses that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction of 12 months has been observed , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the total cholester@@ in was with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg -@@ 2.@@ 4 % ( output rating 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output rating 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL cholesterol was associated with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg -@@ 3,5 % ( output value m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; in the wa@@ ist size , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.7 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) . &quot;
plas@@ ma centr@@ ations from not metabo@@ li@@ zed Or@@ li@@ stat were 8 hours after the or@@ atory gift of 360 mg Or@@ li@@ stat is not measurable ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy agents , which are powerful trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cis@@ pl@@ atin , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are ( like Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ ere , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of an Corti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended as for the effects in this age group is not enough information .
&quot; this means that the ingredient of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , prevent the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was examined in three major studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemical otherap@@ ies which are strong and moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .

the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi is applied to the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting which is in@@ duced by a strong em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy by adding one prior to the chemotherapy cor@@ ne@@ ster@@ oids .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on @-@ holder , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nest@@ y shelter or signs of a sub@@ acute emp@@ t@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable to extend with drugs from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T inter@@ v@@ all or with patients where the Q@@ t- Inter@@ v@@ all is extended or who tend to extend such an extender . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with a further chemotherapy medication , Alo@@ xi is intended to neither be used in the days after chemotherapy nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;

&quot; the aim of the study carried out for 221 healthy volunteers , was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ BC administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in sol@@ em@@ ony of 0,25 , 0,75 and 59 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows a slow Eli@@ mination from the body with an average termin@@ al half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum Plas@@ tic@@ on@@ cent@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration of concentr@@ ations ( AU@@ C0@@ - primarily ) are generally in the entire dosage range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans , was the average of 11 Ho@@ den@@ car@@ cin@@ oma patients between day 1 and Day 5 ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that once a daily use of 0,25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached on 3 consecutive days ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the entry of 0,75 mg higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated via the kid@@ neys and some additional 50 % are transformed into two primary met@@ as@@ ites which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies for Met@@ abol@@ ishment have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ en@@ is@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , as un@@ changing substance made about 40 % of the given dosage . &quot;
after a unique intraven@@ ous ab@@ usin@@ es@@ tion by healthy was the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although in patients with severe liver enzy@@ mes , termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ational @-@ time and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of dose is therefore non @-@ justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical trials , effects were observed only according to ex@@ positions which is considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 Off clinical studies took note that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only be blocking in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ channels that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ul@@ arization .
&quot; high cans of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose found in approximately the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure to people ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a multip@@ ly frequency of liver tum@@ ours , pit@@ uit@@ ary gland , pancre@@ atitis , pe@@ dic@@ ations and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for unique application , the relevance of these results is assessed as for human beings . &quot;

June 2006 the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expertise in which the approval of the approval for the transport of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C in the treatment of hepatitis C .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is similar to biological drugs called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same cell @-@ cutting @-@ efficient component , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; reference cells &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long prolonged ) hepatitis C ( one through an viral infection ) .
&quot; with a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissues points out damages , in addition , the values of the liver en@@ en@@ ame Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increased in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which an Gen ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the drug .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon set up data that occupy the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug ) , efficacy , safety and effectiveness at hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 455 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , as many patients were measured after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns were vo@@ iced that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which resulted in the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon and ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon flame re@@ tar@@ ded the disease in more patients than with the reference intake ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test was carried out in the study to examine the question , how the drug forms a immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins , against the drug ) , does not vali@@ dated sufficient vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it may be applied to the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cr@@ sten@@ ing in@@ tim@@ ated skin infection ) and small infected gl@@ ans ( cr@@ acking or bar@@ gain ) , di@@ ced and se@@ wn wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go is not supposed to be used to treat infections , det@@ ox or probably caused by meth@@ ane @-@ resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this kind of infections may not work . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , the skin surface must be no more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not speaking after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oma ( the parts of the bacterial cell that are produced proteins ) and inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indic@@ ator of the effectiveness was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was abbrevi@@ ated after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients among plac@@ ebo languages to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected front door , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ exin showed similar response : if the results of both studies were assembled at home users , talking about 90 % of the patients of both groups on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , found that Al@@ tar@@ go has been caused in the treatment of ab@@ st@@ aging ( eit@@ ed fluid spaces in body tissues ) or of infections that were veri@@ fiable or probably caused by MR@@ SA , are not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation to the client .
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) result in the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go outw@@ ei@@ gh the following super@@ ficial skin infections in the following super@@ ficial skin infections , • in@@ fied small la@@ vers , de@@ br@@ ced or se@@ wn wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; May 2007 , the European Commission shared the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. filed an approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union . &quot;
patients where no improvement can be examined within two to three days and should be considered to be considered and an alternative therapy into consideration ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be the treatment should be broken , the sal@@ be carefully off and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection can be started . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is not intended to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials with secondary open wound was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resist@@ ent St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient .
alternative treatment should be considered , if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected bodies occurs . &quot;
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plas@@ ma centr@@ ations , which were achieved in humans after top@@ ical use on de@@ di@@ ced skin or infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant Hem@@ ation in vi@@ vo not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After equal treatment of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) , and C@@ max to top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in sal@@ be on de@@ di@@ ced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low @-@ system exposure to top@@ ical use in patients Dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ ations cannot be held for , if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in during a system@@ ic treatment is applied with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a prec@@ arious eu@@ x@@ icity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
&quot; Ret@@ ri@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be should be applied only during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ted and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether the bull continues / termin@@ ated / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be ended , is considering the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials at 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most frequently reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the meeting place , which regarded approximately 1 % of the patient . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ri@@ am@@ ul@@ in is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of Pl@@ euro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ( formerly Pl@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ) . &quot;
the activ@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is based on selective im@@ itation of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a certain binary point of the underground @-@ unit of the bacter@@ i@@ ella Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differ from the bin@@ ess of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the Bin@@ ding place ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 are involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ ding place and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ Centre .
&quot; by Bin@@ ding at this binary point Pl@@ ates Pl@@ euro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , some partial P @-@ binary interactions and prevent the normal education active in ri@@ bos@@ om sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should be noted on the basis of the local prevalence of Resi@@ st@@ enz the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in at least some infectious forms , should be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the insul@@ ates are sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
in the case of an anti @-@ speaking on treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ one @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and on to@@ wed skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected wo@@ unds , single plas@@ map@@ ro@@ bes were obtained . &quot;
sampling took place on days 3 or 4 at adult patients in front of the medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system absorption on people after top@@ ical use of 1 % of sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP @-@ Hem@@ p . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in in human@@ ly liver micro@@ som@@ es , primarily has been convey@@ ed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral tox@@ icity to rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the approval for the transport system must ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ g@@ il@@ ance system , as is present in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application contract ( Version 6.@@ 2 ) and will work before the product is marketed , and as long as the product marketed . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the approval for the transport agreement is obliged to carry out more detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ovi@@ g@@ il@@ ance activities , as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( RMP ) and agreed in the module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application , as well as all additional updates of the RMP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for Medi@@ c@@ inal products for human use &quot; , &quot; the updated supplement will be submitted at the same time using the next peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report . &quot;
&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms in the treated place , you should finish the use of Al@@ tar@@ go and speak to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply other sal@@ ons , creams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface which is treated with Al@@ tar@@ go , if it is not explicitly chosen by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the sal@@ ds look out on one of these areas , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor about advice , if discomfort occur . &quot;
&quot; after raising the Sal@@ be you can cover the affected area with an ster@@ ile association or a Gaz@@ ever@@ band , unless your doctor has come to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic bag , which contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of sal@@ be , or in an aluminum bag , the 0,5 g Sal@@ be contains . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which concern the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not im@@ cour@@ aged against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be applied within two doses of the existing cur@@ riculum - whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vaccine can be managed from two doses into the end . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose of hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix may be given or another hepatitis C or B vaccine . &quot;
vaccines have an effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) as it can against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the Twin@@ rix vaccine since 1996 and the vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vaccines have applied to the protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adult and Twin@@ rix children are administ@@ ered within three doses of the existing cur@@ riculum . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult identical ingredients have been included , some of the data used by Twin@@ rix adult , also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indi@@ v@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine has been compared to a h@@ ub@@ on@@ ati@@ gen and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix carried out between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last inj@@ ections for the development of the former anti@@ body concentration against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix had at a distance between inj@@ ections and an 12 @-@ month intervals between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , appeti@@ te , pain at the injection , redness , mat@@ ernity ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission shared the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
&quot; the Stand@@ ardi@@ se plan for the pri@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administ@@ ered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her is desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines or with a combination @-@ simple vaccine . &quot;
working according to a Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation observed with the combination of anti @-@ hepatitis C ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - anti@@ body values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ arian vaccines .
&quot; it is not completely secured whether immun@@ om@@ competent persons who have addressed to an Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , a refres@@ her as protection may require , as they are also protected by the immun@@ ologic memory . &quot;
3 How to ensure all inj@@ ections for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine in the appropriate ways of medical treatment and monitoring are always available immediately .
&quot; if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ f@@ sch@@ ema is recommended with the drop @-@ down material , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface . &quot;
&quot; in Hä@@ modi@@ al patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , according to the pri@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ zation under circumstances , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ antibodies can be achieved , so in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required . &quot;
&quot; as an in@@ tra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a substantial imp@@ unity success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be in@@ duced sub@@ cut@@ out sub@@ cut@@ aneous since it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular hub . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix was administ@@ ered in the second half @-@ year in the form of a separate Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us sti@@ lt vaccine administ@@ ered , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective must be assumed that there may be no adequate immun@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , which was performed with 3 vacc@@ ination of this formulation by adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ologists , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ i@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the incidence , which has been observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccine . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 2029 vaccines have been administ@@ ered for a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ination at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses combination . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ozo@@ a on a calculation basis for the vaccine Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis for each person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the commission , compared to 39,@@ 1 % for the gift after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the commission , the Ambi@@ rix had administ@@ ered , about pain , against 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % in the proo@@ fre@@ es which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dosage combination . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ozo@@ a was comparable to each pro@@ band ( i.e. about the whole vaccine during 39,@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ b@@ anden , the Ambi@@ rix had compared with 36,@@ 2 % in the pros which received the 3 @-@ cans of combination . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ernity was low and comparable to which was observed after administration of the combination of combination @-@ vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses of the vaccine .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year Imp@@ fl@@ ingen , the occurrence of local and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that which has been observed with 360 ELISA units with 360 ELISA module form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface . &quot;
&quot; however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix had a common appearance of pain ( an injection point ) per dose , not a pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of imp@@ ed@@ ingen , which were considered serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses @-@ vaccines with Ambi@@ rix or during 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine schem@@ as with the combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis C , was statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , which were conducted at vacc@@ ination at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ converter rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 99@@ ,@@ 1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 administ@@ ered dosage ( d. h. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ tor rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administ@@ ered dosage ( i.e. , month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - up to 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combinations with three doses . &quot;
&quot; among the 28@@ 9 persons , their immun@@ ogen@@ icity was worth@@ less ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in 2 and 6 according to G@@ abe of the 3 @-@ Dos@@ en@@ im@@ pf@@ d significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical compar@@ ative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old a month after ending the full Lyme disease series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ination were either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B @-@ surface .

&quot; in this study the immune response against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that , following vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination simple , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical study at 12@@ - up to 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ antibodies are comparable to that in 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vaccine .

&quot; hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as bathing in water @-@ wat@@ ered waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark pri@@ st@@ ine , a blonde face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lo@@ id ) and other symptoms that may possibly take a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against an infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine has been completed with 2 cans . &quot;
if you are infected / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ ination Ambi@@ rix already infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel ) a vaccine may not prevent any disease .
&quot; protection against other infections , which are the liver inhi@@ bited or symptoms that are similar to those after an Hepatitis A@@ - or hepatitis B infection , can not be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express themselves by it@@ ching skin attacks , breathing or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever / has . &quot;
&quot; • If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the usually mentioned administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) . &quot;
in a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B with a reduced sal@@ ary component ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with decreased sal@@ ary of efficient components usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine prior to the end of the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will suffer from severe blood circulation , under the skin and not sw@@ apping into the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s own resistance , or if you / or your child can under@@ go a her@@ edit@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; ambient rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient , so a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Be your doctor if you have gotten further medicines / rede@@ em ( including those who have received no prescription ) or if you have received / your child recently vacc@@ inated / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( si@@ RNA ) have been administ@@ ered / or has planned this in the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
&quot; when another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limb@@ s as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women will not be administ@@ ered out unless it is urgent to vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
very common ( more than 1 case per 10 tri@@ pped cans ) : • pain or discomfort at the plate or redness • mat@@ in@@ ability • head@@ ache • Ap@@ peti@@ t@@ man@@ gel

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which has been known since issu@@ ing the initial approval for the transport , follow the CH@@ MP opinion that remains the benefit @-@ risk @-@ ratio for Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; however , ambient rix has been launched only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ compl@@ ett@@ em En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective or with hyper@@ op@@ ic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ak@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations ) in the pre@@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps is divided - split into several sol@@ dering to meals - sw@@ allowed , under the food mixed or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ eme ( by the abdom@@ en in the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) or a nose @-@ son@@ de ( through the nose in the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps were not compared to another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a hypo@@ critical medicine , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to loss of loss in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , flavors or taste , stomach pain , v@@ om@@ iting , v@@ om@@ iting , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , un@@ pleas@@ ing body weight or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) result in the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps is effectively prevented in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high payout percent@@ ages .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , as due to the rar@@ ity of the illness at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is indic@@ ted in all patients , where a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel is already manifest@@ ed in new@@ born child ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late t@@ amper@@ ed form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , which is manifest@@ ed after the first life of life , there is an indication for use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ esis is a hyper@@ op@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to sw@@ allow tablets or for patients with sleeping disorders is AM@@ MON@@ APS also in gran@@ ules . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of the protein @-@ toler@@ ance and development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as for consumption and adults . &quot;
in patients suffering from an early lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an argin@@ ine @-@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ APS tablets may not be administ@@ ered to patients with sl@@ ing disorders , as a risk for the emergence of eco @-@ soph@@ ie , if the tablets would not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MON@@ APS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , accordingly to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MON@@ APS should therefore be applied in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency as well as with so@@ dium and o@@ de@@ formation of clinical trials only with caution .
&quot; because Met@@ abol@@ ishment and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at over the liver and the kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ APS should be applied in patients with liver or kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency . &quot;
the meaning of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ dense ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous effects of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slo@@ ping of the neur@@ otic con@@ verse and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; it also found an ench@@ anted ri@@ pen@@ ing of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses , and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain , and thus a disability of brain growth . &quot;
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate will be retired upon people into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS during the lac@@ tation period is consistent ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ APS occurred at 56 % of patients at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MON@@ APS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able tox@@ ic@@ ative response to AM@@ MON@@ APS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ab@@ etic patient , which developed a metabo@@ lic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ ebox , heavy Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ emia , periph@@ ery N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred at a 5 month old small@@ child with a vers@@ ed single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limited neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabo@@ lic active connection , which conf@@ lic@@ ted by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is marked over the kid@@ neys . &quot;
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally observed phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with distur@@ b@@ ances of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for each gram it can be produced so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at between 0.12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival progn@@ osis and the clinical result .
&quot; the progn@@ osis of the early symptoms associated with appearance of the early symptoms during the new@@ born child was almost always infectious , and the disease itself led to treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ ck@@ free an@@ alogue within the first quarter of life . &quot;
&quot; by Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ se , the use of altern@@ ate ways of nit@@ rogen det@@ ectors ( so@@ dium meth@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ru@@ ding stress and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to diagnose the survival rate of re@@ born with post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life @-@ month ) diagnosed disease at 80 % . &quot;
patients diagnosed with patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which was already treated prior to the first appearance of a hyper@@ op@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many too spiritual disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
in patients with a late t@@ amper@@ ed form of the disease ( including female patients with the heter@@ ozy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase inhibit@@ ors ) that were treated by a hyper@@ op@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ duced diet was the survival rate 98 % .
existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at is ox@@ et@@ ected to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is produced in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with Glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine occurs . &quot;
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and his met@@ abol@@ ism in Plas@@ ma and Ur@@ in were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g so@@ dium hydro@@ chl@@ oric and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after lon@@ ged and repeti@@ tive gifts of up to 20 g / day selected ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ as@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous Gift of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
according to a or@@ al individual dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in tablet form were found 15 minutes after in@@ ges@@ tion plastic mac@@ ron@@ centr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ th@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ines or hem@@ ost@@ opath@@ ies , was after different doses Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) next morning , no Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at Plas@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; for three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single p@@ ants ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate @-@ concentration on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
exp@@ ul@@ sion The drug is executed within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ red product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing had so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses treated with toxic effects ( exam@@ ining 24 and 48 h after or@@ aler administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ APS gran@@ ul@@ at is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who can sw@@ allow any tablets , or patients with sil@@ u@@ cl@@ ing disorders ) , or over a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ at@@ l or a rhin@@ oc@@ eros . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day at new@@ born , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as for consumption and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , argin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , carnit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ ein in the plas@@ ma should be held within the normal division . &quot;
in patients suffering from an early lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ APS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
if R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes had been exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit by Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) there came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid of deer .
&quot; a prob@@ able tox@@ ic@@ ative response to AM@@ MON@@ APS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ab@@ etic patient , which developed a metabo@@ lic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ ebox , heavy Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ emia , periph@@ ery N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally observed phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore regarded as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be adopted that for each gram it can be produced so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ate between 0.12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ yl@@ meth@@ anol .
existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
according to a or@@ al individual dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were found 15 minutes after in@@ ges@@ tion plastic drugs of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; during the duration of the durability , the patient can retain the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; during this procedure , the small measurement of measurement was 0.95 g , the mean measurement of 2.9 g and the large measurement of 8,@@ 6 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication by a probe , AM@@ MON@@ APS , can be dis@@ solved in water before use also in water ( the sol@@ v@@ ility of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzy@@ mes , so that they can prevent the sti@@ ck@@ ness of proteins in the body after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if at your laboratory examination , you must inform the doctor that you may take AM@@ MON@@ APS , since so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; taking AM@@ MON@@ APS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken recently , even though it is not prescription drug . &quot;
during breast@@ feeding time you may not take AM@@ MON@@ APS because the drug could move into the breast milk and harm your baby .
&quot; in rare cases , Tur@@ b@@ ness , head@@ aches , flavors , rep@@ ay of the hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory , and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions have been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice one of these symptoms , you immediately sit down with your doctor or with the emergen@@ cies of your hospital , the introduction of a corresponding treatment in connection . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood sugar to the heart ) , for example , at inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; &quot; ( an anom@@ alies in electro@@ cardi@@ og@@ ram or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the prevention of blood cl@@ auses in patients which will apply to a PCI , a higher dose will be administ@@ ered and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; more than 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox has been compared with a gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ auses ) and a G@@ PI was compared . &quot;
&quot; during PCI the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a lock ) , and they received additionally other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ auses , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart accidents or audit@@ as@@ cular ) after 30 days and one year as effectively as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who subjected themselves to PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except in heavy blood vessels , where it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other st@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it should not be applied in patient , which recently had a blood circulation , as well as with people with strong hyper@@ tension or serious kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) at the end that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for Hep@@ arin is an unacceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin .
September 2004 the European Commission published The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd provided a licence for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for treating adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ lever in@@ far@@ ed ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) is provided with an emergency or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0,25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is conducted in a further sequence a PCI , an additional pin of 0.5 mg / kg and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the operation to 1,75 mg / kg / h will be increased . &quot;
after PCI needs the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a pin of 0.5 mg / kg shall be administ@@ ered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ oplast@@ y . &quot;
the recommended Dos@@ age of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI is made up of a initi@@ als of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation .
the safety and effectiveness of an all@@ u@@ pri@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
is this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to below 225 seconds should be shor@@ tened to a second bolt of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight .
&quot; in order to decrease the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ated and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before the use and the bol@@ th@@ osis rapidly administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose will be properly administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate Ni@@ eren@@ fun@@ ent@@ ance ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which will be subjected to PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,@@ 4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the ACT value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg to be administ@@ ered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with moderate low@@ cases , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study , the ACT was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds . &quot;

patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a ble@@ eding especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in PCI @-@ patients suffer from Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most ble@@ eding to arter@@ ial points , in patients suffering from a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment in principle everywhere ble@@ eding occur . &quot;

&quot; the Api@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the Api@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ ted ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ en , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm inj@@ ected or as a permanent inf@@ usion with a insul@@ in pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insul@@ in to control the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or process the insul@@ in cannot be effective .
&quot; insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs significantly from human@@ insul@@ in , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter work time has a short @-@ effective human@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in the application in combination with a long @-@ effective insul@@ in in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body can &apos;t produce insul@@ in in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; with type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body insul@@ in insul@@ in cannot be processed effectively , Api@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indi@@ v@@ ator for the effectiveness of the substance was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates , how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.7 % ( from 7.2 % to 7.2 % ) compared to a reduction of 0,@@ 14 % in insul@@ in @-@ is@@ pro . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration 12 % after six months with Api@@ dra compared to 0,30 % at human normal insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Api@@ dra may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of Api@@ dra must possibly be adjusted , when it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glu@@ cos@@ m levels . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission shared by San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a licence for the transport of Api@@ dra in the entire European Union .
&quot; the Api@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of the abdom@@ inal ceiling , the thi@@ ghs or Del@@ tam@@ us@@ k@@ els , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion into the area of the abdom@@ inal cord . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced gl@@ uc@@ ose capacity and the dimin@@ ished insul@@ in process , the insul@@ in need can be de@@ duc@@ ted in patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the brand ( sets ) , of insul@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ized , etc . ) , the type of insul@@ in ( animal insul@@ in ) and / or the manufacturer method can draw a change in the insul@@ in demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 A inadequate dosage or the break@@ up of a treatment , in particular in patients with a insul@@ in charge diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic l@@ eto@@ azi@@ ebox . these states are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insul@@ in type or insul@@ in in another manufacturer should take place under str@@ ingent medical supervision and may make a change in dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia is dependent on the effectiveness of the insul@@ in insul@@ in and can therefore change at the switch of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; among the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Conver@@ ting enzy@@ me ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , dis@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , fi@@ d@@ amin @-@ oxid@@ ant ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ ox@@ i@@ y@@ yll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s and Sul@@ fon@@ amid antibiotics . &quot;

severe hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ dem@@ ics with awareness can be dealt with using an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that are given by any trained person or by intraven@@ ous gift of gl@@ uc@@ ose by a doctor .
&quot; according to a gl@@ uc@@ ose object , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the original thing for the heavy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insul@@ in lo@@ wers the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the impact occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insul@@ in .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 @-@ diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus showed insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic range of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg and more dis@@ proportionate increase of the glu@@ cos@@ tical effect , just like human@@ insul@@ in . &quot;
insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as rapid efficiency as normal human@@ ism and achiev@@ es the full glu@@ cos@@ ity effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insul@@ in .
&quot; from the data was obvious that in an application of insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a compar@@ ative at least ran@@ ational gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with human norm@@ alities , which is 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine was placed in 2 minutes before the meal , a better socially ran@@ di@@ ale control than with human norm@@ alities was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control as with human norm@@ alities is given to the meal ( see figure 1 ) , is achieved . &quot;
