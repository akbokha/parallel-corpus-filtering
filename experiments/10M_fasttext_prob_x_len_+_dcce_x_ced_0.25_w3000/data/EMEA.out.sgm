<seg id="6">"Abilify is used to treat moderate-severe severe episodes, and to the prevention of manic episodes of patients who are addressed in the past in the drug."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when the oral ingestion of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution to one or the melting of tablets can be applied in patients using the slipping of tablets difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines, which are just like Abilify, should be adapted to the dose of bilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" "neurotransmitters", "i.e. chemical substances that facilitate the communication of nerve cells."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably appears above all as a "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also serotonin called).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in low degree as the neurotransmitters appears to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine can play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol helps to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and its reoccur."</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms was investigated in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficiency of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that compared to increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was tested over twelve weeks on 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that compared to increased unrest (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in symptoms of patients were examined by a standard scala in bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the company also led studies to examine, as the body takes the melting of melting chains and the solution to take resorbit."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with injection solution, patients showed Abilify in doses of 5mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significant reduction of the symptoms increased unrest than the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">When applying the bipolar disorder decreased in four of five short-term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Abilify therefore, up to 74 weeks, more effective than placebo the repetitions of the recurring episodes in previously treated patients and when it was in addition to an existing treatment administered."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased their unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the common side effects of Abilify to capture (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), extracting (uncontrollable), accreditation (instipation), saliva (increased saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, helplessness, insomnie (sleeping disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Humanveterinary medicines (CHMP) ended that the benefits of Abilify in treating schizophrenia, as well as in preventing a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes were talking to the treatment with Aripiprazol, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia, or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder, if a orale therapy is not suitable to weigh against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 the European Commission published Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a licence for the transport of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is for treatment of moderate to heavy manic episodes of the Bipolar-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients which had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes of treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended initial dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness of dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended initial dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar-I- disorder in patients &gt; 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient population, a lower Initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-Induector is set out of the combination therapy should the Aripiprazol dosage should be reduced to recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing a antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8). "</seg>
<seg id="36">"results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no shelter in patients with bipolar disorder, with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotic medication."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be applied with caution in patients with well-known cardiac disease, coronary heart disease, coronary heart disease, hypocracy, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure-pressure medicines or hypertension (including acute and maligne form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which performed a year or less, there were occasional reports on treatment with Aripiprazol emerging dyskinesia."</seg>

<seg id="48">"due to the primary impact of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with themselves overflowing side effects such as Secoding (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidine, a magussic acid blocker, reduces the resorming rate of Aripiprazol, whereby this effect is considered to be clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy probances a highly effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidin) was the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluid etine and paroxetine, similar effects have and therefore should be made similar tin reductions."</seg>
