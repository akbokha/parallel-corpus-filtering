package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select settings to set up .... open the card card tools and choose the desired modules .
&quot; this is a list with standard installation modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that possibly more modules are installed on your system , if you have any additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the k@@ ic@@ base , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras . then you can view the page , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to the crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if available , delete . &quot;
the Module An@@ gle filter ( also called folder filter ) you can reach in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s updated working directory on different types .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M building view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to view , choose Extr@@ as DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , example : the element , all the other knots are sub@@ elements of this root . &quot;
&quot; the module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type I@@ node / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views , in order to view the content of your local file system . &quot;
&quot; the partic@@ ular@@ ity of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists in it @-@ called folders using a so called Tree map . tree @-@ Maps allows the display of the size of objects in w@@ ax@@ ed structures . each object is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be recognized even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; &quot;
&quot; in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ screen display a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . for simpler navigation , the right corner will possess sensible colors and compl@@ ementary settings . &quot;
&quot; the colour of a rect@@ angle , which is switched on view color mode , can be either deep for the light detection of the sc@@ ach@@ ute or the figure of another file size as name , owner , group or m@@ ime type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature you can specify , if enough space to display exist , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angle is to appear ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; setting algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should normally be respected that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in Tre@@ ble in &amp; F@@ S@@ View , this target will not always be respected . note that the default entries are no longer available . note that less space for the frame is lost when the rect@@ angle square . &quot;
&quot; as spl@@ itting the area of a contract for subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to it . here it is necessary for the trou@@ bles@@ ome and avoidance of space cr@@ ates through frame , that rect@@ angle are emerging , which are as square as possible . the best methods of this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive lev@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal booked area for an entry over the menu entry view at the surface . instead , a rob@@ bed pattern is drawn into the area of the higher level agreement to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; as a little testing application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for use K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extr@@ as picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you call the module picture gallery , a dialogue opens with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to adjust to a text for@@ field to adjust the title of the picture gallery page .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a swi@@ vel to set the number of mini@@ ons each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the cross @-@ field fil@@ en@@ ame of the picture , you indicate whether the fil@@ en@@ ames will be displayed among the mini@@ figures in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ field file size of the picture , you indicate whether the file size is displayed among the mini@@ figures in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ field image size , you indicate whether the size of images below the mini @-@ image is displayed in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue folder , you define where the gallery will be stored and which sub@@ folder should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection , save in HTML @-@ file , where the HTML page is to be stored . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ border sub@@ folder , you can adjust with a sli@@ der or a swi@@ vel chair , up to which level the sub@@ folder will be included . &quot;
&quot; with the cross@@ bars , copy the original pictures to the gallery will be copied . &quot;
use the An@@ onym@@ z@@ feld commentary file you can specify a comm@@ ent@@ file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
&quot; in the cross @-@ cross @-@ field sel@@ ector , you can specify a different color sc@@ aling a different color depth than in the original pictures . &quot;

&quot; a simple to use camera interface will be provided to you with your digital camera , and you can download your photos directly in &amp; checking ; -@@ 1 . of course , each medium and any card les@@ er that is supported by your operating system with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; when checking ; contains a quick image processing with basic training tools . you can use these to view your photos , comment , evaluate and correct . the processing abilities can be easily expanded with KDE image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; checking came ; easy to use , it makes du@@ ous professional abilities available . it works completely at 16 @-@ bit color@@ br@@ aum and all available modules support the raw conver@@ gent means by li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC @-@ Manager management . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens , which can be looked for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; checking ; an open source project , which means it is dependent on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement . &quot;
&quot; check out ; tries to report the mil@@ king of problems or suggestions for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problem or wishes .... This opens a dialog with an under@@ line system . all required information is listed here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; there is a project that is supported by a community . that means that the user and developers got each other . if you are a regular user from &amp; Experience ; then , we would like to answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ tization . in this mailing list , however , we would like to reply to other users from our users . in this mailing list , however , you should not be able to answer any questions from other users . in this mailing list , you should be so powerful . &quot;
you can also check the check ; homepage visit to learn news about free releases and other information about &amp; checking ; to learn .
&quot; the best start to get involved &amp; checking , is the registration in the developer @-@ mailing list . guide to the registration in the developer @-@ mail list of &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; checking ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the folder symbol folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here the data collection is stored for all images . &quot;
later you can add so@@ many folder as you &apos;d like to add . &amp; checking ; will you use in addition as a library .
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can indicate the top folder , the pictures displayed , as a base folder . &amp; checking ; look at any sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the search of the folder you will get a progress view like this : &quot;
&quot; I came , dur@@ ital@@ ic@@ ated the libr@@ arian in its entire depth . you can not add sub @-@ folder , unless it came i@@ ste in hidden folder . this allows you to insert a point before the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folder , you will notice that the albums on My Al@@ ben@@ List do not take photos as symbols . you can change the albums by taking a popular photo from the album and use this on the folder symbol . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; checking ; your digital camera is set up . after that , you should learn how to use My albums and Pur@@ chase line to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw materials : in case you use the raw mode of your camera , so &amp; check out ; possibly also to deal with it . the support is based on the li@@ fel@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , so you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help file support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files in the sections of Ro@@ h de@@ coder settings and r@@ h @-@ work@@ flow .
&quot; a simple to use camera interface will be provided to you with your digital camera , and you can download your photos directly in &amp; checking ; -@@ 1 . of course , each medium and any card les@@ er that is supported by your operating system with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
modern digital cameras are applied by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transfer . the camera then appears as USB mass storage device . the interface can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may be used in conjunction with the seri@@ als port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; checking ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras , which has a constantly rising number of over 800 cameras supported . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a wide wi@@ dened protocol that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transfer of images of digital cameras to b@@ anners and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are large and transmis@@ sions about the seri@@ als port is slow . it supports these cameras and leads transfer of images using g@@ Photo@@ 2 through . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be created with li@@ bex@@ if support , so that the Th@@ umb@@ nails can be done reliably by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers , you might not need anything in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not want to go to lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
&quot; one of the most beautiful things to check out , is how simple to expand its functionality by modules : &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE image plug @-@ in Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; checking ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier to supplement &amp; checking ; through writing a small module to supplement it , when changes in &amp; checking came ; even to perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; the pull and drop of images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree @-@ tree , via the horizontal partition line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture does not lie in key@@ word , fil@@ en@@ list or addiction . &quot;
&quot; - a data @-@ selection allows you to extract the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields , which are currently displayed in the tool@@ view . thus , the fil@@ tering is shown on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind does not appear . which fields are shown can be configured in the dialog box settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; represents an organized view on your phot@@ al@@ ben . all photos that were saved by &amp; checking ; these albums can be stored on the folders , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date , on which the album was first created to be sorted . the date may be changed in the features of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have established a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into one album . you can also add a screenshot directly to one album . select &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from an album to another , you can move the photo with your mouse to the target album and drop it . you can select the same way several photos and copy it . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album includes a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to add information about this collection . to click on the album properties , you must click on the album with right mouse button and select in the context menu album properties . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can select among a common name . selecting albums sort by collection . if you want to add new collections or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album starts : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sort by date sort by .
&quot; the buttons el@@ ester , average , new : these set the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF data . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first came up an album in &amp; checking ; open , the first image in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative , and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select a different photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and read in the context menu &amp; quot ; As the album &quot; &quot; kick @-@ off &quot; &quot; select . in addition , you can draw the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be wast@@ ed .
&amp; Pres@@ sure came ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My sampling list on the main window . album collections have another effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album is displayed in the window window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of these advantages with the two l@@ ump removal in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time you are ready to wait , while the Th@@ umb@@ nails will be generated . this can be avoided in which you can create new advantages in the menu Extr@@ as . &quot;
&quot; information on any image will be displayed below the preview . what information is , you can set up using settings ; set up the albums page and adjust your way to your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the Th@@ umb@@ nails have help patterns , appearing . if you give the mouse over a moment to rest . the Help shows the most important features , including all the keywords of a photo . the screenshot is shown above in the section introduction to the main window , shows such an assistant pattern . &quot;
photos are all what came to live with &amp; checking ; walks . albums and tags allow you to organise your pictures as you like . you can reach all the functions that come with &amp; checking ; possible using the context menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you have the choice between viewing the images , a sli@@ deshow or editing of images . &quot;
you can open the editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Picture Edit@@ ing ... or the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button and edit ... editing a guide you can edit a guide you can edit your photos and edit them .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; checking came ; the functionality you need , not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the menu menu with the right mouse button . for this , and how you can adjust this to your needs , if your program is not en@@ umer@@ ated , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that it may come after processing by other educational programs for problems with the associated met@@ ad@@ ata met@@ ad@@ ata . some programs do not store these data using the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , bl@@ ending etc . &quot;
&quot; when checking , there are two ways to turn@@ around . the simpl@@ est is to click on the preview and select rotating . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the P@@ review and select F@@ 2 Re@@ name from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you came a photo out &amp; checking , delete it in the M@@ ül@@ men of &amp; k@@ de ; postp@@ oned it . f@@ 8 picture Del@@ ete or Ent@@ f If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by adding Shift . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos from the data . &amp; checking came ; uses either the EX@@ IF @-@ Date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et below in the dat@@ ashe@@ et , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful opportunity to organize your photos and assigned to catalog . tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to the individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word can be assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this sample or a search again . &quot;
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all photos that have been marked with this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also arrange your tags log@@ ically . you can also connect parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling kits , so you can find the Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : you can find the keywords that you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords will be stored in a database for quick access and stated key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also re @-@ imported your tags in other programs as soon as checking came ; the pictures are noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new tags by clicking on &amp; quot ; My sampling room , or on an existing key@@ word , and then select a new key@@ word , after you click on an existing key@@ word , this becomes the password of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word using the right mouse button . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a sampling by moving it to the desired location in the tree and drop it there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to shift the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be one time in the tree .
you can change the characteristics of a sampling by clicking it with the right mouse button and select in the context menu key@@ word . you can change the name of the sample and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu . in addition , you can draw the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to bed &amp; checking ; s functionality using sampling handle , you must first select your photos with keywords , you can first click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling room . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the advantages of the pictures and select from the context menu key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be shown once you choose one of the keywords for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was done etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with sampling , this under the preview of the picture is displayed in the main window . &quot;
you can remove a key@@ word in which you click with the right mouse button of the photo menu and select from the keywords @-@ menu de@@ activation . the menu only shows you the tags you have assigned to the photo .
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time depending on the number of images per unit . a selection frame can be moved across this hist@@ og@@ ram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the subject of the drop @-@ frame , which indicates the tim@@ eline . this will all be shown in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this then appears in the list below .

&quot; it came ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorith@@ m . these allows to compare these sig@@ natur@@ es . the lower the difference between two inter@@ sig@@ natur@@ es , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each image to find a similar one . by using a s@@ ell@@ erts the result selection can be increased or desp@@ ised . if you move a picture from somewhere on the symbol of the insufficient search in the left side@@ bar then you will open it and you can drop it there .
sketch : open @-@ hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and bed . here you can find the right pictures . also here a pig value can be set .
this rider presents a intui@@ tional search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ Program . you can push the mouse bike in or out zo@@ oming and move . move it while you are fil@@ tered with a square . all pictures inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this is ahead of course that your images may contain ge@@ o data .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . he works like a live Geo@@ ord@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; Set up ; puts a lumin@@ ous in a separate window at your disposal with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported images formats , also in raw files . &quot;
choose one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em lumin@@ osity added from the context menu . the selection is added to the ligh@@ tening window and its window are opened ; main window are you can open the bul@@ ls quickly with L extras .
&quot; from the pre @-@ umb@@ bar you can see the pictures you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window . if you can preview synchron@@ ize your copy of the tool@@ bar and zoo or sho@@ ots in one of the images , then you can compare the same section of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to copy quickly from a picture series . if you are using pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the fields to compare it . the right neighboring picture is displayed in the right section . this is simplified it is simplified through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal li@@ ars also work directly from the bul@@ es like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
&quot; all pictures from the right side bar of the main window are available for both preliminary pictures in the lumin@@ osity . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each section you will find a built @-@ in swing function , which you find at the crossed pil@@ es . to keep the visible area of the picture . in the mode preview , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the z@@ oom @-@ regul@@ ator among the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel around in The image into and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures when you are preview in the mode .
&quot; what is a digital component - away from the fashion word ? digital survey , consider each part of the process of following after the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos take up , sc@@ ans or digital photos stores a form of digital component . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , find , protect and use photos . we look at the procedure for digital photography the &amp; checking came ; we consider the downloading , ren@@ dering , evaluate , evaluate , up@@ loading , secure , waiting and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; digital survey is based on , indic@@ ted , categ@@ orized , ass@@ ures , is trans@@ forms , conf@@ ection@@ ate and ex@@ porting content that is a mon@@ ary or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data via data . met@@ ad@@ ata are designed in accordance with your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data that can be managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1,000 photos on your computer , then you do not even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you &apos;ll definitely use not &amp; checking ; . the approach the met@@ ad@@ ata can be stored in a database as well as into image files . if you cannot access the met@@ ad@@ ata for you with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know before you need any thing into your system is to store information structure in contrast to data structure . you need to decide whether other access to your photos should be saved , or on a network running station &amp; etc ; bew@@ are that you have to change on a larger drive sometime . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . accommodations can be found quickly over your location . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub @-@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant assignment of images to different subjects and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % working files will not be able to organise your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the stack easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the option met@@ ad@@ ata to save in the setup page of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; checking ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file , then you can subsequently save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the item &apos;s menu item . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change ? this puts &amp; checking ; to them a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work , since you can now use any photo keywords , lab@@ eling and a review . of course , you can select all the images that you need the same attribute and start the value . it makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now take the key@@ word , keywords , as you can frequently use other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
if you import kat@@ alog@@ ised pictures from another source with embedded sampling ; then the re@@ sort of Hier@@ archy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by moving a sub @-@ tree on another . the changed key@@ word are made by &amp; checking ; updated while the sub@@ trees are tr@@ acked .
&quot; the graph shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata can be over@@ cut . this is a very cru@@ de representation , since every block of met@@ ad@@ ata is made in truth of many sections . data names and cal@@ ender dates for all pictures . &quot;
&quot; enough the keywords , the next section relate to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want to see most nobody to see your photos just , you want to share it with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details to see people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . Wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical time span is present , you might even hear the silence of this panor@@ amas completely . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . remember that the key is the importance to the viewer to help Him over the motive which she moved , what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only with a cap@@ tion for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; checking came ; you can export any number of text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling you can use it for a selection of images simultaneously . KDE is able to tell you for a selection of images simultaneously . KDE released the story to tell your wishes in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web gall@@ eri@@ es@@ ystem . you will have to tell the story for the opening ceremony no second time . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find yourself into a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities offered the ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation are already unt@@ am@@ able and will be repeated in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your trips through images with geographical indications . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; copy@@ left is a word play with copyright and describes the practice to use the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the furniture page of &amp; checking came ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creators and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer of the photographer , for example , if the name of a company or organization has been saved , it should not be changed anymore . this field does not support neither mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on as divi@@ der . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for editor ) : associated with the author . examples of this field contains the work record of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as : employed photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent Phot@@ ographic photographer . &quot;
editor ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider to identify who is offering . this does not necessarily be the author . if the photographer does not necessarily know the image . if the picture is a stock photo . if the picture is a stock photo . if the picture is a stock photo .
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this does not provide protection against abuse . each of which a little more than basic knowledge in work with calcul@@ ator can delete or change . the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and half @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique in each image . &amp; checking , will provide such a module for for@@ kli@@ fts in the near future . &quot;
&quot; topics : PL@@ AT@@ TEN@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , plate @-@ loss , ECC , transmission errors , aging the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , vitality , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that could happen on the road or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen in traditional paper photographs or negative . in this section it concerns problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data re@@ organization of the world , has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated for longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in Archi@@ ving . of course , you can also claim CDs and DVDs in archives . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it lies in your discretion . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be read un@@ read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk in which you store good dis@@ ks and good recording . the best DVD cav@@ ity are not much more reliable than the cheapest but you write a lot reliable . it &apos;s about to select the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to error , even if you have just been written only . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ atting and the check@@ sum . despite this massive protection of the control we needed for the form@@ atting , ul@@ avi@@ olet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ bu@@ ster the apparently miracle to CDs and DVDs . it works under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there are similar applications that dis@@ rupted data from damaged dis@@ ks , HDDs , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray dis@@ cs appear to gain the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything related to CDs and DVDs was also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; burn slowly with a good cav@@ ity on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . read then , read the media using a description , date &amp; author labels and afterwards to a clean , dark drying and above animals protected place . do not forget the data to read the next generation of hardware and software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; Disk@@ manufacturers reserve your statistics for itself . your manufac@@ tor will include a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disk drives : discre@@ pan@@ cies study . &quot;
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks keep on the longest if you are operated in the temper@@ ing range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . some of S@@ MAR@@ T fixed bugs announce the immediate im@@ case . some of S@@ MAR@@ T fixed bugs announce the most likely im@@ print . however , the expected lifetime time period is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only about the complete ver@@ loss due to over@@ load . of course , you can also retri@@ eve data loss due to an electricity if you have secured files , but these losses can usually be made without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices are not much comp@@ uted , with devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors , these can cause heavy damage . on your computer you can cause these anom@@ alies , complete data loss , hardware design , non @-@ destructive mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the in@@ avo@@ ids that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against electricity tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that part of the energy mix absorbed and the rest is ground@@ ed . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar , but remember that not any plug @-@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protection against light@@ ning bolt and thus protect the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; since a over@@ load of any cable can use any cable to your computer , you should pay attention to all the periph@@ er@@ als that are connected to your system . some manufacturers face over@@ voltage transfer for your mo@@ dem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial mo@@ wers of cable mode@@ ms and TV . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you &apos;ll need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the mo@@ dem . so you are ideal for traveling . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ stress protection your system will protect your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a fragile free power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection against over@@ tension , these devices can automatically make cordless energy available when a black@@ out occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system to run smoothly . in addition , if you buy a US@@ V . in addition , the life time of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concerns the potential risk , which your computer system is exposed and compare your safety in power disorders with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ stress protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you are thinking of less than just a euro . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go to holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration , you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can save any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; they are very expensive compared to the HDDs , however , very expensive - 40 GB costs EUR dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general security solution . &quot;
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online store services . your free memory is available to 1 GB . the professional version provides you with more information in the event of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for 25 $ per year you will get unlimited memory that should be checked in reality only . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data protection , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically calculated and included in the large companies is included in the offer a backup and a distribution store . with this they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ sure . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all transmis@@ sions are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs make sure that the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst thing is that no one is telling you when a transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ b@@ ances remain un@@ discovered until you have no shelter in your computer . nobody seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data base than that in your computer .
&quot; un@@ reliable nets are another source of transmission lu@@ cr@@ ust , since they produce interactions within the data flow . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
Z@@ FS by Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle on low level and can be highly scal@@ able with many patches and is available under one of the GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that there is soon also for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in alpha @-@ status . it is still using the same protective mechanism that is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data ver@@ lu@@ ste at not@@ ebook and 46 % in job systems . when not@@ ebooks are already the proportion of theft 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the most common ones . it leads to a lesser damage , such as theft or new@@ install@@ ment ; and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple @-@ users know only very few viruses and under Linux ; it has long been no longer seen . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss as proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travel F@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the broad@@ cast@@ ed file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investig@@ ator process during a surgery is higher and an in@@ defined status will be avoided . if a file was not completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the major causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical borders . it is meant that technology continues to develop a natural border to these progress . sensitivity and smoking characteristics , for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border . &quot;
&quot; today cameras go in the direction of the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras , and high quality optics are the optimum for comp@@ ak@@ t@@ cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard@@ disk is available today for 100 &amp; euro , so do not take anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the rein@@ stall of your operating system , exchange of sheets or the size change of hard disk drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make daily your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash suggests you are lucky when the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot . forget aircraft : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , deser@@ tion always means a local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as above already is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files is to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot of two time points : to the complete assurance and the last difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files which have been changed since the last backup . produces several moments when such a backup has been made . this backup comes to a version@@ ing system along the next with the exception that it is just off and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer copies r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this is com@@ pressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
secure important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to DVD or another op@@ tic medium .
&quot; this approach gives you enough time to discover losses and restore it . at the same time , you come to backup with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end , you have a complete daily release of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . any other di@@ lu@@ tion should happen manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; met@@ ad@@ ata : met@@ ad@@ ata related to IP@@ TC information , association X@@ MP files , original reserve memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ viewing images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; in order to survive valuable images the next 40 year , that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you , because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be taken into account : &quot;
&quot; because the future due to your nature is un@@ predic@@ table , you must consider everything which today is said to be careful and re @-@ rate during the time . unfortunately , there is no other possibility than a certain vig@@ il@@ ance in the past . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easily it is the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered on the basis of declar@@ ations in this document . use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to reading your images then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and back@@ technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means more and more .
let &apos;s suppose you have planned the scal@@ ability with one planned and have placed the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not depend on it . &quot;
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc # source is / dev / s@@ dc / dev / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; b ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ mb@@ h if needed
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be made from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that is slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was designed to replace an open source standard of GI@@ F . however , it can be much more . it is able to store X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Metad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . P@@ NG may require Gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ st data for improved color information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F . this format we would like to recommend you to save your images . &quot;
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ com@@ pressed form or in a container with a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free com@@ pres@@ et algorithms ( defects ) . a problem is however that this format is adapted by many people . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The digital negative file format is a licensed and open pipe format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is committed to the use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a handful of camera equipment is now available and we hope to use the competitors for Canon and Nikon as well .
&quot; this is probably one of the reasons why , in order to replace Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with enlargement &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored the for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer a original of your recording , mostly in the raw file , archi@@ ved . X@@ MP doesn &apos;t care because it saves the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the file file . therefore , you can consider whether you use DN@@ G as container and put it all together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , working in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and awareness efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the ticket les@@ er or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera &apos;s camera you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your pipe archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a complex process you can use external programs . if you came the pictures again with &amp; checking ; edit , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these have been cut down from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , ko@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; checking ; in the section adding a photo to an album , you can add a description of how you have photos , which you already have on your hard disk , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your destination database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; checking ; to use , connect these with the calcul@@ ator , turn the camera to the ad mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , this tries to connect to your camera . in some cameras that is made a while . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for the file order is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information to each entry . with the side @-@ side features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or his met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photographic information that is stored internally by the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata like video , manufac@@ tor , GPS etc . this information is the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata @-@ side@@ bar out of the main window of &amp; checking ; or the editing process . please note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available at some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button download and then download the pictures from your camera to a single album in &amp; checking ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired with the standard op@@ tionally method of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you choose the photos , use the button download and then choose chosen . the button selected is out as long as you have chosen some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is supported this , an option is new to download . these pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; checking ; downloaded . in this case the new pictures were downloaded with a star in front of the for@@ er@@ up@@ ster . if you choose this option , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you use the buttons All download or use selected , appears a dialog with which you can click the target album . the list of existing albums will be sorted , like normal folder , you can read in Section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after which you have chosen the target album , you press OK , and &amp; checking ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all at once by delet@@ ing the button Del@@ ete . if you just want to delete some , so you need to select this first and delete deleted . &quot;
note that there is no possibility to restore photographs that you have deleted from the camera to restore it . so you should check carefully if the photos are successful into a &amp; checking ; if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete the camera game as this is much faster .
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are often used as a fil@@ en@@ ame name . the fil@@ en@@ ames will normally be upgraded after the photos from the camera are deleted . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options on the rotating and mirror of the image and for dat@@ ums@@ archiv . if you use this the latter option , a folder is automatically created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options during the transfer opens three more options to be performed before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the text information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
if you want to add another file format than the default format you can use B. in the editing field the pre@@ fix Photo@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn the option date &amp; time . for further adapt@@ ations you should read the help of the instruction str@@ f@@ time .
&quot; if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you will have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small case letters . or in case letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which came &amp; checking ; for a photo is used , below the name shown below , the camera is displayed in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame is saved and automatically used if you open the next time the camera pattern . &quot;
&quot; you can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time of recording . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic turn@@ out is usually switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , leave &amp; checking ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic turn@@ out , use the button Advanced and select the Autom@@ atic la@@ undering in the lower part of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera has been made information about the date , where the photo has been made available , can &amp; check out ; this under@@ carriage are based on image data . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you may read , which information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case saves &amp; checking ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use this option to switch . use the button @-@ based r@@ al@@ ben at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos from your computer to your camera is the button download . select then upload . the file op@@ tionally dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that will be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de methods ;
&quot; after the photo selection is done , asks &amp; checking ; you where the pictures should be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to boot the upload . the pictures are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position which is indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tudes and which can be shown on a map . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it may be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to create an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo has been made , you can view a postcard to another &amp; check that the area shows . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; checking ; user want to locate the location of the photos so it is good to match the position of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data in the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as the direction , saddle and maps text files , then there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files , using the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; so far as we know , there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit . however , there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as a card module or through transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;

downloading the GPS data from one device can be stored with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you need to store these data in g@@ p@@ x format since this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that extract data from pictures and from GPS . on the following page you can get the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the badge coordinates , e.g. from map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ googl@@ e.com shows no European stre@@ et@@ ches . here are some European sites , at least in french , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; and checking ; try to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many attitudes which came into account settings ; set up on these settings , set up in eight pages . you can switch between these options by clicking on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; select action can display in built @-@ in preview , or image editing . you therefore set the default behavior of &amp; checking ; fixed when you click on an entry in the top view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ denti@@ ty and the legal data . these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected for download from the camera interface . even with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author is a syn@@ onym for editor : this field should contain the professional photographer of the photographer . these can be design@@ ations such as an employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . &quot;
editor is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to enter the photo . this does not have to be the author if this for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the image is a stock photo then the group or agency should be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . it is achieved that the met@@ ad@@ ata are constantly contained in the image and not just arrived in the database of &amp; checking ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; checking ; imported without lost .
&quot; illustrated cap@@ tions as built @-@ in cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JP@@ EG images store : this synchron@@ izes the comments you have to add to your photos , with the pictures embedded in pictures , these may already be read by other images , these are over@@ written by the types of digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information that appear if the mouse c@@ ursor in the main window over a file rests . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&amp; # 160 ; Pres@@ sure came ; supports a number of different types formats and some video and audio formats ; to indicate which data types &amp; checking came ; indicate which file extensions came and remove . Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner that has no such enh@@ ancements to come from &amp; checking ; ignored .
default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update right of each category .
&quot; however , the settings of the lumin@@ aire of &amp; checking came ; can then open on this page to the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can only get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default the sculp@@ ting uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different colour , you can switch it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ lined sections of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright color in the picture . these colors will be specified here . in the editing process , this analog mode can be reached with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images can be coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information , please read this article in Wikipedia about the closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the adjustment P@@ NG com@@ pression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this surgery does not reduce the image quality , since P@@ NG used a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free algorith@@ m . the only effect is that the image data is more time for initial and un@@ zip . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value on a high com@@ pression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high com@@ pression . &quot;
with the option T@@ IF@@ F files com@@ press you can switch to the Def@@ late -@@ com@@ pres@@ et algorithms for T@@ IF@@ F pictures . it reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F pictures . it has no effect on the picture quality as the defect @-@ algorith@@ m ver@@ able works .
&quot; with the setting of loss @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can use lu@@ st@@ free . even if you have written the loss of file size , the relationship between quality loss and file size was written far better than with the normal JP@@ EG . as this paragraph , met@@ ad@@ ata were not supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; checking , the image processing was only a picture @-@ displayed for photos . currently , it quickly developed to a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default feature is that all green pixels are equal . if the ger@@ ad@@ orable green pixel of the C@@ CD sensors , this difference creates a little soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with minimal loss of details . this option draws the picture a little soft , eliminated , but the 2x@@ 2 G@@ ail@@ mu@@ ster with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD @-@ quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the white @-@ comparison of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Autom@@ atic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white @-@ fold is not set . standard is it a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . the advantage of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ lined images in four steps will get more details in the pick@@ ups . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is it the wei@@ gh@@ tening , so the parts of your images are burned out , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to catch the nickname . finally , use the c@@ lich@@ ter in various ros@@ at@@ balls . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the con@@ fer@@ til@@ ation . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast s@@ ati@@ le as green and red . &amp; check out ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still non @-@ saturated blue pixel . of course this is a question how much color or white you want .
&quot; when you select the option , you will get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each image individually . &quot;
Set the l@@ umin@@ ance according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; checking ; -@@ image editing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should take conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing -@@ algorith@@ m is a digital image process to calculate with a complete image of the partial raw data sensor to which many cameras have and which is a matrix colorful Pixel available . this algorith@@ m is also known as CF@@ A @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w also came up to you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it was created . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m that was created by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates colour coding on the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colour@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour correction , since you will be carried out during the raw conver@@ gence . &quot;
&quot; a profile translated the colour information and gives instructions how this should be returned . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; checking ; information like the color formations of a Far@@ br@@ aum into the other , so that the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
behavior Ques@@ tions if an image will be opened in the image editing module with pipe files .
color profile folder S@@ aid here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; checking ; investig@@ ates this folder then during Star@@ ts . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have the opportunity &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to store . everything can be changed while opening the raw file later .
the Col@@ ors view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should be used to the camera manufacturers and model that you do . not all profiles are created in the same way . currently there are some examples such as Canon that does not have any color mapping or Gam@@ mak@@ es@@ hap@@ ing . currently corrected d@@ cra@@ w gam@@ ble not for con@@ versions at 16 bit of depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
&quot; there are other options like the soft @-@ proof profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how to print your image of a device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer can have a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated with you , rather than to rely on the blin@@ ks of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is pretty obvious which color profile is provided with them for what is intended . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that suit together . this answer is of course in@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension makes the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; pictures of image , and image containers ; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you &apos;ll see a list of available modules . select the item you want , and these are then downloaded from &amp; digi@@ tization . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ command for tasks that are performed by modules , can be set in the menu under settings short commands . &quot;
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the upper shelves should be easy to understand . the upper shelves should be easy to understand the time between the images , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other cross @-@ cross fields turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata or off which appears at the bottom of the pictures throughout the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show a list of all the supported cameras on the left . on the right top there is a button automatic detection , which is trying to connect to the computer . currently , if you want to utilize this , you are here Seri@@ elle , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage devices . this field will only be active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage in the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / remo@@ vable re@@ indicate where you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; checking ; to use , you need to connect the camera with your computer , put them in the display mode . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ bi@@ ere you out whether &amp; checking came ; the camera automatically det@@ ects ; if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you set your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here . &quot;
with the option confir@@ ming dialog for rel@@ oc@@ ating pictures in the M@@ ül@@ men view you can adjust the inter@@ pol@@ arity of &amp; checking ; when delet@@ ing a photo in an album . in the sections delet@@ ing a photo and delete an album you will find further details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be silent through &amp; checking ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side bar without back@@ queries . otherwise you will need to apply changes with the button changes .
you can also tie the display of the welcome panel of &amp; digi@@ tization ; at the starting hand . this acceler@@ ates the starting process of &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation .
&quot; the setting Bei@@ m start looking for new photos , and check out ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos came up ; this extended the starting time of &amp; checking ; if something out of the base folder was deleted , you ask if it is to delete them from the base . &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be found in &amp; checking ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can select you under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs is shown below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; checking , please find more information about it in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; Pres@@ sure came ; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correction and improvement . the image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button of the preview and selection of entry indicators / editing .
the imaging processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; checking ; so you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the image processing .
&quot; a stat@@ line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar on the upper edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the editing process change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have file save or the button store from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
so you should possibly be able to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file save time .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by adding the menu file re @-@ manufacture or the button of the button rein@@ deer in the tool@@ box . you then lose any change that you have performed on the photo since the last time . &quot;
&quot; virtually any action of the image processing can be und@@ el@@ ted or recovered . the last action you can und@@ o , by selecting Edit@@ ing back@@ packs or restored , selecting editing re@@ produce from the menu . &quot;
&quot; when you use this frequently , you should make up the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to back@@ wards and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to re @-@ establish . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the &amp; L@@ MB ; about the repe@@ ating or re @-@ establish button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer press , you will receive a context menu . if you choose one of the menu items , all actions in between also un@@ und@@ ated or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the editing process , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navig@@ ational buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image down or the entries in the menu file , you are asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can start in the photo and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the tool@@ bar menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically select &quot;
&quot; view Full mode shows the photo in full mode . you come to the normal view , where you do not want to use the bar button . normally , you can view this in the setup dialog of &amp; checking ; you can call it out of the &amp; check ; main window . see the section for setting up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print in the menu file image and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole phrases . whole picture pictures can select from your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard method and select from the menu album ex@@ porting printing assistance . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need your choice to meet . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and promotions for the selected pictures . the same page bar is available , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multi @-@ roof Click on the same rider leaves the side@@ bar appear or back into the edge disappear .
&quot; in the marking view , you can type or insert signs with unlimited size . note that the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . that means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support ASC@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC trading field in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after which you have commented , you can use either the button or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the use @-@ button , there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also use the met@@ ad@@ ata in the files . however , this will always be conducted if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata settings that is always written into the images . &quot;
the section rating displays a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in addiction and sor@@ ting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cuts . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously and use the context menu .
the review is written in the IP@@ TC field pattern . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the sampling review shows a search box to fil@@ tering the keywords , the key@@ ing tree and a selection box with the previously contained in this &amp; checking ; -@@ session requested key@@ word . &quot;
the sampling tree is adapted dynam@@ ically to the given search word . you can restrict the number of possibilities in finding a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is another relief in the input of sampling at a picture series . if you have different key@@ word entered , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
key@@ word can also be stored by selecting the corresponding check@@ boxes in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC @-@ field key@@ word .
&quot; when multiple images are selected in the main view , and select a key@@ word in the sampling tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not on the entire selection , If you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling record is used to change the selection of the displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar with their album , - fil@@ en@@ - , key@@ word and search views . if in addition , one or more key@@ word filter is displayed on the right . all created sampling are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop them . suppose you have selected several images in the top view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put it on the selection . then , a dialogue is asking if you want to set the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example the main window shows the pictures at a calendar day . the sampling filter is reduced to no keywords , which was chosen by Str@@ g + a . they were drawn with Str@@ g + a , and then a key@@ word dates back to the right and put it there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes will take place at each start of the program . it can also be switched to settings in different settings .
&quot; if you have a rule and have created , and determine that there is one or be , you can easily change this with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry that is sought after in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can specify a Exten@@ ded search for all elements of the database using the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the cross @-@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I found it mainly on &amp; checking ; s made concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why one uses a color @-@ managed work@@ flow is that the colors available from your camera or scanner , you can reach that the colors available on your monitor from your camera or scanner , and that the colors you print or publish on the web that you have to print out of your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the subject comes to color administration , everybody wants to know which buttons it must push for the results that he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to give you adequate background information about color administration . in addition , you will find links with deeper information allowing you to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired outcome . &quot;
&quot; if your photo work@@ flow meets all six below criteria , then you do not need to worry about color administration . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum . ( further information can be found below )
&quot; your only other images submitted by E @-@ Mail or the Web , where s@@ R@@ GB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you use another color foam and make it possible to worry about color @-@ managed . &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we really can see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ stle @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms so visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click on Info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to put my monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ ghter if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum or not , you have to work your monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ ghter since s@@ R@@ GB doesn &apos;t have to work out the circle . if you are working as in the Far@@ br@@ aum of s@@ R@@ GB , you must either use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , picking up the same and contrast of the menu Rev@@ ised Autom@@ atic correction automatically try out of your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see which best in your photo works . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize the lumin@@ osity over the entire image , so the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ gh@@ est point is as bright as possible without its color sh@@ ady . this feature is often a mag@@ ician correction for pictures that are dark or balanced . &quot;
&quot; the same : this method is the illumin@@ ative of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ og@@ ram of the Inten@@ sity text is as flat as possible . sometimes , the results achieved very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces only gar@@ bage . it is a very powerful operation that causes either a picture or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automatic de@@ equal : this method maxim@@ ises the color area in the red , green and blue canal . you determine the dark and bright border @-@ tones and j@@ us@@ hes the red , green and blue channels on the whole hist@@ o@@ grams . &quot;
contrast bro@@ ws : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by the shift the lowest and highest values in between all levels in between . this is only visible in a balanced picture and can be a good correction for bad photos .
white comparison of &amp; checking came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ comparison of a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ fold correction is slightly limited as possible over a Far@@ br@@ aum with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can do so far from the original image , in case you can perform white comparison in raw mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correc@@ ting correction is better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white @-@ hydr@@ ated algorithms , protected by P@@ aw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it over the menu entry colors white @-@ like of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the preview can be adapted to the size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target image . the P@@ review will see dynam@@ ically the settings of the tool . if you want to watch the original white comparison , it is enough to click on the under@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pixel under this mark@@ er is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ ram .
&quot; on the right above is a hist@@ og@@ ram displayed that is dynam@@ ically changed once you have a parameter . this hist@@ og@@ ram is very helpful da , even in well illuminated images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow &apos;s shadow lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also rep@@ utable . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature @-@ pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the pictures to select selected colors for the calculation of the colour temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white comparison with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ loaded indic@@ t@@ ator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will see the combined result in the white window . this is displayed in the preview as r@@ an indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
&quot; the buttons save as and loading exactly this . every setting of the white equ@@ als you have set , you can save it into a text file and later load again . &quot;
the button pres@@ ets sets all the fil@@ tering values back to their default values and the associated @-@ neutral white balance . take note that also neutral settings will be shown as your original . if you save this entry your original image will be changed .
&quot; you can adjust here the co@@ di@@ sti@@ cs per colour channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ coding is better for high @-@ quality pictures . this coding is also required for high @-@ quality pictures . this coding is also needed for top quality P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialogue as to the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color pro@@ files . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the hel@@ mets . a det@@ a@@ illed manual for the use of color pro@@ files , you can also draw the chapter of colours . &quot;
&quot; another important tool is to be found in the menu under colors key factor . this tool provides an integrated way to store multiple colors channels , so you can also use your settings to use them . this is helpful when your camera or your scanner always need the same mistake and you can always find the same correction . in the manual on the sound correction , you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; to correct a very powerful possibility of loading problems , the tool for gr@@ ad@@ ation is that you can find under colors gr@@ ad@@ ation in the menu . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; tool color effects puts you four color effects , a solar panel , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and a cant@@ een filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was solar , also Sab@@ ati@@ er called , an effect that was created when one developed a partially developed pressure from a short light@@ speed . it had the effect that the lighter areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted through the second light . the result was a di@@ so@@ fter neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to see this interesting effect fine . &quot;
the intensity controls the solar isation . at about 50 % intensity the image shows what chem@@ ically is possible . another increase creates a negative image that is not to be created on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar system . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter si@@ mu@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contr@@ asting effect of the colors brilliant and smooth . try it simple , he em@@ bell@@ ished many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name optimized for one on day@@ light . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for his smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color , but also some photographs , especially those of the most beautiful landscapes . &quot;
&quot; the Ne@@ on@@ filter is simul@@ ated Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . with great pictures , the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual you want to correct the color contr@@ asting and the lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can watch experimenting with the various coloured codes of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are happy with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse issue : one to great satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness will reduce the satur@@ ation instead of raising it . all changes that you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool Gr@@ ad@@ ation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound@@ proo@@ fing to improve the exposure . even if the dialog on this tool appears very complicated , you need only the area of the sli@@ der . more substanti@@ ate the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ o@@ grams . &quot;
&quot; the window includes a graph of intensity , a hist@@ og@@ ram , of active channel or selected area . under the graphs are three sli@@ der to change in , and which can be moved to change the intensity of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to use it is the regul@@ ator to move and take care of how the image changes .
&quot; on the right side , the original and the preview of the picture can be seen . preview is dynamic , updated by the settings of the picture , updated . on the left are the following options available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ og@@ ram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis is often portr@@ ayed the linear hist@@ og@@ ram by a single pillar . in this case the linear hist@@ og@@ ram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic use is beneficial .
&quot; three Reg@@ ul@@ ators : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often gam@@ ma@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; the three colour@@ ing chains can be used in the preview of the original image to j@@ us@@ hed the input values , middle and bright notes automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
issu@@ ing values : the output values enable the selection of manual values for every area . there are also two controllers that can be used to modify the output values interactive as with the input values . the com@@ pression of output values can be used e.g. to create something else in the foreground .
&quot; automatically : with this button the picture values are automatically placed depending on the intensity of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : using these buttons , the integrated values in the file system can be saved and later loaded . in addition , Gimp levels will be used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three paint chains , the input values automatically displays for all shadows , resources and sun notes . activate the color pi@@ ps which you want to use and click on the original image to set the input values for red , green , blue and the l@@ umin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ load In@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels , to view over@@ se@@ ated pixels and view the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview , and it is no effect in the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original is displayed and the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modifications channel : this sel@@ box allows the channel to enter the channel by the module :
&quot; besides this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a broad beam . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode is continuing . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move for example a short rope to the right , for example the bright notes , then you can see that these bright notes are corresponding with a dark sp@@ ouses and that will be the associated sculp@@ tor dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; preview the original photos is a red mark@@ ings to see . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the area you want to change , a suitable line on the curve is displayed . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is up@@ ted to your taste . &quot;
save as and store : using these buttons you can make exactly this . any curve you created this can be saved in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp Kur@@ ven@@ format .
&quot; if you want this method and the three paint spra@@ ying buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sunny . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want and click on the original image to set the score for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ load In@@ k@@ ator controls all shades , in order to over@@ load pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . here is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview , and there is no effect in the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photo which has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance canal . shadow and solar panel was applied to the cur@@ ves and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of &amp; checking came ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color grad@@ ations of the photo .
the channel mix@@ er is another high @-@ developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of the image processing .
&quot; using the channel op@@ tionally , you can select the color for the hist@@ og@@ ram account : this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the original section of the window can show you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ ram to show you the appropriate color value .
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ators for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels , as the channel mix@@ er then retain the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient , as you can also reduce the appropriate color components . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a colour comes to a visible smoking , which consists of small spac@@ ef@@ acts which does not occur at the same point in the shade of the colour . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the bul@@ let first . &quot;
saving and loading buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any mix@@ er setting can save you for later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp channel Mix@@ er format .
&quot; the option over@@ load In@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels , to view over@@ se@@ ated pixels and view the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview , and it is no effect in the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue canal was re@@ constructed . the option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ actions . with the development of digital photography is black / White a work@@ step because color pictures simply can be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ bars .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film bel@@ at@@ ering with a green belt filter . this looks good , with all scenarios , and fits particularly well to portraits against heaven . so similar to the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Grün@@ filter . &quot;
Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter : simul@@ ates a black / white film animated with an or@@ derly wind @-@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film animated with a red cherry filter . this creates a dramatic pole effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ ts@@ z@@ enen to the day @-@ time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) rot@@ ect .
Gel@@ b@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film animated with a yellow liner filter . this is the most natural dy@@ ton@@ ing and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium t@@ ints while he adds a bit col@@ dness in the chicken and the re @-@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; checking ; tool texture you can use decorative textures to a picture .
&quot; by adding an texture to your picture , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop type portrait from enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall . the menu entry can be used texture of image processing can be used for it . &quot;
rel@@ ief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper textures is shown on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; checking ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . to retain its attention it is a psychological barrier to stream . this is a psychological barrier for the stream eye . under the frame the module can be started from the editing process .
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired menu type for your picture . consistent with a thin line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounded it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button @-@ p@@ ect and decorative adds a zi@@ pper with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value area for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for print the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert simple one @-@ format text into a picture at any place . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text box and place it with your mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color room and the character set with its characteristics as you need . you &apos;ll simply select a frame round the text and / or a semi @-@ cau@@ tious background . already , the picture is ready . &quot;
&quot; each setting that you have chosen for your text , can change until you click on the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the picture has been saved , the text is part of the image . he can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; checking , tool sten@@ cil , you can put a sten@@ cil over an image . &quot;
the menu image template uses in image editing can be used to put them via a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , if you want to add the P@@ NG file format and should add with maximum com@@ pression ( 9 ) to trans@@ forming the file size of the sten@@ cil . if you want to add your sten@@ cil to the &amp; digi@@ tization ; mail@@ ing@@ list : entered @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button @-@ base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you are copied for the template into the folder . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder was set for the sten@@ cils , a building view that reflects the folder structure of the pattern . the selection of a folder is updated automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the enlargement factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button is magni@@ fied the fine image . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
twi@@ sts : this button res@@ ized the below image . it is c@@ ited around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture . check out the image accordingly . please check it with the left mouse button .
move this button to move the image below the pattern . take the picture and place it at the desired location .
use OK when you want to apply the sten@@ cil to your picture . the image will then be adapted to the default size .
&amp; checking came ; provides three different tools to fur@@ nace . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for fur@@ n@@ aces . it is very fast and simple , but produced especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined images . &quot;
Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make an image shar@@ per . in fact it is not a bit like it works rather psych@@ ov@@ is@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to take a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken out of Gimp and he is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
&quot; re@@ vocation is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters to adjust . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digit@@ alization process need to be put together with minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras do normally require more consistent shar@@ pen@@ ing as normal cameras for private use . &quot;
&quot; with JP@@ EG pictures , there is often a camera to have been applied . pictures in the raw format , on the other hand , always must be shar@@ pen@@ ed during the processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner apply a sharp@@ ness already during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able this de@@ activate , you get the control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by setting up a photo with the fur@@ nace menu . you can call it with the menu entry for correc@@ ting shots . &quot;
&quot; they should hereby be careful , as the results will not be very natural : the fur@@ n@@ aces increased the sharp@@ ness of the edges . in general , the consumer &apos;s bar@@ b@@ ust technique is increasing . you can get further information about the menu entry into correc@@ ting re@@ vocation . below re@@ vocation you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to fur@@ n@@ aces . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : one image is too cr@@ ack@@ y . the solution to draw the picture a little soft . use the tool for soft@@ ness with the menu entry cor@@ rigi@@ d sof@@ tening and experiment something with settings . the curtains on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter is bl@@ ur@@ red . a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview can help editing the image . it shows the current edition of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should first try out the effect . if you create in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing mask , smoke and the impression of atro@@ cities in the vicinity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius is like many pixels on each side of a canal which are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ ators . therefore they should be able to raise images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red image one which is added to the original . thus the strength of the har@@ ness is set .
&quot; the sw@@ amp is a rup@@ ture from the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference difference . one can thereby define a minimum difference between the killing of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ es except and hence beauty error in faces , He@@ aven@@ ly and water @-@ surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ quer@@ ade filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a spon@@ ge = 0.0 . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; tool re@@ vocation , focused on a picture by improving the har@@ p . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted de@@ hydr@@ ation filter -@@ algorith@@ m from Ernst Li@@ ppe . &quot;
this tool tries an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ us@@ sing . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ k the photo . it &apos;s a better approach than just trying to mask the photo . it is using a technique named F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . it is using a technique named F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . you can start using a technique named F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . you can start it from the menu by getting color Ref@@ us@@ cs in the editing process .
&quot; in practice the circular lo@@ wers works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which depends far from the original pixel , which is widely influenced by the original pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen F@@ altung is influenced even very strongly from the remote pixel . it causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the main parameter for the use of this module . for most images the default value should arise . you can put a higher value when your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red , but then on Heiligen@@ str@@ aps . &quot;
cor@@ relation : an increase in the cor@@ relation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the cor@@ relation can be selected by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.95 and on . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ly effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the smo@@ k@@ filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0,1 is rarely helpful . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the smoke @-@ filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . an appropriate value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will continue the image even further . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe . in most cases , you should use this value on 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you may also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ h@@ filters . &quot;
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ Size : this value determines the size of the Transform@@ ation@@ sm@@ at@@ rix . however please note that the module is very slow when you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the pal@@ ate . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving and loading buttons are exactly used for that purpose . any re@@ cl@@ us@@ tic parameters you have set is set for later and can be loaded for later .
&quot; try all the cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image before you change the picture . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible but later left untreated art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; to read and com@@ press images , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ com@@ pressed picture . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mask produce better results as scar@@ fs . this could be caused by doing the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ quer@@ ade a larger neighborhood as sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; theoretically . even under optimal conditions it has to produce radi@@ cal@@ ming increasingly arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it is never possible to indicate the effect of the F@@ IR filter . practical , the result of the F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different fil@@ tering , on a small un@@ focused image , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture that has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto @-@ focus Lin@@ se .
&quot; for more information on the methods to complain in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
&quot; the Reg@@ er Gl@@ ät@@ te sets the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of the area , to generate a natural pesti@@ cides . &quot;
&quot; the colour tin@@ te allows a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes rather than dark ones , then you can set this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tool to un@@ cover the desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorith@@ m was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to edit the filter settings of fine j@@ us@@ cs , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail@@ ing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a little value leads to an even more homogen@@ eous more than the image . a value of 0.01 should keep details so necessary . please note that the detail@@ ing is always subordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; strai@@ ghtness Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es even@@ ly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you create a film @-@ like pattern . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ed &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum gli@@ ding factor above all@@ ab@@ norm@@ p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value to the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher the value is set , the more it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;@@ Tur@@ bul@@ enz@@ y effect it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : returns how often the algorith@@ m is going through . normally here is 1 or 2 .
&quot; Win@@ kel@@ watt page da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : Win@@ kel@@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if it is small chosen , it should also be small for a long run . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integr@@ als Gra@@ tw@@ side &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : integral st@@ ep@@ width of pixel . you should avoid the value of small 1 , to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never bigger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the More of quality you get through the choice of this option is minimal . he doubled but the run@@ time . we recommend it to it .
&quot; the buttons save as and loading exactly this . each setting of image error can hereby fix it into a text file , and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; image error is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and take a high CPU load on it . you can therefore ab@@ ort the calculation at any time with the button de@@ duc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; below you can see how image error can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is placed on a photo that was made in Guatemala city with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see , there is a peculi@@ ar black arti@@ facts taken during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; checking came ; Rau@@ sch@@ reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce sculp@@ tors . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filter , to remove spots and other arti@@ facts that may come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ tin ; effects of recorded images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information on digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screenshot is shown above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gr@@ ind noise which can be successful with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the under@@ window details and the under@@ window advanced settings can stay with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius is controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can limit the image into it and the color in it is checked and thus cleared up smaller errors . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ st@@ ness . this value puts the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ yss which faces the filter to the front . if it is lifted up , the adap@@ ters filters can change the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details do not receive more and smo@@ ker or lubric@@ ate again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the cant@@ onal accuracy of the filter . if it is too strong , the frequency response from the filter . if it is too strong , the entire smo@@ k@@ ets can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a little noise , or JP@@ EG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the details controlled by the details .
color : controls the color @-@ toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the details controlled by the details .
Gamma : controls the gam@@ ma intoler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas which are typically stronger in@@ smo@@ ked to increase . he also spar@@ ked the shadow areas too .
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the adju@@ sting of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter absorption . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ aire . when it comes to high , the edges and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter occur at the edges . he can remove pre@@ dat@@ akes and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for smoking reduction , which you have set , can be saved into the file system and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how smokers should change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive with ( 2 ) , which has been applied with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; sometimes a picture is too scar@@ ed for your purpose . the solution to mark the picture a little soft , is fortunately much easier than one image to exc@@ el sof@@ tening and experiment with the glasses . the curtains on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; checking came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce phot@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter to restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts of your pictures . it is very well adapted to dive Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ Hô@@ tes , scrat@@ ches , com@@ pression mode and local fau@@ lts in the picture con@@ tours and thereby gets the content as it does the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the algorith@@ m can be used for color and textures . the Tex@@ process for restoration was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ ent , and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the com@@ pression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as an embarrass@@ ed com@@ pression mode , he creates a few com@@ pression @-@ pressing image ; - small standards which can be seen in un@@ com@@ pressed picture . this option is to correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons Save as and store exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later loaded .
&quot; photo restau@@ ration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and take a high CPU load on it . you can therefore de@@ vise the calculation at any time with the button &quot;
below you can reduce as a photo with equ@@ itable sound@@ ing . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO was recorded . you can see the in@@ famous film base on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that was applied with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts marked by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; tool hot@@ pixel allows the hot@@ pixel photos that have been designed with a C@@ CD camera , eight were taken to remove . it uses algorithms of the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , tot@@ e or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras have with JP@@ EG com@@ pression over a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; is Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pixels &quot; &quot; ; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the button dark . the tool becomes automatic the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the imaging show .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can take the dark picture directly into the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel through C@@ CD Def@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correc@@ tive image . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and this automatically invites them into the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview support you within the picture to correct the result . the curtains shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all previous areas .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to cross this pix@@ el@@ bl@@ xes . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ ing : it becomes an average of the neighbour pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately to the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels which have a distance from 1 of the pix@@ el@@ block to be drag@@ ged to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear pixel . these are then used to cross the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ tering method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square cur@@ ves ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves .
Cub@@ an : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be de@@ duc@@ ted to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ ic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of wine cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to cross the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long si@@ pping , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; Vign@@ et@@ ting Cor@@ rection is a tool for correc@@ ting the vig@@ il@@ ting , i.e. subordin@@ ate corners , an image to correct . &quot;
&quot; for@@ win@@ kel@@ etal objective , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the whole range of sensors . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) them reduce the corners and edges of the picture by putting the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many centers filter need one factor 1,5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . for@@ angle lenses should use an aper@@ ture filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ per effects caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large lining areas of today &apos;s film cameras and colours scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ filter by a qui@@ val@@ atory transformation in a raw image that is applied without this filter . the algorith@@ m is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by John Walker . &quot;
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vig@@ or filter and with three more the exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light increases at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , what a optical filter with a aper@@ ture adjustment of 1 , or random@@ ly of a light intensity of 2 , per@@ me@@ able increase the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ il@@ ess , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and Gamma settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you must re@@ connect the lining of the target image with these options , as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
if you want a subtle re @-@ loop of the target image so let the values for lumin@@ osity / double / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gr@@ ad@@ ation from the &amp; digi@@ tization . image processing from the menu Color Gr@@ ad@@ ation .
this is an example of the vig@@ et@@ ting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ et@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous correction is also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; checking came ; Lin@@ sen@@ ver@@ ings is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical l@@ enti@@ ls on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dis@@ rup@@ tions . colored distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second ridge treats the general geomet@@ rical inter@@ ruption of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ form form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third crest has a similar effect , but in the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth Gr@@ ades corrected the remote corners towards the second ridge . if you combine these two can be virtually eliminated each geomet@@ ric version .
&quot; generally , this value controls the strength of the second Gr@@ ades . with negative values , tonn@@ age can be corrected , and positive values of kis@@ sed distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth Gr@@ ades . this value works stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Cor@@ ners have changed the sign of the parameter . &quot;
z@@ oom : this value scal@@ ded the image size and thus leads to the correction of the first dit@@ ades through . negative values increase during positive the image .
&quot; bright : this value ends the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image , will be stored and used at the next start as default values . &quot;
the tonn@@ - or kis@@ sed correction should be performed in front of all cuts or sizes . at the best run this correction as any of the first . in case you re@@ ap a picture and then carry a tonn@@ y correction would be the effect of the wrong .
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool displays a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in connection , you can correct the tonn@@ age / kis@@ ses with the help of the lines . &quot;
if you want to correct a kis@@ sed distor@@ tion the resulting picture black corners . you can transform these with the cutting tool in the menu to cut out the image processing or via the z@@ oom regul@@ ator of this dialogue .
&quot; for most images , the tonn@@ y correction is made . the next logical step for some motives such as shots from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees . please note that if you have the camera with your hand , you will always have an easy understanding of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tonn@@ y correction to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorith@@ m is based on a method to simul@@ ate infr@@ a film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org website created under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ h ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this movie has an sensitivity of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters set film bas@@ ins and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option add to film gr@@ itt and the domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows will know how snow !
&quot; since the filter channels have been mis@@ used for the production of infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel does not make sense the effect on black / white photos , as the color formations are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ ared camera . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the original image below ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the top @-@ light .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter film gr@@ itt is a simple to use tool to reproduce film base on your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed rail , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to increase the sensitivity of films , the manufacturer of large silver @-@ cells of the photo em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film base effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from daily life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the body is calibr@@ ated . the default value is needed , although frequently higher values need to be adjusted , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more bodies , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film poster on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the user @-@ powered film @-@ hyper@@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; checking came ; filter oil paintings created the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a common legal algorith@@ m by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; checking came ; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature and breast@@ feeding are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to affect this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five out . th@@ icker brush are better for big pictures . smooth brush , the smooth@@ es are controlled or , from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the original is marked with the ( 2 ) . Pin@@ sel@@ dom for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient in order to create a carbon@@ ate in the drawing . pictures whose gra@@ dient could change slowly , so if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper Reg@@ ul@@ ators cho@@ oses the engra@@ vings and the lower j@@ us@@ hes the contrast ( glass ) .
this is an example of the coher@@ ent filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result may be further improved by adapting the intensity .
the &amp; checking came ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stopped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , spher@@ ical landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows it to adjust the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of distor@@ tion se@@ aling . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; wav@@ ef@@ xes 1 : divide the image into cells , and makes it look as if it is seen through glass blocks . &quot;
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to the wav@@ e@@ blocks 1 is distor@@ ted the image here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time for calculation and create a high CPU load . you can ab@@ ort these effects anytime with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work using Un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : caught the picture along stern@@ tu@@ alized lines created by a centre . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ pen@@ ing a zo@@ om@@ inal camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in the sports photography .
radi@@ al in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ness : caught the picture by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ pen@@ ing of a revol@@ ting camera .
remo@@ vable w@@ ish@@ ness : caught the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back in the background .
&quot; movement @-@ bl@@ az@@ ing : caught the image by horizontal moves of pixels . this simul@@ ates the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a linear movements , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
soft@@ ness Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : caught the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright notes . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and sh@@ iny soft @-@ effects ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
ch@@ ills : wi@@ red the image by random variation of the pixels and simul@@ ates the shar@@ pen@@ ing of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent intoler@@ ance : finds the color @-@ bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ ped them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and created it then , through feeding with an average pix@@ el@@ value , new . &quot;
&quot; some effects need a long time for calculation and create a high CPU load . you can therefore de@@ vise this calculation at any time with the button &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; button . &quot;
the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es are a nice small tool to make shelves to your picture . this gives it natural your images a pair of appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m .
tro@@ pe size allows the size of drops to change . since the tro@@ pe size does not automatically increase the size of the image . number changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the op@@ tic effect of drops on the picture .
&quot; you can hold with the &amp; checking ; image processing an area free of rain drops . use the tool to choose the area , e.g. a face , which shall be free to stay . if you run the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ y , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of rain drops . the original image ( 1 ) shows a peaceful sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example . &quot;
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or rotating in the right orientation . these tools can be transformed in the menu transform or transform the mir@@ rors . &quot;
photo blo@@ wing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is simple . the big question is , how can you drop a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorith@@ m that is used here , try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . select the size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size changes a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to f@@ ade . &quot;
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation for example sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; checking ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m photo was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher the value is set , the more it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &quot; van Gogh &quot; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effects , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons Save as and loading are used precisely for this . every single device for photo , can be saved as text file and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; photo blo@@ wing is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a very long time and drag a high CPU load . you can ab@@ ort the calculation at any time with the button &quot;
&quot; you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles below , adding a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) is the result of linear standard enlar@@ ging the comparison . &quot;
&quot; cutting of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture . the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; once you get rid of the mouse button , the area of the photo will cut off the way . you can change a good overview as your photo to cut off . you can create the size of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle create you by clicking on the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut @-@ cut , use the button @-@ button of the blade in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file save or file saving in the menu file to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the pros range , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format the larger value of height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is al@@ located . &quot;
&quot; the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use Cen@@ timeter , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for Fot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to extract the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; below in dialog , you can set up the area with the Max . Rati@@ o the area to the cutting upon the maximum possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cut aspect ratio saves its settings depending on picture orientation ( horizont@@ ally or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tools the next time , these settings are displayed as standard value depending on the orientation . the changed image measurements are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of mer@@ ging aid enable assistance to help you to better put your pictures better . these help are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic bat@@ ches are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third el@@ reg@@ el , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are an opportunity to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles on the di@@ agon@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Golden Middle : the golden middle is a partition that is on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us Musch@@ el , or the Bl@@ ender leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden partition is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used for the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to make your temple and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects used the Golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i eps . 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . from where every number after 1 is equal to the sum of its two numbers . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is as follows is regarded as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the golden center is available liquid support lines if you put an image down . these help are raised down :
&quot; the Golden spiral spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third el@@ reg@@ el , the golden spiral establishes a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the spect@@ ator along the line of the spiral , and creates a symmet@@ rical visual river . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rect@@ angle of golden spiral , also called Golden rectangular angles . it should give something that the eye is at the center of the composition . it should be a line or different objects . this can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles are also leading from the upper parts of the golden spiral . take note of the middle points of the golden tri@@ angles . note that in contrast to the harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ ale to place these lines can be a st@@ ati@@ ful object dynam@@ ical . &quot;
&quot; when you use Golden Tri@@ angles to break your frame , create a effect of a professional photographers . try to place your images on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve different . &quot;
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al mirror and Ver@@ tical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ious dough .
&quot; with the button of color , you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to turn an image at any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you &apos;re the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates an image in which things around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; checking ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select to transform your free rotation , and j@@ us@@ ite the target corner . &quot;
&quot; turning your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are set in degrees . with the button Settings , you can put the sli@@ der back on 0 degrees . a preview of the image is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the Module Free Rot@@ ation represents a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse button in the pictures to position the two lines . now , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ sing the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have filmed an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix it , it is the function trans@@ forming to use the image processing . &quot;
&quot; an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . select one of the following options : &quot;
&quot; the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing is smooth@@ ed the picture a bit after the rotation . however , take note of the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ ulative transform@@ ations are performed by a fix@@ ation of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialogue , you will find some information which can help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that have emerged through the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas that have emerged through the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
angle from the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the trans@@ former area .
angle right at the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right of the trans@@ former area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the trans@@ former area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ former area .
&quot; after the adaptation of the perspective the picture will be a bit wast@@ ed . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after which you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ joy@@ ous tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to ber@@ some is to cut the image with trans@@ forming out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the moul@@ ding tool is used to move a part of the image into a direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal figure for example , the picture is distor@@ ted . with other words , a rect@@ angle is moved into a parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . you can start this module via trans@@ forming sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
drag your picture by using the Horiz@@ ont@@ al angle and the vertical angle . you can horizontal and ver@@ tically at the same time . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the view@@ points .
&quot; to your help , a vertical and horizontal line will end . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool @-@ tool to j@@ us your picture . &quot;
&quot; after you have performed the shr@@ ink , the picture will be a bit wi@@ ped out . for a single loop this effect is often neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots are twice as much sor@@ ting and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after shr@@ inking the picture has a beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is to cut the picture with transform the image processing out of the image processing .
&quot; when it came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write formats . these available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the type as these libraries were comp@@ elled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; checking ; &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all files available on their system . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F . &quot;
&quot; check out ; shows only files in formats , which knows . this happens on the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can modify this list of file extensions . you can modify this list of file extensions ; in the section configuration you will find more information . &quot;
virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to find the format used . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; checking out ; supports both formats .
graphical com@@ pression is the application of data com@@ pression to digital images . they are redund@@ ant information to save in this way the image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . generally there are better , gl@@ atter@@ proof results as JP@@ EG with the same com@@ pression relationship . the 200@@ 0s can also store lu@@ st@@ less if it is stated in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read in Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions inside English . you can convert raw format images in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw converter of &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; checking ; &quot;

&quot; if you share the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do good when the initi@@ ale contrast already was very good , then you can perform the first four corners with the Module White . &quot;
many tools you need the photo processing are included in &amp; checking ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; all imaging tools such as grin@@ ding , smo@@ ked , smo@@ ked , bl@@ ur , bl@@ ur , bl@@ ur , bl@@ ur@@ ging , bl@@ ur@@ red , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ den@@ quot ; in this dialogue : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress beam shows the status of the filter on the current image . left of him allow five buttons to change the way mode of the for@@ e@@ field . these modes are :
vertical sharing without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the range right of the selected range .
horizont@@ ally split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected template area .
vertical . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal section . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the layout , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and sub@@ str@@ ations . the colors used can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the preview . you can see this frame with the mouse within the picture and drop it on the part of the picture by which you can preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings vary from the last use of the module .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the chosen image and is largely explained itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters at the shoot of the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider presents a intui@@ tional search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ Program . you can push the mouse bike in or out zo@@ oming and move . move it while you are fil@@ tered with a square . all pictures inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this is ahead of course that your images may contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ et files . the application can be used to manipul@@ ate color pal@@ ettes and to choose and use of colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can either be installed for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and load @-@ used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog range , you can choose from a list of pall@@ ets installed or browse the folder to files . &quot;
the c@@ ursor is displayed in the pall@@ et view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the color beside it . the color is described below the pall@@ et view . here the color name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the c@@ ursor there . then move the mouse at penet@@ rated lin@@ ker mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the An@@ cross field Bei@@ m c@@ ursor under the button add color is inserted , the color is inserted from the color board on c@@ ursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ written . this mode can set you by selecting the cross @-@ line crossing under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as in the last section , can work together with the actions copying , cut and inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a po@@ len@@ ght sign , it can be added as one color in &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; inserted . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then you can find in the color select on the left .
&quot; graph@@ ite programs ; is a KDE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs are free layout programs . graphs are available in science , especially in inform@@ atics . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program to visu@@ alize graph@@ ite &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; the graphic viewer ; project has set itself the goal to replace these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de program .
&quot; &amp; graphi@@ cally ; is a KDE program for the spect@@ ator of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs are free layout programs . &amp; the graphic viewer : displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI , . it has the following functions : &quot;
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graphs in &amp; Kate ; the graphs are updated and in &amp; na@@ graphi@@ viewer ; )
&quot; menu , to open the graphs in &amp; Kate , or to open the graphs in &amp; Cas@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in one &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
loading of large graphs ( currently there are problems of about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knots )
&quot; other needed software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of graphs is required . required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the open graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; graphi@@ cally ; without an argument , the main window will be empty as in the bottom of the screenshot . in this case , the tool@@ bar will only open the icon and the ( empty ) list registered files . click on the first icon to view the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more or dot @-@ dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screenshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the character . you can select a fixed position of this review or select this item automatically . &quot;
&quot; the mouse wheel use ( high and down without speci@@ als , left and right at penet@@ rated &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file is just listed in &amp; graphic , loaded file from another program , the following window is displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph will be re @-@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change , so you want to change the change as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open an Graph@@ ite outside a running &amp; k@@ graphical user ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; graphical graphs in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change them with the dialog dialog . &quot;
&quot; in the program start , you can open all the graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify how the graph is to be divided into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely . &quot;
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs that are to be installed on a page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective sections of the graph . &quot;
&quot; page @-@ Show with one on several pages distributed , without head@@ line and with a different type of font &quot;
&quot; the page again gives the possibility to set the behaviour when a file has been altered on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a standard behavior ( automatically re @-@ load or ignore changes ) or the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the sit@@ ter gives the opportunity to set the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphical viewers , if an Grap@@ h will be opened outside of a regular meeting ( graphs in a new window or determine in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is needed . &quot;
&quot; the site administration gives the opportunity to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; graphic viewer ; you can define a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) , or determine if you want to be asked for each start afterwards . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which is normally by clicking on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens up further options : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the standard for specific graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or extrac@@ ted depic@@ tions of judicial graphs . the algorith@@ m puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to right ) and then try to produce as short edges and as possible as possible steps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ just graph graphs . it is used according to the spr@@ ing@@ board model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ K@@ aw@@ ai algorith@@ m is used , the syn@@ onymous with statisti@@ cally multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorith@@ m created for un@@ un@@ coated graphs , a spr@@ ing@@ y model in the layout . it uses the Fru@@ its @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ moon tri@@ ggers for the treatment of large and g@@ ec@@ lu@@ st@@ ained graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the node identi@@ fies in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog , in which you can specify a lay@@ out@@ command , which would then be implemented by a shell : the command should give Graph@@ ite to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such lay@@ out@@ command , you can change &amp; win ; the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms special options , or even the graphs with a filter appears before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graphs ( directed or odd ) , and uses the default algorithms for the respective type of ( dot ; for particular , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for odd graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview is displayed unless that is needed . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows what is the mouse @-@ mouse c@@ ursor . click with this mouse @-@ mouse button on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get further assistance to this item ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the basic folder of the source archive .
&amp; War@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graphic tools ; tools to display . it requires the following programs :
a special decor is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; to use . in the menu settings you will find more options .
&quot; the main window of the symbol Edit@@ ors is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the gro@@ wers for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the Git@@ tern@@ etz in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; a new symbol . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards a dialog will be created in which you can choose whether the icon will start from a template , or if you want to start new . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module pictures included tools to read tools to invite new images and add them off .
this module can be used to initi@@ ate new images and collect new sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
&quot; pictures scan , using the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images of a scanner which supported by the SAN@@ E project or a different source like video Stre@@ ams . this means that you have to install k@@ oo@@ ka and SAN@@ E . &quot;
&quot; when you open the menu entry pictures , a dialog , which you can choose between all available sources on your computer . click here the source of which you want to pick up the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace the pre @-@ given default values sil@@ cr@@ he can select your image accordingly before using the button scan the picture . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
note that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be indicated . &quot;
&quot; after you have finished the button , you have to wait until the scan completed and the window will specify the com@@ pression and type of image file . here you can select the com@@ pression and type of image file . you will also have to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; you can also create the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by the image being saved . &quot;
screenshot : you can create after you selected in the menu Im@@ por@@ ters &gt; screens ... selected . a window appears in which you can adjust the different types of the screenshot :
select the full desktop reading in order to initi@@ ate a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all its own program windows are selected , the retri@@ eve program will disappear , so that you can read other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read after a short delay , the currently visible work place . if you have read the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen@@ ings will wait before it starts . if you need to switch on other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay highly enough to navigate the time you navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screenshot is made , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above . &quot;

&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS co @-@ ordin@@ ates in the met@@ ad@@ ata of an image and process . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ sampling of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a card in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization makes tools available in order to loc@@ alize images geographical in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ator , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude , and l@@ ati@@ tudes are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML @-@ file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu on . the above to visual dialog will then load . to download a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to download a co@@ er@@ file with GP@@ X file . this file of course includes data from the same time at the same locations as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic cor@@ relation is performed , the coordinates are recorded in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera to be calculated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and cam@@ er@@ eit . lies the devi@@ ation below the data is mer@@ ged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
&quot; if you do not have Sp@@ ur@@ data from one place for pictures , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will be cor@@ related all pictures in this field . &quot;
&quot; the options of inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you do not have a suitable data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ alization in a large extent difference between camera and GPS , you can put this limits here and then push the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have done a number of photos at the same place . as the dialogue process from a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set up with the indicated map and enlarge . select the relevant region and enlarge En@@ e.@@ com. It can always be selected by you , the amount must always be selected manually . the card can be changed manually , satellite screen and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang down the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ er tool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages con@@ form to version 4.01 . you can select the albums referred to as HTML pages . the character set is U@@ TF @-@ 8 coded to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the Module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the rider selection allows all albums select which to be exported to HTML . you will quickly choose a large number of records on the right . in the area among them the Al@@ ben@@ chmarks and the text that appear in the head of the HTML page will appear .
the tab shows the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely created for each image . the option for each picture created a page in which the image will be displayed . otherwise the picture will be displayed directly with your default mark &amp; eg ;
&quot; the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images , select a folder from which you have written permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF data of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
with other color depth you can change the standard colour@@ ing . the influences of course also the file size . all other settings are explained by itself .
&quot; the Rider welcomes you some of the settings from the album rider for the umb@@ nails , which are small images to be displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break down the process .
&quot; if the module created the sides , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program &apos;s program to determine whether errors are performed during production . the web browser is automatically launched at the end to preview the gallery . press closing to the module . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I Graphi@@ cs is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to look at pictures .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image , it allows a selection of pictures to view and perform on them base operations such as screen@@ ings , zo@@ oming or rel@@ oc@@ ating . the viewer was missing with short and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after starting a picture , a photo is displayed in full @-@ screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free module is a tool to change pictures without imp@@ air your quality .
&quot; this module allows to store for the promotions listed below , pictures in JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses of quality or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the lu@@ cid storage is that the file size increases , since there is no pressing of color formations . this can be found e.g. at P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera body currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. caution : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team . &quot;
&quot; with the import -@@ function of met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the import function so that you want to copy the file folder , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied according to the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all images formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any goal . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please take a look at exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a range of images to a MPEG video in the form of a sli@@ deshow .
&quot; MPEG Co@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG @-@ Video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a audio file in the MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the sli@@ deshow . &quot;
all images are automatically added to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition you can choose a background color for the sli@@ deshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you may use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to pick the images which can be packed into the MPEG di@@ asch@@ au . after that you can start via extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you can then be ordered under pictures in the portfolio . you can also change sor@@ ting the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pre @-@ adjusted and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds which will display a picture . the speed of the image above is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high against very smooth image change . &quot;
the background color can be adjusted as next . in doubt you should leave them black . the name and the path of the generated file can be set in the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep in mind the extension mp@@ g as possible .
&quot; if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , so this will be integrated into the film . depending on your computer you can drink the creation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee or enjoy the sli@@ deshow , if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages over the button Settings right below . &quot;
&quot; the press assistant allows multiple images to print on a sheet of paper , along with standard photo@@ frame . the combined pictures can also automatically print with the image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to print you or print with the Gimp module . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your images stored in one of three formats JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original settlement of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results !
first select the RA@@ W file the converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ conver@@ ts window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now use the values new to optimize the conversion process . the first option is to be used for white settings . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be recorded . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in the R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains equal and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG makes a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ alled algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the tag@@ ged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the lu@@ cid @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to frequently edit your images or otherwise , you should not choose the JP@@ EG format , because it is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adjusted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG as storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the text information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start converting the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , so you can break down . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ kli@@ fts Mode allows you to convert various images to once . use this mode , for instance by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the options available are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , this is helpful , if this in an earlier attempt was created . a preview is not available . a preview is not available . the progress beam shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to convert all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following formats are supported : &quot;
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start @-@ up and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the modules . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the powerful program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can enlarge the image or enlarge . these are provided four types of output changes :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the picture orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your picture to the screen format .
not proportional : non dis@@ proportionate scale change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; printing preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo printing . the user can set up the print resolution and the size of the photo set . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the written pictures before .
&quot; after which you started the module , the photo window will appear with the pictures selected by you . over the button pictures , you can add more images to the button . for the last indicated image , a preview is shown on the right . &quot;
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and add it to add the images to the list below .
with the button pictures you will remove the selected pictures from the list of picked pictures .
after you have selected all pictures with the button OK the new message window will open the window of your e @-@ mail . you just have to add the addresses and the bet@@ re@@ ff . the pictures you select are attached already as an app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts do not want to send restrictions to the size of the send e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures . &quot;
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and every@@ time again until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must install the G@@ mail agent on your computer before . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the selection of comments in a hal@@ ted file , the comments on the images will be inserted into a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG , if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG among images file format , and the original files in JP@@ EG format are , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ uses will be added to sen@@ den@@ ds pictures . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically for you to see the status points , on the search for mistakes , you can view . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button Cl@@ ose you can ch@@ lie this window ? &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced sli@@ deshow , a window will be shown with questions like you want your di@@ ash@@ au . you can choose between you selected and all the pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL over@@ rides in the presentation enabled very elegant cap@@ tions using OpenGL . however , you need to have an appropriate graphics card as otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow . &quot;
the option fil@@ en@@ ame ads ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the lower left corner during the presentation is displayed .
the Schlei@@ ch option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a fin@@ ite loop . you can then manually leave them manually with Es@@ c .
the option images acci@@ dentally ensures that the pictures are displayed in an acci@@ dental order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
&quot; under delay between the images , the temporary distance between the individual images can be placed 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should do so before you show the presentation your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transitions effects that you can select . random@@ ly cho@@ oses with any transition between the images a different effect .
&quot; during the di@@ az@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; at the left side of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ ks currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. caution : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module is currently selected , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menu , as background for your KDE work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can get with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in person , places and in the group ( no entries ) . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have received your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the latest viewing pictures . in the following , each one described for themselves . &quot;
&quot; when using the mouse on the entry people , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images are shown on which both persons are to be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view and view images to see the pictures of your impact . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can see your own image , this also applies to places , keywords , and other categories that you have defined itself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button that you want to use the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category . please note that you can see for example symbols with images of individuals and at the same time a list of keywords can be displayed ( if you have no suitable pictures for your key@@ word ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must define what image is to be displayed for each person . now , you can view the image image window ( in closer ) and select in the context menu item &apos;s entry window . you can choose the image factor for your wishes and choose which part of the image is to be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you call for your entry in the main window , you &apos;ll see a dialog showing the dialogue for the feast of the image characteristics very similar . this dialog can still look at the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string into the cap@@ tion or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searching for this text . if you want , you can also be a date to be chosen , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read hand@@ books , instead prefer to try the following functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick@@ est , the screenshot and the introduc@@ tions videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help entry into the menu item ; -@@ demo . then , some example will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a continuous HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . an image of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different tim@@ ings . each bar then shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the p@@ est only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline you can use on the following ways : you can edit the indicated entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview display ) and also shows the tim@@ eline always the current date of the currently shown pictures when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by clicking the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ ings , drag yourself . you can ab@@ ort the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces you two options available to create HTML websites with your images . one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user image file is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that allows you to create across the menu file ...
&quot; before HTML pages will be created , you must make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and purpose . in the following each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first give the title of the over@@ print and a description , which is to contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album , HTML examples , you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created on the overview page . nails information on export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . therefore , you can avoid that information is shown on the viewer also without description . note that all pictures are exported . you can not use this setting to hide specific images from certain spect@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clearly , so that this is not specifically received . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions on the pictures . through this , those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more pictures can download for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the spect@@ ator of your side may change the resolution at any time . therefore , it can search your pictures with low resolution , resulting in a lower transmission period , search . if he wants to get an image below , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setup , you place the different folder and the URL where your website will be stored . &quot;
&quot; the best way to select a basic folder for all of your HTML files , and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you will need to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder you can choose to select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if these are really displayed for viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder after the pages have been created , this folder should be . otherwise , the web browser will be started in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files are not included in the final target folder , you need to manually copy it manually . thus the import function , see , correctly , you need to specify the final aim of the files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folder are . &quot;
&quot; the setting options described are all three on basic folder or URLs . in these instances , a sub@@ folder , whose name you can specify in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the images . however , if you do not have a lot of time for viewing the images , reception , etc. then you need to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not even possible . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the image features are processed with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . you differ from whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or if the file can be stored in the file , however , that you can share all the images and that file is so independent . however the obvious draw@@ back is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the pictures in two @-@ fold way . first , the pictures are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . these are the pictures of the URL that you have created when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog will export for the export of images that you can export through the menu file ... &quot;
&quot; the most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , the following three options are available : &quot;
&quot; when you copy manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option automatic to copy the .@@ k@@ im file copy , copied &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically copy for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures already com@@ pressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to com@@ press the files so simply select the option export file .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you want to send your friends images , because the .@@ k@@ im file otherwise would be very big . here you can limit the size by saying , that every picture should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Im@@ por@@ ters ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard to import it consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the original file person@@ er ( if you are a sw@@ ans ) , while this category should be imported into your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialogue window , which categories that the file imported file should be imported into your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can import the categories of the file with the categories of your current database . an example for this can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be simple to browse images and to look at : if you look at pictures of your Italy and see a picture with your boyfriend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will pass the different steps from ( 1 ) to pass the information about your images , over ( 2 ) the search and prestige , through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adaptation options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for the vulner@@ ability of your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today will also take care of your videos . on many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but frequently closes this also videos with one . &quot;
&quot; a simple XML file , all of its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that allows you to secure with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , to secure one disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they would like to secure . &quot;
&quot; check out the folder , in which your images are stored and used this at future launch automatically . if you want to start another folder in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so you can start another folder , with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Pictures / index@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album , set up ... you will enter into a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user book you will find the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; to the left you see six different symbols , with which you can call up settings for viewing and options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help you can call on the F1 button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described as you describe for each picture of different properties , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog , which is used to deal already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in dialogue options you can set complete groups , i.e. all members of a group should be placed at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in view of the settings options available , which you are at your disposal on the fixed list of members . with the above @-@ mentioned list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , you can select a list of the present category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its module with other graphics applications such as Pres@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . information on this can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the menu module . the modules can not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page you can call on the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by multiple applications among each other , it may be the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should either call the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ â \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say , I could not have been war@@ ned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that can use the modules on K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , allowing it to be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the down@@ side if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other uses supports their images in albums : this type of order is not supported , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order after albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; the current album is simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply matches the current view , so all images that can show you the picture shows . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has to be passed on ; the modules also passed a list of records . here &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is going on : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album to the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category which you have specified in the setup dialog as category for virtual albums , so if you have for example the category persons , will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so whether you have chosen people and pass this module to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove it from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the area modules which are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a start @-@ screen , once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , see the window at the top of a menu - and a tool@@ bar . at the moment we don &apos;t see a lot of information about your pictures . in the section we will show you at this window , now please click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview with all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the opportunity to see each picture with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , etc . you can put each image either individually or for a larger number of images specific comments at the same time . if for example , on all pictures of Jes@@ per . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for search and browsing , as you can read in the section , if you want to see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; find three lists with a text box by placing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the rel@@ oc@@ ating of images within the list : if you have an example of a family party and have shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people , so you can find that the names are moved upwards to find the people faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to have a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the symbol for Sor@@ ting to date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have any comments on each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and add these images with notes . simply click on the front and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture right above . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to highlight all these pictures and to use the menu item for multiple entries at one time with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is shown . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also create an entry into a category and place it in order to sort this to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the training courses by setting up the bar , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can make a separate window by setting it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; when you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... that offers you the opportunity to store the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to see this window later , use the button options ... and here window will see a / off . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you will receive an overview with notice of currently selected pictures , or all pictures in case you do not see a filter here . you can configure the size of the umb@@ nails , by simply down drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure it simple . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you want to click on a picture , this is displayed in the image . if you do not have a window with an image error , a new display will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the image below . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the remove button or select in the menu Edit selection . now you can see the window that you can see in the picture .
&quot; you can also use this problem a solution . you can also use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely pictures also use , without you stored on your hard disk . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; pictures , in which the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for example the pictures appear 1 @-@ 9 . however , the preview of these pictures are available , so you can view the preview of these pictures . however , you can also view these images with the image . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and to search again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you would like to avoid using the CD @-@ Br@@ inging of your pictures , please purchase a bigger hard disk in order to save all the images . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you filter the pictures that at the end , you may want to see for other in@@ accessible , cont@@ amin@@ ants and the menu @-@ order everything except current view . &quot;
&quot; if you set out which images are hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop now your little sister , simply tick the menu entry images , allowing all pictures that you have locked away , click on Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that must be entered to the de@@ block of the pictures . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please consider that this image protection is not very safe . on the one hand , all the images on the hard disk and on the other can easily read or delete the password used as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only suitable for those who have with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view to private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours , of course you would like to describe it at some point . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has an image _ and video consider . this allows you to start out of the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the spect@@ ator can see you in . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can simply drag this easily with your mouse and specify somewhere else . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them and switch between them . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as sli@@ deshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; invites you to press a new image after a few seconds . how often there is a new image to be controlled by pressing the Str@@ g button and plus or minus . started and stopped the di@@ asch@@ au through the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful skill of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to the screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the whole place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to the Full mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can move into the image and rip off . at the mouse button you can easily drag a rect@@ angle . with the min@@ us button , you can r@@ enter r@@ z@@ zo@@ oming The Plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how an z@@ oom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your z@@ oom so that the picture is not zo@@ omed . with the equation key sets the zo@@ oms , so each pixels on the screen is equivalent to a pixel image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that work with videos , that in the start and out of zo@@ oming is made with the Plus@@ - and testosterone key . &quot;
with the script functions from the context menu you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu .
&quot; if you look at images it can happen that you can forget an image with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can watch the view ab@@ ort and configuration dialog of the picture to add this name . however , you will probably prefer to mark the image and consider other images . &quot;
a further situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad as you &apos;re looking at one by one .
&quot; for the two examples above , the spect@@ ator offers the possibility to view images with characteristics while you watch them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the appropriate letter . in view of the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set characteristics to your images , you can see it in your browser . so , if you want to edit all the images you can edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can easily copy a module to copy the selected pictures to a CD or whatever you want . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features may display in the view view . if you can view the categories into dre view , then you can press features to the pictures by simply press the letter for the characteristic , after the picture was chosen . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you will allow you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
&quot; the old is not stored with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your own old later . &quot;
in you can see a picture on the painted picture . to turn off the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn off on the picture paint from the context menu . to end the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; working on , you need to master the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not fully control , but documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object , you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and displayed the object in the wire model . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple items at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ items are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to add a new object to the object , select the item that you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu appears so you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with delet@@ ing either from the menu bar under editing or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click to apply these changes . if you add invali@@ d values , a message will be displayed with a error description . then you can click on the input box and click on the changes with dis@@ rup@@ t@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray , you can enter the dialog dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the shown object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in your own view . &quot;
&quot; preview in the self @-@ view view and a small sample of the scene is described with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture will be selected , even if you want a part of texture ren@@ dering ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the overall texture map ) , you cruci@@ fy locally . &quot;
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can draw these controls with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the controls disappear and there will change a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the whole window . &quot;
&quot; each object is used as a wire model , a visibility level . you can indicate this value relative to the display of the higher level object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or its visibility stage , is smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar selected . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object tree and view of the object characteristics are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the default window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it any number . you can also store multiple lin@@ ts and easily switch between different settings . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under a present view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle will show the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to address multiple views , drag the anchor in the middle of another view . you can then change between views through clicking on the cardboard card into the views above . &quot;
the last possible window order forms are we@@ aving views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from the anchor to the desktop or click on the little left at the top left in the anchor bar .
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the button bar . to prevent the closing , click on the little square between arrow and cross . &quot;
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu view you can find entries for any type of views . new views are ho@@ vering , you can anchor it in any place . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can be saved to a window view . it will be displayed in a dialog , in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be correctly installed . when this manual is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering the icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item for ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the picture size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar , or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... choose the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that can recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in cardboard card size , you can wear the width and height of the ger@@ ent image . if you just want a small area of the picture , choose the cross @-@ section sub@@ section and give the image cut to ren@@ dering to the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ down quality , you can select the characteristics that is used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering , this goes from a very simple color and light model for a model with complex diff@@ user refl@@ ections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual and Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if an image is covered with only one beam the pixels , there are different mistakes . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è patterns or ste@@ pl@@ et effects in cur@@ ves and lines , moreover , sometimes details are not displayed when they are in the representation smaller than one pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general view photos with this feature better .
&quot; when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than one beam each pixels . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is adap@@ tive and adap@@ tive because every pixel is constantly expanding and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ ring color values depends . &quot;
&quot; when you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a beam depending on pixel . if the difference between the colours to the neighboring pixels , then both pixels are calculated by following a certain additional number of pixel with super sampling . if you are charged the lowest value of 4 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixels . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixel will be calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values indicated the pre @-@ level threshold , then the pixels is divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , which can be followed separately and adjusted for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be set up with the lowest value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the production of smoking for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn to J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the beams have a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use Lich@@ fi@@ ery calcul@@ ates . it takes a long time to calculate one scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map you can set , whether the alpha @-@ channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the associated rays have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray issue . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is expected , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray , select the menu item file import ... and select a file in the dialogue window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; still does not support the complete command of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if the import error messages or war@@ nings occur , a dialogue window shows a list of all reports . &quot;
if you do not support sources in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can export objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this adds to the source text of the object to the newly opened text file in the editor , just highlight the source text in the editor and drag it into the object . &quot;
&quot; with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor , you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also in your editor . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; click on the help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation to the shown object . represent the path to your documentation and the version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; looking for external files ( for example high level data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you enter files , which are not in the folder of the scene , you will also have to enter the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the colour for wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the colour for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected checks .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visible field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type features .
you can set the object @-@ catch of the points on the r@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the R@@ aster separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model , and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the requested objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering it . for some objects such as the ball you can set the details for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the high level of detail for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided when the camera is an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to perspective and the sen@@ sel@@ ections . this feature results in a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering time . &quot;
&quot; when you show walls , a wall is exposed behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess bret@@ t@@ pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you view ground , a ground below the objects is rounded . the floor is shown in a chess bret@@ t@@ pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate cant@@ ely , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . precise information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can modify existing lin@@ kl@@ ands or create new window app@@ liance . in the section window regulations , it is explained how you can create window app@@ liance and save it . &quot;
the drop @-@ down standard window : displays all existing lin@@ ts . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order in the start of the program .
the list available window lists shows all existing lin@@ ts . a new arrangement allows you to add with the button of adding and delete a selected arrangement with the button de@@ activation .
any window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can create you with the button of adding and delete selected views with the button de@@ activation .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ks anch@@ ored the window under the existing window , with card view and sw@@ allow the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just got &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , under beginners , very popular : a bul@@ let on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you complain that you as a result will only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules for ren@@ dering ren@@ dering can be applied as a result you receive a black picture . &quot;
&quot; insert not a light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have all fl@@ aw@@ less installed , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following set @-@ up window order : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can expect an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects .
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate . in particular , you notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right down ) . this is the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ age of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the item properties , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; find further details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later reserved , but note that the camera in the view controls , with which you can change the target point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; when you apply the button or press the button , the wire @-@ model views and the lens set immediately corresponding to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could add for example a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body qu@@ ader ) , and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an inevitable way to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers an easy way . you can use an infinite level as a ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the plane in the object , change the name and then push the button . in the object the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now shows the level , even if at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the level extends as far as the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re watching the object tree , you &apos;ll find that you click on the icon + in front of the object . then you will see the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object characteristics . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the ground to exercise an entity under the horizon , just so that you can get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; only select the ground to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something in the moment something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialogue opens , where you can select how the object is inserted . please choose the name in the domain name ( name = floor @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a Matt@@ atha material , because you can still need settings for pig@@ ment . therefore , you can always check the colors for pig@@ ment . also for this there are many possibilities , but you now take the simpl@@ est . &quot;
&quot; in the preview , you can see no color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the ground is now properly adjusted . if you click on the icon now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following results : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . that you have expected . here are more settings necessary . in the color list , you have to edit two new attributes . then select this entry twice ( you can also use this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the Chess@@ board menu can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; select in the Object of the Object time , and change the colors in the view of the properties Properties : &quot;
&quot; you should already be able to run this step , since you should have understood the fundamental Func@@ tioning of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should already understand the ball is just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object characteristics , you can immediately change the settings : on 1 ( do not forget the En@@ ter or the button ) , so that the ball is flowing with the bottom . otherwise , the ball is floating above the ground , since you have shifted the ground to a unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering now makes a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a Matt@@ es black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . as in the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; select First Sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on the ball pig@@ ment , select then select and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach most interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screenshot and click on or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection , already result in partial good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces , even though metal : not even selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can easily create , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ ay@@ cing is a r@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , sho@@ ots the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical cuts from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , which is reflected by the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fo@@ g work . thus , the scene is set up for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you see also nothing , the picture is to be described , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; created
&quot; always when you open or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaced the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . it &apos;s a new file , you have to enter a name and space . &quot;
the scene has been re@@ constructed in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are being ej@@ ected .
&quot; this menu entry , you can only select if you do not have any changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeated the last und@@ o @-@ made command . this menu entry , you can only select if you have used mach@@ ining back@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; saves the current window order , and opens a dialog , in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or create an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the scanning and the default behavior . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new commands to this option with this option , or add new commands . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to set up the work@@ bar . you can add and remove tool@@ platform for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands , and remove it . &quot;
&quot; a B@@ ump map is a way to set up surface , without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually , without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself . &quot;
&quot; it is custom@@ ary , the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map . &quot;
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes you can use as components : very complex 3D models are produced from do@@ zens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models are then moved on to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base using an image file as a color ticket .
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture look and navig@@ ator . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images to display . &quot;
images can be displayed either in one window in the size of the picture or in the screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button Return .
&quot; you can adjust if any image is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images can always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a certain file , simply type the first character of the file in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right lower corner . if a password has been found , the input field is highlighted by pressing by pressing by return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialog - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set in the two other , short @-@ command for the browser , the ke@@ yp@@ ad for the respective window can be specified . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the images are opened in full mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can continue to set below . default setting is not a full mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you can still select the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for sli@@ deshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when entering the name of the last opened folder . at the next time opens the ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click the coloured beams to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full @-@ mode . if in the window mode , the window is larger than the image is , also here the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can set &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , so set up that only some of the file types are displayed which can represent the program also . &quot;
with this option the scor@@ eboard is extended to the full screen . this option is switched as default .
determine whether the sli@@ deshow with the first image in the folder or the selected image is to start .
&quot; the time span between the image change at a sli@@ deshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the little arrow right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow is repeated until it is interrupted by the user . to enter the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders to the right next to the input field . the default setting is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cut for the different modes of operating &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the box maps for the scor@@ ching and short @-@ command for the browser .
&quot; with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
shows great symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
shows small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preliminary pictures for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarged the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the scor@@ eboard for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
view the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; opens the input field for understanding . enter the first signs of the file you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo processing based on the &amp; checking came ; sculp@@ ting . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; checking came ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and correc@@ tions and modification .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de , is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute to its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; as simple as possible errors or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu includes a listing reports you problems or wishes . this shows a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser will be filled with a link to reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to release your message . &quot;
&quot; this is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a more common user from the show@@ picture list , and hopefully soon we would like to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be able to answer any questions from other users . in this mailing list , you should be able to become powerful . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate at &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list , to join the developers mailing list by &amp; show@@ photo . &quot;
&quot; show@@ down photo ; tries to give you as much control over his work@@ flows , as possible . there are many options to choose the behaviour of &amp; show@@ photo ; set up on these settings . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of lighting indi@@ z@@ it@@ ators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub @-@ or over@@ se@@ aling indicator should be selected if the under@@ lining should display a bright color and over@@ clo@@ cking a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo , has a side bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and promotions to the selected pictures . you can see this page , in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;

&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for sc@@ rap materials that do not make more power as images to save and save the images immediately to a specified folder containing automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before the stor@@ ing .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page by adding the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner was not opened or if no standard scanner was indicated then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . break down &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; finish .
the other settings contain more det@@ a@@ illed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not particularly .
&quot; to view one image , the user can only launch a pre @-@ check @-@ can and then start scanning area for the final scan . the pre @-@ button can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can switch off into the image and out of the current selection of zo@@ oming . it can also set the z@@ oom so that the complete preview in the window fits . &quot;
when the picture was chosen then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when pre @-@ saving a preview display in the settings is selected , then the image is displayed in a front image , shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be stored and sh@@ lie ? en leads to a break@@ up and you will go back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the equ@@ itable dialog will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image , if desired , view before saving a preview . in this case , the option must be selected on the stor@@ ing a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user then the option must be elected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures can select . dialog to save each image opens the dialog before each image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must save saving without any fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the pictures are stored at the option and stored after a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the pictures are stored after each scan , this folder is used as standard for dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically re@@ vis@@ ing images and is moreover the proposed name for the image in dialog to save . the automatically stored image will be saved , if a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adapt the image quality to save . this value does not change the com@@ pression value while saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the kno@@ b help starts the KDE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button About starts the KDE About -@@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for settings and sn@@ ort can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs ke@@ yp@@ ass . below you can set up a list of this p@@ ac@@ tic and its function . you can set up using the right mouse button in the player window and choose a glob@@ ale button . selecting the right mouse button in the player window and choose short commands ... select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . thus make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ control centre .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which mostly also be found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts could look like : &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command @-@ lines options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own command@@ line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed due to a lack of dependence . please check your script if all required modules are present and use the dialog , so that the user ID is not running . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum ( KDE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is for this script . &apos; &apos;@@ k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can easily use it as a basis for your own scripts , or simply add it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ante and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which every KDE installation should teach .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . on this , strings on the default output of the script is written . of this , script should monitor their default output and do according to events . of course , a script can ignore the events when there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the script dialog . to run the stor@@ ing and loading of the furniture data , each script should take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ folder on the folder , where all data should be saved . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ aled that a new piece is tr@@ acked . the script could now ask for example ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the st@@ umps ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alized a change of volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ is@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu item@@ tit@@ le , de@@ duc@@ ted the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry is displayed . to remove an entry again , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok Script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok , ends , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed so , e.g. the stor@@ ing of data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ oks script management can also install script packages that can download the user &amp; eg ; from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which can also be downloaded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which can also be able to detect the archive as a Amar@@ o@@ script script . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok , 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Exten@@ sion amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should correct your script packages straight away . &quot;
&quot; the main cri@@ pts must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file right : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can download it at www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and follow the link to the Wi@@ ki script page from &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus instead of your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting @-@ browser and the quick@@ set you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you would like ? then the play@@ lists are still hard to select , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music based on certain criteria . &quot;
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . additionally , many different audio systems can be used so you can hear your music . Amar@@ o@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and fancy - just the right to experience your music new ! &quot;
&quot; usually , in the basic folder of the Amar@@ o@@ sources you have to enter the following : to compile Amar@@ ok and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok , auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no trouble when compile no trouble . if you encounter any problems , please report these to the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; has like most applications you can activate or de@@ activate a compilation with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be fulfilled , so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating de@@ bug@@ ging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help developing &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; it can be set up without any trouble using the furnishings . the furniture dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
&quot; player window un@@ folded the player window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists &quot;
&quot; voting bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ oo@@ ges , the option bu@@ ds the experimental function of the m@@ oo@@ om@@ eters . &quot;
&quot; setting full size : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ oo@@ ather . thus , the color scheme for the m@@ oo@@ ometer is modified . &quot;
&quot; voting files in the music files : this feature is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ oo@@ dy . if this setting is activated , .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ oo@@ able / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browsers : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok , should be started when a browser is needed . &quot;
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not found in the list below .
&quot; playlist upon saving , saves the current playlist automatically at the finish of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when finishing . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manual playlist : if you activate this setting , will use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use the absolute position of the music files . &quot;
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ date pieces in the piece @-@ change , causes the play@@ lists windows - / off @-@ roll in order to keep the current piece always in the invisible window area . &quot;
&quot; in the piece @-@ change to the context @-@ browser , it automatically displays the context @-@ browser , as soon as the next piece is tr@@ acked . &quot;
in the section image you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is split into three parts .
&quot; in the fonts , you can use the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . you can select items for the following domain : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context @-@ browser . press releas@@ ing ... , so you can choose a required font in the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the tor@@ ment of choice and can set a own color scheme . just use the activated color selection for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; playing at the start , that &amp; Amar@@ ok , after the program start playing the play@@ back automatically with the piece at the place , with which it was stopped in the last finish . &quot;
the under@@ window on @-@ screen display enables you to use the entry of the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this review . &quot;
the first option is the font . click on excer@@ pts ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the cross @-@ border shadow means that the text in the O@@ SD sh@@ aded is shown .
&quot; using own colors gives you the opportunity to custom@@ ize the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color @-@ surfaces opens the dialog on the color selection . if sel@@ ects colors do not use activated , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors will not be used . &quot;
the input field display text marks the text displayed in the O@@ SD text . by type of space @-@ posts the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of the available points of space and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to set out on which screen a multi @-@ way monitor environment should appear .
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers activate more settings in this box map .
the map collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can choose the folder containing &amp; Amar@@ ok , search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the cross field next to its name . this section also contains an@@ cross fields on how to proceed with selected folders . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ folder , search : this means that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , both the sho@@ cking and whose sub@@ folder to search will search . &quot;
&quot; changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , in order to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists import , means that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists included in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection add . the automatically added playlist will appear later in the play@@ lists . &quot;
the part of collecting database is used to choose a database for the collection . the drop @-@ down driver : allows you to choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is needed yet further furnishings in the sub @-@ window My@@ S@@ ql entity is needed .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql institution is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . under calcul@@ ator : will the calcul@@ ator type in which the database is available , which is easily accessible via the database . name : is the database name , to which the connection is made . &quot;
use username : and password : to use the data needed to connect to the database .
the card @-@ card bur@@ .@@ f@@ m is aimed at support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can provide the names of fed mos@@ quit@@ oes to a load .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations concerning the current part .
&quot; here , enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send pieces and update so the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your duty .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters are calling : after activ@@ ating this setting will call &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the respectively played piece . you can see the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you need no last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and gallery with the screenshot .
Amar@@ ok takes only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further KDE packages . you have to install k@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs included in it ) because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD are ahead that your window manager will function the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . GNO@@ ME will work for example , but flu@@ x@@ box will help for example . we try to use Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they present an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ b library to days . you can see the file out by ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the crash file . afterwards you can delete the file and release the collection again .
mostly this is the case that Tag@@ lib is ab@@ st@@ alled when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . is something mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version were compiled . if B. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then leads to pl@@ unge in editing of met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate automatic . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least not a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ pedal per e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) , and you will send us a good che@@ er , the mistake will be solved . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 to the met@@ a info , but this is not known as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / perl the &quot; &quot; $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; print _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ E &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s symbols will always be active in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbols effect can be activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times , until this setting will show its effect . &quot;
if you get these errors : amar@@ ok@@ app : amar@@ ok@@ app : an icon symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ MC Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check whether Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ Ag@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos;@@ _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ zing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems be resolved by using an expert on your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or with the developers . they can also use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to seek help . please enter there only one mistake if there is something at the removal of an error in Amar@@ o@@ ath itself .
&quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only a blank playlist will appear . how can there be music pieces there ? &quot;
this is easy . use the file browser to the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively it was converted into the Statisti@@ cs window . you can find it under Extr@@ as statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are automatically calculated for assessing the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , must be displayed in the playlist column . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press En@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
drag a play@@ lists file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there just as you would like it with other files . so simple this is : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the add @-@ button , the button is to store playlist . click on it . &quot;
presum@@ ably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look even to lib@@ visual , this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition you will find it via the menu bar under Extr@@ as E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , this is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the Back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question is what media types does G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support text and P@@ NG de@@ code ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which means that no MP3 @-@ Dec@@ oder will be supplied ( from pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; playing MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ SA S@@ ink driver with the AL@@ SA S@@ ink , the device needs to use a mix@@ er . a mix@@ er allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be achieved through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( software mix@@ er ) . check out the Help D@@ mix for AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; the output of this instruction should help you in finding the problem of problems and find a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another s@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ wine ) . &quot;
&quot; does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already , you don &apos;t forget that media first need to be de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is looking for most people the best choice when you &apos;re looking for a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ code the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly at AL@@ SA just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real time list ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia @-@ Co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause play@@ back play@@ back . read this error report . enlarge En@@ cyclop@@ ae@@ dia of Sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA tool file .@@ as@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot;
&quot; do not use the Arts drivers , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE multimedia complete to obtain the fastest Arts @-@ Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ef@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less than respond to visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , rus@@ hes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ? &quot;
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you must register all components . perform G@@ ST register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help you can also ask at the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( stop Amar@@ o@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg down to compile and install it . then enter the Module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok , is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . moreover , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play
&quot; this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;re getting from the gentle tones of music that you stopped in front of the bed . &quot;
how can I find current titles at &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok when you get to another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you interpre@@ ter and titles of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ used name Amar@@ o@@ player now@@ is
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA is present .
&quot; the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok , window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in size modi@@ fiable windows . &quot;
the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button puts a piece in the cli@@ ck@@ ery sequence into the queue for a search in the playlist upon a search in the playlist will be the first results result and the search is reset .

&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database can not be created and on the console , many error messages appear . &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to move ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok on a local drive or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL @-@ support .
&quot; insert the CD one , then click on the menu on audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . read in the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic en@@ code , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;

&quot; basically , this adap@@ ts the previous review with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play was played . the more often the piece was played , the less impact has every single review on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the rating for a piece by clicking on a button , just like all other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece and edit : rating : feedback or F@@ 2 . you can edit the review also in the dialog met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want to present you when you are going to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have set up a fixed release plan , which cannot be combined with the short notice plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ ok , but some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon when playing anim@@ ate in general settings . &quot;

&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please download the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and therefore also a lot of error reports . &quot;
&quot; presum@@ ably , &amp; Amar@@ ok was compiled before you have x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer have installed . therefore , the . / configure routine these output emo@@ du@@ le has not compiled . you must configure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new configure and install . &quot;
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok , new installed , but the output model will still not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; probably use a distribution , which is installed the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files . you have to install the same package for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re @-@ compile and install again . &quot;
I get the mistake G@@ stre@@ amer @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ ics that is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ ics . you have to compile a tip of Merlin T@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or M4@@ A files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , must be installed besides g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to be the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play a MP3 @-@ stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system @-@ managed G@@ ST register . then start Amar@@ o@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
under settings Amar@@ ok set up ... audio output insert the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine using an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ int@@ el@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug @-@ sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ int@@ el@@ 8x@@ 0 { type : sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter the dialog dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio a , and the output is done on the USB @-@ sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the copies , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , you dis@@ able the tick on sound@@ card . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio edition with Arts will not take care of . you may of course take this problem yourself into your hand ! if you like , you can send the new so much needed staff for Arts : ) &quot;

&quot; if you specify a certain search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : &gt; 50@@ th This is looking for mos@@ quit@@ oes that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to look for a piece that does not contain a certain search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something searches for mos@@ quit@@ oes , which do not do anything . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these synchron@@ ous variants for popularity . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all the mos@@ quit@@ oes , which either Mike old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment . &quot;

&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , then activate the latest possible dynamic mode : settings dynam@@ ical mode . this will use your existing playlist as start @-@ point . over the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can be disabled again . &quot;
the button New fill the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . playlist will edit the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
&quot; with a right click on a dynamic playlist you have the option to click on editing . then , the dialog opens to the editing of the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; here enter any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this attitude is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be over@@ looked and they will be active in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces are placed under consideration of setting played pieces . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played songs , which should be kept up at the beginning of the playlist . this way , you can easily see which pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that should be added after each played piece into the playlist . if you set out more than 1 , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right has already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialogue , you can choose from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you can add multiple play@@ lists and add pieces from each of the play@@ lists play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by clicking the script and then click on setup .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; script install , install on script by installing the script . after you install the script , a new entry in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet . use the button other scripts . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select the script script then click on D@@ ein@@ stall . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on writing own scripts , please check in the section writing of scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window Visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins will be used to share the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok . the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply enable the cross @-@ lane next to the name . &quot;

cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Dis@@ cs Digital Audio ) . on the Internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
og@@ g Pres@@ ent library : og@@ g Pres@@ ent is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ free and professional technology for audio coding and for dealing with audio files . og@@ g pres@@ ump@@ y benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ til Dec@@ o@@ der@@ - and En@@ coder modules . &quot;
&quot; MA@@ D : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio de@@ coder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 de@@ coder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a far developed MP3 @-@ Dec@@ oder which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ En@@ coder module .
FL@@ AC : a free open source co@@ dec for ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free audio com@@ pression and de@@ com@@ pression . it is used by FL@@ AC @-@ Dec@@ oder module and the external audio @-@ en@@ coder module so you can read FL@@ AC files .
&quot; Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FL@@ AC , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : further libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example to de@@ code W@@ MA files to use them on an audio CD . &quot;
&quot; SO@@ x : a auxiliary program , which can be up between different audio formats and convert . SO@@ x is used by the SO@@ x Audio En@@ coder module . &quot;
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : one in the functionality of fully equipped car system to edit , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ sing video CDs and Super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adapt the volume of music files to a standard level ; for example , for the creation of rented x@@ s CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording sessions of the various albums can lead to the un@@ good effect that the music pieces differ depending on the subject . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically enter all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
&quot; this is a convenient method , recently opened projects once again . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new date . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project under a new date . KDE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file . &quot;
saves all infl@@ atable projects . this is the same as if you were using file save for each individual project .
&quot; includes the current project . if a project is changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; asking what has to happen . you can then break up between save and changes . furthermore , you can also ab@@ ort the sn@@ ort and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any non @-@ stored project , which is to happen , just as if you were called for any project file . &quot;
&quot; closed all open projects and termin@@ ates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for any non @-@ stored project , what should happen to be done , so as if you had called the file . &quot;
&quot; if you call this entry , you can enter the compar@@ ative dialog files to the project . this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data @-@ CD , the added files in the basic folder of the CD releases . &quot;
&quot; open dialogue &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; to the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . the burning dialog can only open when the project already contains data . &quot;
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many proj@@ ections @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings that will be most of them via the What is it ? -@@ Help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you connect files to the current project . this is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ user meeting . it is useful for you to use files for a multi @-@ user meeting . it is used for you more than help so that you can already see the existing files and folders .
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature set up &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . these function remo@@ ves any files from the medium , it only ends the previously imported files back . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . this allows also without project file , copying a CD to another medium . alternatively you can also use just a picture from a CD . besides , there is also the possibility of K@@ lon@@ ens instead of normal cop@@ ier . you should also prefer to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video @-@ CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copying dialog . this allows also without project file , copying of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use just a picture of a DVD using the copying dialog . besides , there is also the possibility of working instead of a DVD using the copying dialog , therefore , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
open the dialog to form a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) which makes the content completely er@@ ased . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose the choice between writing model and incre@@ mental .
&quot; burning a previously created CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c -@@ file as a data source , which is then immediately not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning a previously released DVD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which can then be burned by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously released DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used all@@ ein@@ standing . it contains information about the read video , co@@ di@@ er@@ settings and even possibilities to change the size and to cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the advertis@@ ed medium . this information is displayed in the contents and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of the work@@ pieces of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is indicated , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small body is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view covers an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media information , lock and dismis@@ sal of the run or out of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view turns one or out . the content view enables the selection and drag files to the project view . the content view is also the interface to reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; turns the Kop@@ di@@ ste in the project view a or off . the copying is a narro@@ wer area , which only visible when the project view has open projects . the Cou@@ saus@@ ages has no real function , it only looks pretty , and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window to change the buttons for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the commands available in the upper part , you can adjust the buttons to it below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; furnis@@ hing assist@@ ants . this allows you to enter the correct cre@@ denti@@ als to burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system @-@ managed rights need , therefore you need to enter the password for the system administration ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here general programs can be made . nearly all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alisation and to the tuning of the program .
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can use either the command program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so it is better your taste and the way of your tasks are decisive in what the program you submit . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we take note that you use the command program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which are all &amp; k@@ de ; program used , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other features for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ COP@@ ref creat@@ e@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ X@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ X@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ X@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ X@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ X@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ X@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ X@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ X@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref creat@@ e@@ J@@ m@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void t@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ d ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such an creat@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface :
&quot; void e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void ap@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : list URLs , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) void ren@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ Name ) void set@@ vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; this is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folder and then insert files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT creat@@ e@@ Fol@@ der foo d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT ch@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ n / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / foo / bar
&quot; the audio creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read@@ able for &amp; k@@ de ; . with him can easily be saved audio @-@ CD ; s , and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the machine . &quot;
&quot; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; -@@ data in W@@ AV files on hard disk ) and by many codes ( com@@ pression @-@ free com@@ pression ) are still supported by Linux distribution ) . further Ko@@ di@@ erer can still be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD will be read and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free and com@@ pressed ) ; and then &quot;
in a second step these W@@ AV files are usually com@@ pressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or other formats like the ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free FL@@ AC .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; ger@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ atives have already been installed . all these programs are usually not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , if for example FL@@ AC does not use , this installation is also not required . &quot;
which co@@ di@@ er@@ or / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ ders , audio quality and com@@ pression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia , for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware version of the CD ; / DVD device can handle protection , it is not possible to deal with the mechanisms of cop@@ ier protection ; simply avoid the purchase of cop@@ ier @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; however , while the single dialog needs to be made ( the furnis@@ h dialog can only be called up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; this leads us ( hopefully ) to comprehen@@ sion for the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert in many formats - depending on which co@@ den@@ ers programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can use &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB to the Internet , or can operate completely without a network , where everything is gathered manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a brief list of commands of the main window . on the side step by step , you will find further information , such as this program is used as well as screen@@ caps with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the installation of inquiry in the registration card CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case must first be established the connection to the Internet . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if a en@@ coder is configured in the tab &apos;s file settings - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available En@@ coder , so that choosing with another en@@ coder as the default can be read . it is observed that previously the en@@ coder is configured in the registration card settings in the furniture dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already out@@ sour@@ ced file will be selected rather than a complete &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the interior dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main dialog of &amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different cardboard cards ( such as En@@ coder , to address the En@@ co@@ ders ) . so here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes key quality , co@@ ders and com@@ pression rates and helps you choosing the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a lu@@ cid audio format requires . besides FL@@ AC there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may possibly be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are the low com@@ pression rates and hardly any available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information provided by data com@@ pression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG is the most common . og@@ g may have an easy advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences will generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will nevertheless be supplied free with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG , compared to O@@ GG , we also compared with O@@ GG . &quot;
og@@ g - if only music should be heard from one machine or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) , or special car stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list with parameters for audio quality and the resulting com@@ pression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most musical pieces of acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo and high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , com@@ pression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo and high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , com@@ pression rate approximately 5.5 . needs more and 256 k@@ bps for complex and fewer complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo equipment with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , com@@ pression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good recovery for music by young people , portable devices and auto@@ immune systems . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that are manually entered by the program automatically from the free@@ DB program , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; ger@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the co@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of programs for the codi@@ fier and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the codi@@ fication explain the switches on these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , adding the &amp; CD ; title to the sampling ( English : day ) , when MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; audio @-@ audio creator ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in the assist@@ ants ) :
&quot; that &apos;s what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which individuals can download the audio CD , so that all others can download this information instead of being written into the calcul@@ ator : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not of the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the U@@ eber@@ ger ) I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information or less worth@@ less , so it can be obtained neither the artist nor the music business damage . all information can be obtained from a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to choose a cross field ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This may only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; au@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; used to use the free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally uses the closest mir@@ r@@ ored server . this saves band@@ width in the network and resem@@ bles the load between machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org offers a current list of mir@@ rors for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information on the read of a &amp; CD ; alternatively you can download the complete database or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ors that used to be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to know more precisely in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to be noted that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package should be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet done .
&quot; for saving the W@@ AV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be elected and thus the desired file format . at first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FL@@ AC ( a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free com@@ pression for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ ders can be added to this tab . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution , before the code can be used , and this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined co @-@ file . for more information about Co@@ di@@ erer can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
after installing a codi@@ le you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a consoles window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . there must be &apos; l@@ ame &apos; to be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
&quot; this can have many causes . check the establishment of the device recording of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) installed . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a reference to what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copied audio CD ; check out the envel@@ ope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , there is no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to be able to set the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all set up and read our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to produce MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sampling ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your machine . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is considered not completely free software as it is not necessary to compile source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have scre@@ aming on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
the first section covers the basic inst@@ al@@ ment of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which will probably only be done once and
&quot; the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD , what needs to be repeated for each read@@ able &amp; CD . &quot;
here we determine the com@@ pression co@@ den@@ ers for the com@@ pression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy to use the program to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change one &amp; CD at any time , once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device @-@ drawing is delivered to the read@@ able program that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently , / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the real device recording of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the effective device can also be accessed through the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt using existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the card @-@ card General settings . here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be created / inspired as in the screenshot .
&quot; just ask for un@@ complete information , so that you will be informed when information on the creation of sampling ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; -@@ settings . just choose both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD automatically via the Internet from a free@@ DB machine .
note : the machine needs to be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD with the Internet so that he can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second drop @-@ down list is easier , a &amp; CD entry is found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; it &apos;s with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame directory / fil@@ en@@ ame &gt; ren@@ ame , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , further notice : if you wish to manually enter everything manually , so activate the selection fields and free@@ DB will not be used . however , this over 620 MB large , you &apos;ll need to use the database before . however , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set on the following card map . &quot;
CD@@ DB is for us to free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system get the CD to get ? read the section about the free@@ DB . put it on how it is pic@@ tured in the screenshot .
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server in your vicinity . on this road the load is distributed between the machines . however this setting will work as a first attempt .
&quot; both are equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls use the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there is perhaps more happiness with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we don &apos;t want to transmit a &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first cross @-@ breeding should dis@@ able .
simply take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time when just an existing drive ? Parall@@ el@@ es Read and Ko@@ tend ? the author does not know , therefore simply try yourself . &quot;
CD ; reading the last piece ( s ) : cruci@@ fy this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are available for temporary files , then / must be saved to the path / folder , in which the W@@ AV files are available , the files will not be displayed in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to make something with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; all to enter as it is on the screenshot . the command is a bit long , under conditions something must be turned to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . this achieved com@@ pression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption . &quot;
note the entry &quot; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output of output ( including the full path ) .
Set the rest as in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; at the same time , W@@ AV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to coding more than one W@@ AV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that is , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; au@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is described on the hard disk , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will need to pick up . the process of the process described in this section must be repeated for each read@@ able &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we have a &amp; CD ; use that the screenshot is not included in the free@@ DB , the screenshot is a little different from the data for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of retri@@ eve them from the internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD is now ; into the drive , which has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and its length in the window should be listed , just as in the screenshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; identified and from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia could be read . &quot;
if this is not happening then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to previous section regarding basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up by the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and then the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key to your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can choose the database entry , which your opinion is best for your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the lat@@ ch for the automatic query of the free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialogue for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger it by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e @-@ step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - entry of the CD @-@ Data and the Tit@@ le of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screenshot one . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; The rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
&quot; the artist must not be entered into the input field &quot; &quot; Current titles &quot; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece . &quot;
the lower comment field can be used for each comments ini@@ di@@ os@@ ell per piece and the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD Editor . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editors ( e.g. whether all the words with large letters begin or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , Album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tag , you have unlimited app@@ liance . this option will set you a look at the tab &apos;s name settings . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day @-@ information of the generated files later on time with the day editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all co@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the codi@@ le to get more information .
&quot; just select an entry , which obviously agre@@ es with the style of the per@@ tin@@ ent CD ; this is not important , as we do not submit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway . for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example can be found under rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editors will appear again and you &apos;ll see that the fields marked for the album has already been filled with the entered data . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . simply enter the item for the fields of the item in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you get all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown on the piece list .
note that there is a check @-@ character prior to each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked so are read out . a simple click on the line will select the selection of the piece or select the button all the pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once .
&quot; by clicking on the button select the reading process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the returns , and follow what was going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to turn on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is read straight on the hard disk . the status of the program is shown in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
&quot; this error message can be seen when you are trying to work with a co@@ worker , which you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully coded , marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in example . have you checked whether you have writing to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now , it is clear why the bug occurred directly after the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . hence , reading and coding parallel . notice the status notification in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has found no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behaviour is the number of parallel processes for reading and en@@ code . on high @-@ performance machines the result is unclear . the calcul@@ ator used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at the same time reading and code ( of however two different pieces ) .
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create com@@ pressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG require you need the codi@@ fier of your choice .
&quot; today , as part of the k@@ ic@@ ide package ; CV@@ S is already familiar with CV@@ S , you can download from there an anonymous copy here . most distri@@ butions you have already done a pre @-@ compiled package . if you read this , you have probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons who compile data files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help on how the program can be adapted to your needs , once it runs , then the following is right for you : &quot;
a program that calls for many different other programs has many variants of settings . the best way to get to know the options and settings . it shows the screenshot of the different boxes of settings and also includes comments for options that may not be used in the example .
&quot; hello , still on reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first @-@ time start@@ up of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it goes on from this somehow empty screen ( especially when at the time of the program you do not have an audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu from ? &quot;
&quot; what is it ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should somehow look like : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version of a manual for a manual and I want to do it . at least only after hearing with the author . and if you read this , he has abandoned this section and therefore does not agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if it has been able to catch the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need this information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ oke esp@@ ace of &amp; k@@ de ; . beside others he did not have with real @-@ time graf@@ ic and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ authenticity sign of texts also some properties that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player does not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; supports also the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ aso@@ und project driver that is needed for the CIS . AL@@ SA will be involved as soon as there is a Sequ@@ encer .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid , shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel through high@@ lighting the penet@@ rated buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window on K@@ Mid can move .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song@@ writers or textures ) .
&quot; seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; finish during the play@@ back of a song , K@@ Mid will start again with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open daily ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window to fall into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will also work with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and bet@@ ray the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play from the menu piece or bet@@ s the void . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid , one piece automatically starts , once you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with multiple pieces , they will be added to a collection and then play@@ back each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid , one piece takes place , you can jump to any point by using the middle mouse button and drive with the rain and forth . &quot;
&quot; when you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the Tem@@ plates . to get back the original pace , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the Le@@ ads has two tasks : when a piece will be played , a pressure on the kno@@ b as a pressure on the kno@@ b break or selecting the menu entry into the menu piece , so inter@@ rup@@ ts the back . bet@@ s the Le@@ ads while no play will be played , starts &amp; k@@ mid , starts playing . &quot;
lyrics can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use text event and others use lyrics and another both . some pieces do not have a text : - )
&quot; in addition , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the events type automatically has to adjust that you have to adjust nothing manually . however , if you choose not to add anything manually . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select from the menu settings the entries file events or song@@ writers . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you put together . these will be played in line . in this section you can use the collections efficiently .
&quot; to add a collection , first open the collectors &quot; collection . this can be found in the menu collection under the point of Organ@@ ise .... click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then select the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the th@@ inners in the collectors &quot; collection . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all the songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; in passing the application , this collection is not stored . concern that when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it needs to add songs to a collection . there you can add a song with the button of adding a song . it appears in turn the file dialog , with which help you choose the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is activated a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag and drop ) automatically added to the active collection .
&quot; when Autom@@ atic to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and ma@@ stered . this collection then continues to add @-@ opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collecting bearings , select the collection and the desired song and then click for removal . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs can be played . if you select the set off from the sub @-@ menu copies of the menus , the songs are played in order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or choose a random order in the menu , the order will be set . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collectors &quot; folder , or use the selection list above the Car@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to further jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or push the key arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump off the reverse a song , select the button Previous piece , the entry predic@@ tive pieces from the menu piece or push the key arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collectors &quot; collection , select the show@@ y collection and click on the button Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored at the leaving of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events translated into events that understands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map showing all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always leaves a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound@@ card , you do not need MIDI map because all the sound@@ card is GM -@@ compatible ( incl. A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM radio devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that saves all necessary items for the play of a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section which may appear as often as desired . however , that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... END Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further Key@@ map ... END Def@@ ine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... END Options ... END
&quot; you see that Def@@ ine is needed , to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and END that the end of a paragraph is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your Map file as an email , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; Support can offer for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard is shown . the general usage looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ itable sign is ignored . it is believed that the GM patches in the right sequence are available ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes , which need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard , for example do not take a gun ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which may take the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( Win ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term &quot; &quot; Drum patch &quot; &quot; patch is meant to be a different percus@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , basin , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one who means the tone that is always the same drum ( as some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to give as notes on a specified channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as its availability . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to make notes on the per@@ tin@@ ent channel . take a look at the details supplied by Key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to switch some channels to others . if you want to s@@ wap for example the first and second channel , make it easily at CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the perc@@ ussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ De@@ vices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section so has 16 lines , numbered between 0 and 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; N is the channel , which is formed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map does not need to be defined in the file name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events are ignored that will change the patch on this channel . in this case it will always be patch x used . &quot;
the option For@@ ce@@ patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ tin@@ ent patch on the per@@ kus@@ sions channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ ch Rati@@ o will be multip@@ lied with the value of the Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events . if a MIDI file is converted with the value , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is calculated and then transmitted only . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file is not dec@@ im@@ al @-@ mas . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed , because GM is said that a keyboard , which is to play a pitch using the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards by two notes up to an oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole bunch of pi@@ vi@@ ons ( one for any MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ vi@@ ons you see which sounds are just played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view also to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can choose a tool , the button is no longer green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the pointed notes . the view select in the menu settings below the point of Kan@@ al@@ view : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you can , for example , a song is too quick to follow the text you can slow down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that has to be played on how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . . thus , the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this may happen if you have a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support have been compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s Home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Sup@@ por@@ mid ; D@@ rag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select all the files and drag them onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
enable previously the setting of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can switch the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ plates to slow down the play@@ back . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can click on the LCD panel .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; working area a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way I have to play a MIDI file or I want to play a file in the window or I want to play a file in the window and enter the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will add to the temporary collection . opening of files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the setup automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then do you get to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me , to program further to &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; I was written in the third year by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m in the third year , so I &apos;m not much leisure time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to gather a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , making music and prove phrases . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ a@@ oke files if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your residence or an MID@@ I@@ - / Kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you want to send me a MIDI file , but you should contact me because I perhaps already have the file . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid , completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t like to have money for that money . I therefore would like to emphasize that I can only be more program@@ m@@ able , because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;

&quot; my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the testing of the A@@ we support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , Magn@@ us pe@@ pper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Hans @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ st , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a defect , or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid , also found on his homepage , which can be found at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you can also find links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer since the sound quality depends on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM device or an A@@ we card .
&quot; if you have no sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you could hear a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program used to play video files of the m@@ player or PH@@ ON@@ ON supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished yet than &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer it was installed .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The KDE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is formed from so called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . op@@ tionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a information window that will only be shown when information is displayed in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to send the prefer@@ ential connections among the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which can be played according to each other , so you should use the category of thum@@ b playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarch@@ ical studio . if you have an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and the play@@ back begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; actual pieces &apos; , television and durability playlist can also be modified by direct E@@ di@@ ls of the XML configuration files . of course , one can only do if &amp; km@@ player . of course , you can only do that if you choose a category . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ cks , from the menu view and select only the XML content of this part . &quot;
&quot; after changing of XML files , the menu has to be selected from the menu of the same with playlist , and select either the editing mode , or another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes will be lost , if the editing mode left or another group will be selected without the playlist . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player , some functions can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation at the starting and finishing can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can simply be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; km@@ player ; will be the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ l / share / apps / km@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at the starting point does not need to be short , it will be automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be bother@@ ed by the end @-@ animation however , the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favourite photos : &amp; lt ; body@@ bed ; &amp; lt ; : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ is ; In the source package of &amp; km@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; km@@ player .
there is a rider for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; . here the path can be set from the m@@ player and the storage size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of km@@ . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playlist in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; all must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&quot; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; km@@ player ; it can even be played , even the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML can be added . &quot;
to re @-@ establish the &amp; km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages you have to reproduce the &amp; km@@ player ; module as service provider for the m@@ ime type . / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the single @-@ dialog file app@@ ings of KDE .
&quot; the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; km@@ player , is to search in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no error occurs , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; km@@ player ; ( view , console , or console comes from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus the back@@ end back@@ end for a particular m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been established ) , this must be done by a manual modi@@ fying the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , PH@@ ON@@ ON will release all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; using TV cards ; can be downloaded from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data records ) settings in the Settings - &gt; Sour@@ ces &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ video port to use . there should be ports of ports , e.g. it &apos;s PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
since the V@@ DR can use support for fre@@ player only X@@ Video ( probably this type of play@@ back of video devices under Linux the only one works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server needs to function in its configur@@ ations file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
&quot; internally by KM@@ Player is used for sources of different names . at the time of origin of this documentation , these dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , source source , source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing with the play@@ lists . &quot;
are there indications as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive when I do not play on it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is to be able to execute as user root according to the device &apos;s device . it is sure to make sure / dev / CD@@ ROM drive on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
X@@ ine starts only slowly but why every time my CPU has to be tested on their performance ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ y@@ k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time will test x@@ ine the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user surfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling of &amp; k@@ ile ; needs .
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional bri@@ efs application . under Unix @-@ like systems is probably accessed on the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; for installation should be attracted to the documentation of the distribution or inst@@ aller CD ; / DVD .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages from &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions , these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website . &quot;
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual , however , all suggestions for documentation have to be considered . however , the support for this project or its documentation is required to get in touch with the k@@ ile ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about or when comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile ; to or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list of k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net . &quot;

&quot; just as other sig@@ nat@@ ing languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , which are specified on the general properties such as paper format , side num@@ eric , and scrip@@ tions with the text . the introduction may start with the command \ \ the { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the quick entry @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is an easy feature for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the choice of assist@@ ants ( men@@ Ã ¼ ller ) provides some possibilities for the preparation of the document . it can also be made some of the document related settings .

&quot; now , new users will not worry about . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information can be given in the section . &quot;
&quot; offers - just like other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . through &amp; k@@ ile ; it is likely to notice it by the modest appearance of output files . however , it will save you by the hum@@ id times and over time . &quot;
&quot; with automatic verification of the environments , when entering a new instruction ( e.g. \ \ with { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a blank line ( to the input of the text ) and the related line to the command code ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this feature can be disabled in the menu command , set up ... La@@ TeX commands . &quot;
&quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; ex@@ al@@ able the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most part , and sub@@ jun@@ ctive element ) : &quot;
&quot; in view of the document in the structural view , the single elements can be changed by a mouse @-@ click on the respective object . &quot;
when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful in creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex . as soon as an DVI ; -@@ file &#91; ger@@ Ã ¤ n@@ oun ) &#93; was created , jump &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer for the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; -@@ file contains a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is adjacent to PDF , the output ear@@ t of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , transformation and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and odor . &quot;
&quot; when using the file search , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file has been cli@@ cked with the editor , and once upon an element in the DVI ; -@@ source code is folded , the per@@ tin@@ ent section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text is cli@@ cked , becomes the appropriate place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
Master &apos;s document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with other inter@@ .@@ tex files . when using a project a project project can be set to project settings .
quick @-@ speed : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there is no error in the source code ) .
&quot; file growth : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file on Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ ungen@@ lied , and there is no call from &amp; Oc@@ ular ; after the quick@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; in view of the processing fields , the three large number of choices should be taken into the document . the selection fields have been developed for the fast entry of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... the available &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection field is available for the purpose of articles such as tags , Fu@@ Ã ¶ h@@ ops or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , an image or other element created . &quot;
reference : is used for a reference to a fixed term ( choice ) .
&quot; when using quot@@ ation , a selection list is displayed with liter@@ ary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can be written naturally also in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for setting the fonts , and it can be specified for the main text , the Fu@@ els music etc . there are the following fonts for disposal : &quot;
&quot; in the call of &amp; k@@ ile , two sel@@ ections are available : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and fast@@ ening settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ the class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; is fixed by the font . if Scripture is not at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
once the above @-@ text example was entered the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of menu building or the button @-@ speed .
the source text must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for the storage automatically out .
&quot; lo@@ ops the comp@@ iling of the document error , should be looked for in the log into the errors . when using rapid construction should be started &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; this is not the case , should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the scri@@ be of 12 is created and just a few sentences . the command \ \ with { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } . &quot;
air conditioning are only within the environment ( of \ \ with { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no circum@@ cis@@ ing in an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities for enligh@@ tening the reading and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it can be added for example certain fonts , air pressure , low pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands may end either with the command \ \ end , or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is as long as until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a sentence can be presented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } curve .
\ \ : : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background is presented for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mark@@ er language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide to create a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as in the assist@@ ants a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . you should take a quote , a few places in fat and cur@@ ves and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the document has been viewed , using editor @-@ View or Str@@ g E can be turned back to the editor ( at internal viewer ) . at an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the DVI @-@ file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; just try and enjoy . &quot;
DVI ; is a tricky file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ b ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read the read@@ ability of some drivers from the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi -@@ Issu@@ es as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ converting or computer imaging . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the use of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the printer can be printed properly ( if the printer is set up properly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar bu@@ ys the conversion of the DVI ; -@@ file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text was created , the conversion to be washed in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the pros provided the direct jump from the editor to the appropriate position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ Ã ¤ r@@ Files . for this , only Modern under settings can set up ... tools B@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; to carry out the pre @-@ search box , the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor on a line of the source is positioned and close to pre @-@ search box . the jump to the corresponding location in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is so@@ bedient . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; - document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; k@@ ile ; must be set up &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor set up ... editor )
&quot; should in case of quick@@ ening of the &amp; DVI ; viewers not for@@ ged , there may be a mistake , this should be displayed in the log file or in the news window summ@@ ari@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; the log file contains the error source in the source text . in the editor can be used to view the fl@@ amm@@ able La@@ TeX errors and nuts error . the log file is always the line , in which the error appears , must be cli@@ cked down to the error in the log file and a k@@ ile ; navig@@ ating to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once you click on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template used for the document . &quot;
&quot; when selecting le@@ ak document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard to the fast creation of a new document . more information can be included in the section . &quot;
&quot; temporary users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates , created and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
to create a new template must be created either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; -@@ file bl@@ amed or create a new file .
&quot; when creating a new document , a template using file New will be replaced with other data ( e.g. name or string coding ) . these variables can be set up in settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are to be replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ C@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into documents . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ $ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ C@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and hence the commands of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template will be performed instead of default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . will be a simple way to create a template , should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) can be done in the menu tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; out .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate , and to experience its possibilities , the manual is to be taken to Kate . user of &amp; k@@ ile ; can work there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; Kate ; start . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ instruction reference , which can be called the available description of La@@ TeX documents . you can get a detailed description of nearly all commands , which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use it as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ click with penet@@ rated Str@@ g button , to fix the &amp; tex ; word , meaning that in this way , clicking on \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par full . &quot;
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with penet@@ rated lin@@ ker , the full text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
when using the arrow buttons with penet@@ rated tran@@ sh@@ alt taste can be used parts of the source text in the editors window .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; for example , the mon@@ eti@@ fication of various types of source texts to search and these emerge . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex works ; -@@ commands of the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
many assist@@ ants can be char@@ med . this is a separate type of book@@ marks inside the text . they also acc@@ entu@@ cky the jump to n@@ Ã ¤ n@@ Ã ¤ den or the corresponding key@@ note that it is automatically used in the first input of a drawing automatically .
&quot; the editing is probably one of the main aspects in setting up a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already outstanding options are added to writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special orders for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special orders for their selection . under Edit@@ ing excer@@ pts , the following commands may contain : &quot;
w@@ Ã ¤ h@@ lt includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines that included on both sides a blank line ) . this enhanced significance is not included in the table below ( as in other text edit@@ ors ) . these extended meaning slept with it . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the copies are separated by two blank lines .
&quot; the word under the current C@@ urs@@ or@@ position . this selection has also an extended meaning , since this command also contains a lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a white star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for example , a part of the document may be removed from this first and by pressing the button de@@ pot ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; me@@ ile ; offers its own instruction for a faster result . under Edit@@ ing Ent@@ removal are the following commands to contain : &quot;
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition of a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of mach@@ ining excer@@ pts paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments can play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile offers further orders under mach@@ ining surroundings for a most powerful work with &amp; lat@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; with this command becomes the beginning of the current setting ( no matter where the current position is ) , the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the command to be placed in the area . &quot;
&quot; with this command , to the end of the current setting ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to the chim@@ ney of the surroundings . &quot;
if the c@@ ursor before or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } is found at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many wast@@ ed environment commands can be quickly lost , the most recently ge@@ oning environment , so that the wel@@ ded environmental structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . among collabor@@ ators TeX @-@ group are a few important commands , those from mach@@ ining environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the se@@ pul@@ ling cl@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; with this command , the end of the current group is split ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp . &quot;
when the c@@ ursor before or behind the soft fl@@ amm@@ ers of a &amp; tex ; group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many wast@@ ed groups @-@ brack@@ ets can soon be lost , the most recently rec@@ alled group , so that the wel@@ ded structure of the &amp; tex ; groups do not destroy . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex , there are two simple instructions used as gifts . for the purpose of implementing it is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and add two close contact for lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double panel characters can set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ TeX em@@ - and will be sign@@ alled .
you can also use L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or fran@@ tic can be used as well .
&quot; in Dr@@ Ã ¼ ck of Shift ; En@@ umer@@ ate &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent lin@@ len@@ um@@ ance . if the current position within a lists -@@ environment ( such as en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) is , for example a po@@ len@@ eck , but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
inside a tables environment close t &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an near po@@ len@@ um@@ ck .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to be supported ; setup ... La@@ TeX
&quot; some users m@@ ns the columns in tables , environments , and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate , already having a good source code , it has been installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; to add special commands ( mostly for different modes ; ) these are three according to the need and the other two are available for automatic compensation . all these modes can set up ... complete . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment with the command \ \ begin { surroundings } will &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when Dr@@ Ã ¼ ck , the last letter of the entry is removed and may be mis@@ understood . on the other hand , the list by entering another letter can also be smaller . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from selection of a command . alternatively , you can be caught up by &amp; k@@ ile ; also jumping marks , so that a simple jump to these positions are possible by mach@@ ining cou@@ ps N@@ Ã ¤ ste spr@@ ing@@ brand and which can be implemented . &quot;
&quot; setting up the settings , set up ... bo@@ ile ; susp@@ end users can be made to these lists . there can be different types of wine @-@ lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as guar@@ dian frames . &quot;
&quot; the instruction mode is for use of environments not n@@ ests . there are always a few letters to be entered into account , and the call of dec@@ eler@@ ation mode will be used . on the other hand , the environments will be used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for ex@@ propri@@ ation of the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the Dis@@ claimer mode via the complete environment or the ke@@ eper Alt + Shift key emp@@ et@@ aste , the command to be inserted automatically and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be continued on the simpl@@ est manner and can be termin@@ ated by pressing the input . &quot;
&quot; once this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; real@@ ises that it is a lists environment and is even a first \ \ item command with one . &quot;
&quot; setting up the settings , set up ... bo@@ ile ; susp@@ end up settings to these lists are being made . this mode uses the use of dec@@ eler@@ ation mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; for user @-@ defined lists of copies , which can be replaced immediately by L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ g@@ ere strings . the lists can be set in exam@@ ple@@ .c@@ wl , for example , the file exam@@ ple@@ .c@@ wl , in which for example , the file L = \ \ La@@ TeX is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word multip@@ lied rec@@ orders or the short@@ cut of Str@@ g + Alt Le@@ et@@ aste , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; there are not helpful for automatic compensation . however , it has been noted that many W@@ Ã ¶ h@@ ers are written in a document more than once . thus offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the distor@@ tion for all already written winding . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the menu @-@ up settings ... K@@ ile Fair@@ ness . here , the swelling can also be specified for the display of comprehen@@ sion . &quot;

&quot; the dialog is designed to be simple as simple as possible . for the view of the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but we offer an excellent basis for use and re@@ productions from pages . if the PDF file is printed , the pages can be arranged using a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are re@@ arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to enable the result of work to be done , the source code must be compiled . all the tools are group@@ ed into the direct creation of comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating . &quot;
for the comp@@ iling of source material for viewer as well as ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or another conversion can be used in the default viewer using old ; 3 ; then the DVI ; -@@ file in a PS file is converted into a PS file and be treated by old ; 5 the PS file .
&quot; when using the command flyer , usually a spect@@ ator will be called after the comp@@ iling . should not be used in an built @-@ in viewer , every new window will be used every time . &quot;
a new project will be introduced to the project New Project .... here the following information is asked for the project :
&quot; when checking the file window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the drilling of EC@@ M@@ AS@@ cript -@@ Ko@@ de . script can be managed in sen@@ k@@ right bar .
the API @-@ scripts are not yet expanded and can be found in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; yet again .
&quot; the first one has to be said that the out@@ sourcing of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) , with the following methods : &quot;
&quot; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly compact system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of suitable packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different aid to support users . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ ex ; are delivered with many documents . they contain a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is ideal for search of a particular form of form@@ atting , but rather it is a huge manual for the search of a particular form@@ atting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ ex ; delivered , the Fin@@ der of the right document offers not always simple . as a real help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ ex ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k that contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and herein . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or stroke . by &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are shown .
&quot; one double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the bed , and the viewer for the document . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source text , which can be consolidated on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ ile ; - and Unix systems ; is also a part of the Fink project , which makes &amp; k@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac , with installed OS @-@ X . &quot;

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their involvement in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use com@@ po@@ unding as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination comes fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has , argu@@ pro@@ c and how over@@ rag@@ ing it is . let &apos;s raise it a piece , we give him a graphic interface ! not more on a terminal ; simply click on the icon for the XML processor and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application is an index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is expected in the same folder . if not , then remove the current working folder and enter the folder folder in the folder of other folder . &quot;
output files will be stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time if the@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as previously said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the newly opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder you can find index@@ .@@ doc@@ book . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to a output on the screen , her file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported mistakes and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the veri@@ fiable file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then , they let the current file be simple . if not , delete it in current file the tick and select the file select file by other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if they only want to know if the file well @-@ formed , they click the Well @-@ formed review selection . &quot;

Ja@@ probably , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; -@@ processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already , then it can be selected , then let the current file choose . if not , remove the selection of the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is to be named , then the file is usually stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plugins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even if the plug @-@ in system will benefit immediately . you can benefit from the additional functionality and need not wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI &apos;s elements . more information can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we start with the menu plug @-@ ins . there@@ with , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all of the plug @-@ ins and adding new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search box . when adding a plug @-@ ins without a memory location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project has several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the disclosure of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project attributes .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identification .
one member can have multiple roles in the project as well as both team leader and sub@@ project manager .
the user can look for himself from the list of team members who he is . this is happening by typ@@ ing the team member from the list and introduces the button as expresses . the currently selected member ( its identi@@ fier ) appears f@@ ett after you are : text .
nickname and setting of their own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for more information about comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team@@ leader , if something specific is happening . see in for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that happens when something specific in the project is done . an example would be the record of opening and closing of the project so that later , a file would be saved , or a script that will enter a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project controls , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email will be sent to the addres@@ see in the recipient list . the addres@@ see can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project manager . see in , wei such lad@@ der will be set up . &quot;
comments are special comments in the documents . you differ from normal comments by the following things :
note : it can be either the note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by a text text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the role of the team leader in the following possibilities : team manager : project manager in the field or sub@@ project names should be stated as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nickname and roll names are independent of large or small @-@ write , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting , the DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic is and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here are only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta ... called . diesel dialog extends over a few pages that are dealt with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; on tags including auto@@ completion . the entries are :
&quot; large / small number of tags : large / small @-@ write of tags . normal Large / small @-@ tender means , the tags are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / small @-@ off of attributes : large / small @-@ write of automatically used attributes . normal Large / mini@@ ature means , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically conclude : when raised , it is optional for tags for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; attached . &quot;
not op@@ tion@@ ale tags automatically close : as above for all other tags except for the simple tags .
&quot; start and finish day automatically update : when switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic awakening of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the appropriate coding during the entry .
&quot; M@@ IME types : Mim@@ e@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the Standard Standard , the default values can be restored . &quot;
standard string coding : the coding of newly created or in other ways as with file opening files ( where the coding of the file may be over@@ looked ) . this setting here will be engra@@ ved by the same in the project Properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; DT@@ D @-@ DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this attitude here will be considered by the same in the project Properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that in a electricity loss or crash at the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as the stor@@ ing of the file . also , it is not the same as the stor@@ ing documents , a backup is regularly created , according to the time displayed . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or in one &apos;s view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ el ) , which makes it possible to see the documentation , the announcement and the source text at the same time . &quot;
transl@@ ator the window settings on the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface made by changing the M@@ DI mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command parameters .
the warning messages range serves the taxes of the possibility to un@@ check the display of war@@ nings through an@@ ho@@ oks of non more inquiries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change it is the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization of V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in the divided mode . in terms of various modes see .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the representation of the par@@ ser @-@ k@@ not in the document , into details . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse click on the struc@@ turing , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the field of structural @-@ tree settings , the visibility of knots in the tree , the actu@@ ality of the tree in the mach@@ ining and how deep can be opened in changing the structural changes automatically . blank no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while blank groups are such , in which the current document was not found . &quot;
&quot; the area to forti@@ fication of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) to be un@@ folded in groups , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it means that it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ oul ac@@ ron@@ ym is something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins you can manage the plug @-@ ins . plugins are K@@ part @-@ applications of d@@ third side , which can be used by each K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be following : &quot;

&quot; input : this information is handed over to the plugin , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in the &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin den@@ ies the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to refuse the store , if this option is not selected . &quot;

&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting was completely new . Di@@ e@@ Support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was implemented as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of which a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented , the various Impl@@ ement@@ ations of plug @-@ ins . &quot;
currently only a plugin is available to support the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug @-@ in table you can change the specific settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view that is displayed in the contents of monitoring variables . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view , in which all attitudes , numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is usually shown in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or she shares the plugin to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ y demands . this action is created by default when a project is opened , allowing a de@@ bu@@ gger that must not be respected in normal case . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session Star@@ ter the session . exclu@@ des the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the sounds following requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to the server to trigger a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to see the current document . the issue of this requirement is shown in the view de@@ bu@@ gger issue .
&quot; de@@ bug@@ ging the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script , and detailed information about the surveillance variables as well as the currently carried out on line . when this happens , the script is continued , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without information on surveillance variables and the current view number . if this happens when a script is stopped , the execution begins , the execution begins as soon as a requirement is placed . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next directive in the script without responding to the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next directive in the script whenever possible in functions and includes parts .
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to go the statement and go to the next , as if there is the current one . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , the monitoring is to be monitored . the surveillance value appears in the variable view . &quot;
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to suit your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to become better .
document type E@@ di@@ tier@@ pack@@ ete ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to provide support for mark@@ eters and scrip@@ ting languages ; your simplicity and flexibility makes out of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; B &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up @-@ languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are made of two parts , the day folder and the tool@@ bar . day @-@ folder are handy , symbo@@ lic@@ ally sty@@ lists of imaging ( above the E@@ di@@ tier window ) , the text and instructions made faster in a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details on the conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; c@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also work@@ bar . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property di@@ alog@@ es , which shows &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . work@@ ings enable a fast inser@@ ting tags into a document without risk of a writing . &quot;
&quot; day folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; # p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day @-@ folder are named the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the equ@@ in@@ XML and de@@ pressed if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is laid out in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a t@@ XML document . it can only be found once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type over itself otherwise . &quot;
the type of tags is a script feature . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument in function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type meth@@ od valid . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute and the attributes within that day can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is a only element type element .
&quot; describe a attribute of a tags . this item can only be noted for every attribute . in addition , there will be other tags , descri@@ bing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element item . &quot;
returns the source code used for the attributes of the Day @-@ Edit@@ or@@ dialog and in the attribute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p Metho@@ den@@ name is used within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a chi@@ pping and a method name . the arguments that can be handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag which group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur for a attri@@ but@@ able description only once . it is a only @-@ elementary type element .
determine the position of the attribute for a tags within a dialogue . this day may occur for every attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the item is empty .
indicates the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
indicates a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a single element type .
gives a list of elements that will end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ coding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly sto@@ cked and closed .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything , but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; , and some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this feature is currently not available . currently , the check occurs only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; Editor &gt; element of the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ coding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; function &quot; function = &quot; string &quot; function = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; c@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor to be accessed via DT@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite DT@@ D settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D HTML 4.01 / / EN ) Nickname = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname . &quot;
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click on New Action results in the same dialogue :
&quot; this promotion is designated ke@@ yp@@ ass . with clicking the user interface , a short@@ cut can be al@@ located ; with one of one , the current keyboard interface can be removed . &quot;
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be entered a text in the det@@ a@@ illed settings and inserted in the execution of the action on the current c@@ ursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can change external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , the quick start -@@ dialogue or the various See in ... promotions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running ; this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the external script is used .
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the aforementioned methods , a script can be displayed by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the standard entry . in the selection field entry can be defined , which is to send to the default file . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document will be sent to the script . the % input is normally only with this setting .
&quot; accordingly , the output of the exec@@ uting application can also be re@@ directed . there are two kinds of output : normal output written on the standard version ; bug fixes , to the default issue written , which is to be specified with which the default issue is set to : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add actions and configure options . select Settings promotions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the day to the appropriate material .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes , and you plan their use , activate the dialog &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; if available , so that a entering when the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit : use by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the provided symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the tag start , I decided to create a laun@@ cher as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as los , rigi@@ d , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled ; start tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbols , it must still be connected with the action . this happens over the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text box there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the apply button and continue with other tags , so there is still what is , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some custom@@ ization &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should set it into a better overview of several separ@@ ators in several groups . make sure that the tool@@ bar set up into multiple groups . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; I want to choose the den@@ omin@@ ator ( quite the left above ) for my work@@ bar . after selecting the element , the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick option to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the den@@ omin@@ ator will not support group@@ ing . someone who do not know my work@@ ings , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Kno@@ pf is the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ ving all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; back in the correct folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be im@@ ple folder , but your work@@ bar ( s ) should be saved in the correct folder ( n ) you should be loaded in the correct folder ( n ) if a file is opened of the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the not@@ e@@ worthy expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentary tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you must leave the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second we treat here . &quot;
&quot; # KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , to the D@@ Oc@@ um@@ entation Report 2 = # Sec@@ .@@ en.html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2@@ .html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2@@ .html &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example you can see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation in such a way :
&quot; # KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element PHP 4.2 Speci@@ fication = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = index.html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = In@@ tro@@ duction , ... basic syntax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ... &quot;
notice the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own contents . there is no known border for the chess tel@@ ung@@ es ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the content directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and in consequence at the upper end of the man@@ ure &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything but watch out &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resources @-@ end@@ at@@ r@@ ots will be replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed for the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script for the context of the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array , the documentation would be shown directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( content list ) and the file @-@ free head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated @-@ separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / share / apps / doc / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global usage . then create a folder ( as stated in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure that this good and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to use the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to be working with the best we@@ aving platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the res@@ ist resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ boxes with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise to whom . at different places there is an email address , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email to send , the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and used only if our team needs them as accurate and usable for publication . to ensure a user &apos;s resources , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked after their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys you may need to have a look . in the dialogue New resource can be empty ) and with click on OK the upload will be launched . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can upload from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to upload , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installing , exam@@ ines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by testing the integrity and signature . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages that is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files can be needed in the tag@@ XML format . there is the simpl@@ est way to convert an DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started by the DT@@ D shop and Conver@@ t of a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . afterwards the following dialogue appears :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defini@@ tions : the string that is in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Day as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
&quot; setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion , when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; to p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are a few key concepts . to understand this and get full benefit from our fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them precisely these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefits . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction also involves a number of components in qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . by work@@ pieces of actions it is all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administr@@ ators to secure different tool@@ boxes , actions and patterns in the global tree , which can then be available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and work@@ pieces . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to work specifications specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder @-@ tree of the project , resulting in common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editors window , the building views , the box with information and the tool@@ bar . please hit , and for further information on these fields . &quot;
&quot; you can click the cart@@ el with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current docum@@ enting entries , such as close the current , other or all boxes , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; legal cli@@ pping in the Edit@@ ors lead to another context menu regarding the processed document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing of under the mouse c@@ ursor or opening of the file , when the string is described under the mouse c@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Edit@@ ors . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bar is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ bar will be adapted to the new functions and related services . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; you wish to insert the symbol that the day represents , then you can insert the data for this just added day . if you want to insert a day that has several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate them and ro@@ am . in the presentation of boxes for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , and documentation construction views are available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that puts &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; prepared this view lists all files in the project and allows the vulner@@ ability of files in the project using right mouse @-@ click . actions such as adding , de@@ code , upload or del@@ e@@ asing the files from the medium medium can be performed with the text menu . &quot;
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all options open to you . &quot;
templates can be divided into three categories depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only available to the respective users and templates in projects are available only in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the spin in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can send the available information to a script . via the right mouse button , more functions are available , such as the script to boot , edit or send with email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ clicking of an element , the c@@ ursor in the document is placed on the position of the element . it opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree will appear under the other building views . with it can change some quickly attributes , and nam@@ esp@@ ace . it allows the content of a specific inser@@ tion system , the modification of all available attributes with a few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the Web @-@ Technik for your development . it can be downloaded from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be able to create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc for a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two boxes at the bottom of the window can be reached via the usable information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this cart@@ el shows information about each in Qu@@ anta current script , such as the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are shown . &quot;
&quot; this cart@@ el shows all mistakes in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ script , which are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ pieces are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the work@@ bar is the possibility to define own orders as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define . &quot;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as com@@ pressing T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they can provide a tool@@ bar in an email ; like any other secure and load @-@ up !
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has given a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and do not run here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before their own folder . the same is valid for &amp; Q@@ t ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a Web @-@ development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus was optimized for a quick Web development , combined with a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions . &quot;
&quot; while effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor to create , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an in@@ ital idea , what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus was ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web @-@ development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; not longer on r@@ ally &amp; HTML , limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : when you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this , the appropriate &amp; IDE should be . &quot;
&quot; well , to the above claim needs to be recorded , that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , as to expand users and developers , as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; quality &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows Web@@ Develop@@ ers to boost the use of intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . through the program Com@@ peti@@ tions they can get &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; expand , without getting any script lingu@@ alism to remember . ( more about it can be found in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development , and has quickly expanded to an mature editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more into the details of this documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in the con@@ quer@@ or , enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta execute ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and super@@ vised by Eric Laf@@ fo@@ on sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia , anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time , when you open a file that is not located , whereby the oldest entry is out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . take a look at the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project inspection folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts to the inser@@ tion from the cli@@ p@@ board there are showing special characters to the &amp; HTML , so that they are displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as a form of form@@ atting . &quot;
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ Cl@@ othing that is the correct way to insert specific characters and spaces in the URL ; s . primarily used to include &amp; URL ; s into the anchor day .
switch the block@@ sel@@ ections or off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; taste .
&quot; go directly to a po@@ ison number . this is very helpful , if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages ! &quot;
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the news window and not on . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; initial and un@@ lock of the problem of the problem at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem @-@ re@@ por@@ ter is activated , once you switch to the structural tree . &quot;
displays the symbols left from the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ mark with a mouse click .
&quot; when reading book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the C@@ urs@@ ors in the document . &quot;
book@@ mark from other printed documents appear in the menu group@@ ed after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
open an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the fil@@ es@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to add files to the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory to new files that could be there , e.g. graphics files in your project folder or a sub@@ folder , and then add it to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded other inputs / output emo@@ du@@ le ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects you can find the details .
loads of a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project yourself / tool@@ bars and are only stored in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; a dialog to save your work@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar , local or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved through settings , or you will be asked to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; remo@@ ves a tool@@ bar from the visibility range . delet@@ es it not from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you are asked if you want to do this . &quot;
&quot; with this , you can send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; enables the transfer of materials to the main server , where everyone can access it . &quot;
invite one &amp; DT@@ D ; who made you or anyone else made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own descri@@ p@@ tive format .
&quot; loading of the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to renew , without the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is global and a writing in the global KDE folder is not present , failed the store . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently charged work@@ pieces . if the standard tab is loaded , there are in the tags menu a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates and de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is refused when this day in this place is ref@@ uted to the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the above menu points . click on it . click on a activated plug @-@ in de@@ activated . &quot;
select the syn@@ tax@@ able surface mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ on schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ates ; -@@ version .
&quot; choose the type of display identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to wrap . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of the user interface . thanks to some limitations in the KDE library , the shut@@ down sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the box mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which is the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu for each open sub@@ window includes an entry . with selection of an entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
turns the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window of or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affects every application , using the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
judge the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialogue appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or which can add and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help in accordance with the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor , but it is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; quality &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free lic@@ enced , but as with every Open Source project developers can always support the developers . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , you will find the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out best from top to bottom , for example after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project shall be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features can be adjusted later . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example foo . when entering the name file , file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine , where you want to access a local data . either a name ( host@@ name e.@@ ple@@ .de ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; makes this field empty , the default settings of the selected log file is used . depending on setting the remote computer could be an adjustment needed . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates for the project will be saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . when a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set out rather than the standard . &quot;
this allows to add files from the local file system to the project . it can be selected several files or whole folder .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static content , which you can download and change . if you do it , you do not have to go differently . &quot;
&quot; permit , if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be integrated . if a project is started again , not an@@ ho@@ oks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folder are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of vou@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by an@@ ho@@ oks , or by removing the tick , cl@@ ing out of the project . &quot;
the latest screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project @-@ properties in the sub@@ window profiles in the sub @-@ window profiles or with the short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional items are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ card is possible ) which can be re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to above , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view that will be loaded when opening the project . in more information about project views can be read .
&quot; thus , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed is found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the button options . in the event the bug is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles , high @-@ load profiles can be set ( see in ) as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile , by adding an own construction view to each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be edited , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event , one can switch an event @-@ actions and add these actions to change or delete it . event operations are executed , if a previously specific event occurs , such as the secure file . look into the details . &quot;
&quot; by default opens up &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project , which was opened . this behavior can not be influenced . &quot;
to open another project select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving ; changed files . same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project management gives free access to the files in the project . you can manage the files in the current project .
&quot; folders and folders are also lacking , however the entries are missing and open with ... in with the right mouse @-@ click context menu : &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the location of the high @-@ upload files . &quot;
&quot; enables the removal of the current profile . if only more a profile is present , the button will end to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password is kept in the nucle@@ us and is forgotten in the programmer . this possibility is useful when common up@@ loading files need to be needed and the rather un@@ secure password on the disk will not be saved .
&quot; this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog , if you change your opinion from the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ level profiles are created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to various servers . in the processing or creation of a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; to choose file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can not be easily read , but everybody with programming knowledge can be easily seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bar . it is possible to give many views in a project , i.e. by simply ex@@ changing the view , various files and work@@ pieces can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , stored by settings of tool@@ bar @-@ tool@@ bar , opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bar in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best about the menu tool@@ bar work@@ bar . use and execution differ . the addition of tool@@ bar is dealt with in the section &quot; &quot; Add of tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the work@@ pieces and the symbols are to be adjusted either via the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with new action , create a new tool@@ bar , may remove other actions such as tool@@ bar , which can be specified in dialogue where actions can be specified on this or other tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will remove the action and displayed action , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the work@@ bar and the actions on them can set up with settings in the menu with settings ... and setting actions .. set .
&quot; templates are included in essential documents , code cut@@ lets and files to connect . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used in principle as a common file system with exten@@ dable organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any of the existing folder in the pre @-@ storage facility . templates are available in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in approximately the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ es@@ ystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided arrangements have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each submission conditions before using it .
&quot; binary is everything not pur@@ er text is . it can be inserted any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary , are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ storage area below global templates . further information about templates tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created from any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple sc@@ af@@ folding for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate ways to be efficiently . some examples can be found in the pros below global templates . see in more information about templates . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful , if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template but the same text area always included in the documents . some examples are found in the pre @-@ storage system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . see in more information about templates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , serve these templates for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organised in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a com@@ pressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a documentary structure for Beli@@ eving ( XML ; , &amp; HTML , , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select file As templates store as templates store as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once that has happened , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project file ) the template is not visible in the project tree . take a look at the templates under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File Download as templates , store select as local / project position . alternatively , the selection can simply be drag@@ ged with drag@@ ging and racks to the construction of the templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary systems is simple : the file can only be used in a pre @-@ storage folder , so all the file management functions can be used , such as pul@@ ling and racks or inser@@ ting over the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click in the file tree or in the project files tree view to one folder on the right and secure site template , select a name for the template and secure . by default , it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented advance . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ prints , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , files or connect with them . in addition , one can keep some things in use in projects very profound in mind . &quot;
the pre @-@ storage structure in the sub@@ window Tem@@ plates is based on the files found in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta .
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder view , click the folder view of the folder and select the context menu features . the following dialogue will appear : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is cancelled , as soon as elli@@ p@@ tive attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and adap@@ table to everything except the stem cell cards . if a stem folder would basically dis@@ abling this path , except if a regular folder would appear to appear . if nothing appears , one probably appears in a regular folder . &quot;
permits the text @-@ lines or foot@@ ed text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ head@@ lines for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er a whole presentation already with the right head@@ lines / foot@@ prints .
&quot; in addition , you have a text menu ( on display , right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor used by the menu view . the first mode replaces the source code into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor &apos;s editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a c@@ ursor . then one can edit and turn on if needed changes in the V@@ PL ; editor will be visible in the source code .
&quot; when working with V@@ PL ; editor in a document , which contains a small green symbol of V@@ oh@@ and@@ a of &amp; PHP ; to edit it . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time changes both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor &apos;s editor are visible and the c@@ ursor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron is active , this mode is already active , puts the button @-@ pressure the active c@@ ursor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set up via settings qu@@ anta .... After the option of V@@ PL ; it can be automatically set between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . basically the recommendation applies : a small r@@ anne for fast computer and a big sp@@ anne for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be accessed as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be called for a new document with the V@@ PL ; it is used to modify the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags , the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click in the list allows the change of content , such as keywords on the column names and key@@ word key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content -@@ column . &quot;
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons below the list or delete . the modification of CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style situation by pressing on the file button and choose the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , made possible by filling with the arrows . under rare circumstances the c@@ ursor occurs . the mark@@ ings works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing or del@@ e@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is made in the same way over the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor , made . it is observed that the inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags . e.g. when an anchor day , each other surrounding anchor needs to be removed . &quot;
some work@@ pieces such as the tables assist@@ ent or the lists assistant are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists work@@ pieces must be used .
&quot; &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of style templates . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style of style can be prosec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already exists . &quot;
&quot; hold in a template , in a place in one of x@@ sl@@ db@@ g charged Stil@@ m@@ - or x@@ ml file or at the current knots . new in x@@ sl@@ db@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db @-@ compatibility mode can be put in a specific file and po@@ len@@ ght number and will be activated later . &quot;
x@@ sl@@ db@@ g contains the complete path of a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path@@ way . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the top loaded tim@@ es.@@ x@@ sl@@ db@@ g is an example loaded with relative path to work folder .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is the following entry is possible :
&quot; in this command , a partial or all agreement with a pre @-@ name named Q@@ N@@ AME or a given model name checks . &amp; eg ; template agre@@ es with each Q@@ N@@ AME , which contains the string template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; &quot; Q@@ N@@ AME &quot; &quot; is extended according to the rules that is defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace specified in the X@@ SL @-@ source file . X@@ SL : test@@ 1 will be expanded to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;

there are many graphic tools for compar@@ isons . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
&quot; the meeting was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ory many changes made and at the same time had corrected the thro@@ ws . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in merge . &quot;
&quot; I used the program used by me only the changed lines , but I could not see what has changed within these lines . and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the single back had changed . these changes have been a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , could display differences within one line and changes to white signs . later , many more useful features have been added . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare text , just copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the compar@@ ative window . &quot;
&quot; a function made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons , and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ original file browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ way merge will be fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of each other at a piece of co@@ de work and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps the failure of conflicts and shows the result at the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screenshot shows three quantum files at the same time :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you with the compar@@ isons and merge complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder @-@ together :
&quot; and diff@@ use 3 ; shows the exact differences and den@@ ces the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you often have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences between white signs and t@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines are visible only in a certain number of white characters , one can see a look at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble changes when J@@ em@@ and is changing . ) &quot;
&quot; when a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the colour indicates which file is different . red color means that both files are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files are in the same name , but in different folders , you can simplify your pet work by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
&quot; open @-@ dialog offers the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting via the file browser ( file ... ) or select a most recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you have the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files will be executed . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ isons and merge of folders . if for A file is selected , then used &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if cancelled , the input field is active for target and can process it . however , it is not necessarily required to define immediately a output of output . you can get this step later on saving . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialogue with settings . here you can specify options before you start with the compar@@ isons / .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to choose text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in open dialogue , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the break button . &quot;
you can also use to@@ es and racks : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let him fall over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you &apos;d only need two appropriate files to copy them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you can easily copy the relevant sections simply , insert and then compare . &quot;
note : currently you cannot draw nothing out &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the dro@@ pping of text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the drag@@ ging and de@@ generation of text into another program , as cut and inser@@ tion ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such a case your original data might be lost . &quot;
&quot; the upper part of each text window is the info @-@ line . the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the index number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that the window is optional . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three sources are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one sees at the color , which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( together to guide ) well . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the composition column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding colour . in case of differences , white characters is not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) B. white characters are not so important only in strings and comments , for the Pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the combination column of text , is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the po@@ stage file is activated , the line is dot@@ ted to the surrounding lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the compar@@ ative windows ) also has an info @-@ line with the record issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; modified &#93; if you have done the result . usually it contains through the automatic together already text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ solved , the saving disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons Spr@@ inge to next stem / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ ative windows can be used , each difference is also a conflict which has to be resolved manually . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also be a jump from the position in the windows where the start of the group would not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the colour background color for current sector and each other appears on the left appears a black beam .
&quot; sometimes , by automatic shut@@ down or by manu@@ elles no further line stays more in the group ; then one row is displayed in the file ; one row is displayed in the source . this text appears either in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might copy and wei@@ gh@@ ed elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ als ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources , ignore the options below or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly to the images and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you use in one of the window , you can use the arrow buttons , right , finish , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the Aug@@ ab@@ ef@@ en@@ ster , you can also use the other keys to editing . with the inser@@ tion button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ writing mode . ( default is the insert mode ) . &quot;
a click with the left mouse button into one of the CV@@ S columns containing the view of all windows to the start of each group ( as already in the section guide and the ed@@ itable out@@ box was explained ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ bottom / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ stream ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , they must still be resolved as a conflict . therefore , it must be distinguished between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ inser@@ tion ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark , automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board copies , because you could be acci@@ dentally transmitted to the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; lin@@ len@@ ders are stored according to the primary operating system . Unix @-@ variants use a po@@ len@@ vor@@ ship \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the po@@ len@@ ders of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use with bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved and restored when the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog shows also fonts with adjust@@ . width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are presented in kur@@ si@@ ver script . if the selected Scrip@@ tures does not support this representation does not happen at all . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be cleared . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically displays an un@@ just color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , the wir@@ ing of the tab@@ ulator button is inserted the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a t@@ ulator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when entering or return , the inser@@ tion of the previous line is automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , each selection will automatically be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board falls . &quot;
you can select which index @-@ type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection of the used operating system .
&quot; in the compar@@ isons of files you tried to find all identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white signs are ignored . the second step for@@ es each line . in this step white signs are not ignored . even when together , white signs will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a wagon test &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , other again save only one po@@ len@@ ders &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored the wagon badge , but then they might be variable with different sizes on the side @-@ side comparison , however , as a white sign must be disabled . during the default , this option has to be disabled . in the default setting this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , figures and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result the differences are shown , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences . the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very big files . &quot;
&quot; in Autom@@ atic @-@ continuing mode , this attitude determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflicts will continue . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ sol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file in a source . ( default is manual choice . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you just need it from time to time , then use the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options ignore numbers or ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . &quot;
these options are dealt with in the chapter to scanning folders and through a con@@ duction . look for details under documentation for the list comparison and con@@ duction .
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version will be attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a back@@ up@@ file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any further backup . &quot;
&quot; change the user interface . change this option does not affect the current current program . you need to end and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language there is global about the control centre . ) &quot;
the following di@@ version settings may be set separately for each entry . if this option is activated for all entries the upper setting is used .
&quot; in the selection fields for the coding , a short notice is what the local en@@ coding is . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file coding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpret . as the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and combined with different en@@ coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding is to be used to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code . ) With this option you can specify the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
&quot; turn this off to supp@@ ress the curtains of changes in white characters in the text or view page . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color @-@ di@@ fied over@@ t column . but sometimes you want to see only the differences between two of three files . -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed beside the normal nor a second over@@ t column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
orders the compar@@ isons window next to each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines of useful . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together . a simple click will start together , and use the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as a pre @-@ called name for output files . ( if this function is used to re @-@ perform once again , the name of the last used output will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , they first handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own Pre@@ processor that matches exactly your needs . you can use this function for example to cut @-@ out parts or to correct the return . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command processor is used only . you can write your own processor command , which matches exactly your requirements . each entry line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to enable the user more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external programme is needed , and most users do not want to program yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely suff@@ ice . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the entry into large letters : sed &apos; s / \ \ &apos; . * \ \ ) / \ \ &apos; / \ \ &apos; / \ &apos; . * \ \ \ &apos; / \ &apos; \ &apos; . \ \ 1 : the found text in the first cl@@ amp @-@ string . \ \ U trans@@ forms the found text in big letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key@@ word to automatically created drawing strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . the \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) . \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ ) .
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you might like these regular phrases even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ign@@ oring of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in ket@@ e@@ 3 . however , it is good as an example for a further processing command for lin@@ len@@ eck . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , thus virtually er@@ ased . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several conditions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other .
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something different like perl . perl -@@ p -@@ E &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ ror / switches &apos; allergy are required with perl some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs perl only ( and ) without the request &quot; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
&quot; the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for viewing and assem@@ bling . further operations changes only the data , which the po@@ len@@ ght @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the po@@ len@@ ght pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal Pre@@ processor . as input . &quot;
&quot; the premis@@ e commands are very useful , but like with every function , the text changes or differences , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ sively compare and merge . &quot;
... do you make a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start .
... can simul@@ ate the simul@@ ate and displays the simul@@ ated changes without them really carry out
... &quot; takes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and merge of single files very similar . you only need to open folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folder are assembled , then folder 1 is used as base . if no target folder is used , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not start together . to select the menu item or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during the reading of the folder you will inform you a small news window about the current progress . if you ab@@ ort the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed until then they were compared . &quot;
&quot; when the scanning of the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and each folder of the scan was found during the scan will be shown here in a tree . you can choose an object using a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually shown together . you can click on a folder by clicking on the + / - or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu features two functions all sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories , with which you can assign to all folders and folders . &quot;
&quot; click on a file , the file will start @-@ up and it appears a compar@@ ative window . &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the dat@@ at@@ ype in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the dat@@ at@@ ype is different in the other folder , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object . in such a case the squee@@ zing action will not be automatically elected . if that is launched , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above image , be used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder are considered to be identical if their whole content is identical . then also folder , the same color . at folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a bul@@ letin again , which is only green , then yellow is and later when it is old . &quot;
... &quot; A and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if a file and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting objects exist . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if a file and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such fl@@ ex@@ ual objects exist , this cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folder and no explicit target folder is indicated , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ize . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that both folder are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B do not exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after the merge copies / k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folder are assembled and the option new file will take place , then exam@@ ines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file to the copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical . Sol@@ ange such mistakes can not be eliminated , this can merge the folder not started . &quot;
&quot; during that run , a file will be processed after the other . it &apos;s Status column shows he@@ an when it came together successfully , and according to other messages when something infin@@ ity occurred , you should check out a final test and see whether the status is OK . &quot;
&quot; if in furnis@@ hing dialog file full @-@ permanent analysis is selected , ket@@ e@@ 3 further columns will display . these contain the number un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only be shown when three folder are compared or combined . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either run the currently selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all inter@@ play activities ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can merge this . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a target folder , then it is used in the three @-@ folder mode , when you choose two @-@ folder , B as target chosen and used to sync A and / or B as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries will be displayed in the target structure , also in the folder structure . there are some options due to the particular entries . check these options to avoid un@@ reliable surprises : &quot;
to combine all entries : select Direc@@ tions / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to carry out only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conf@@ lic@@ ting data types still exist invali@@ d actions , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you perform all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options to run , simul@@ ate and break . &quot;
select simul@@ ate if you would only want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all promotions .
&quot; default 3 ; then causes certain actions with all entries . when a manual procedure is needed ( merge a single file ) , then a pop @-@ up window opens ( note the screenshot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are ready to start with a file , select a directory guide / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialogue appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , you &apos;ll see a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that will assist you to select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in another way before you continue with the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually mer@@ ged , take a look at &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them together at the later date . even if this entry has been assembled or not saved , these entries will be done as done . only if you change the mer@@ ging action , these entries will be re @-@ assembled . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ assem@@ bling with these options :
only files that are specified on the specified pattern will be displayed in the elementary tree . you can separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * . folder must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders correspond to this pattern , do not appear in the elementary tree . it can be more than one pattern being entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ating sig@@ nia : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders correspond to this pattern , do not appear in the elementary tree . it can be more than one pattern being entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ating sig@@ nia : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many autonomous files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file can be adjusted . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a code attribute . in other file systems a default score indicates a file as hidden . this option allows you to decide whether these files are to be displayed in the sub@@ tree or not . this option is switched on to the default . &quot;
&quot; with links to files : when the option is off , symbolic links are compared . when the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in the default . &quot;
&quot; in case of links to folder : when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are dealt with . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ ring files . a link to a folder containing a link on itself would lead to a continuous loop and dis@@ per@@ ed . ) This option is off in the default . &quot;
&quot; introduces a complete analysis of each file and displays statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , uns@@ ol@@ ved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files which will not contain text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; when you compare big folder via a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the ch@@ angel@@ ist and the file size . however , this speed item will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched to the default setting . &quot;
there is no real comparison with the ch@@ angel@@ ist . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this option can be useful when copying the ch@@ ill@@ ation date . please use caution . this option is switched to the default setting .
&quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode when two folder are compared and no target folder . in this mode , the proposals for assembled are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is regarded as uns@@ ure because the other file has not been altered . you should consider this in any case . ) This option is switched on in any case . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced by another , then the original version will be ren@@ amed , then the extension .@@ original file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , this will also affect the normal backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , this option does not only incorporate the merge folder . this option is switched on to the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder in connection will lead to collapse of individual files ; you can switch to the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch off the window directory and text window to switch off the window and text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file using double @-@ click . nevertheless , you can create a single file directly , without having to run the folder , the status will be installed and the file will not run again when you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost , if you read the directory again : directory -@@ menu : re @-@ read &quot;
&quot; KDE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folder for opening files on local or remote computers . &quot;
the first command line is compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line is compar@@ es a folder within a zi@@ pped archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax to local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
&quot; a path may be relatively red . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , id@@ mark@@ - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a brief list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder . then , a file is accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility to edit permission or modification date . therefore the cre@@ denti@@ als or modification date from the original . ( note the option confidential of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
&quot; the main purpose for use is currently known as differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts at first the built @-@ in differences . in order to start a diff@@ user , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , takes a patch file in the unified file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . also , please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files have changed since the patch of the patch . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part run , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merge or the compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now Hei@@ st comp@@ are ) is already available . furthermore the name of K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff@@ use 3 of the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GPL @-@ programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by going into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or going to go so .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script should not be communicated to KDE pre@@ fix to KDE . in the pres@@ et installed configure in / usr / local but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject .
&quot; if only the number of white characters different is different , these lines will be treated as identical ; however if only one non @-@ white signs is different , the line is considered not identical . if the lines appear next to each other , this min@@ is , but this par@@ is in the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor can be noticed for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this important information is needed , if the result is simply saved as a text file and there is too much effort to create extra a separate file format , which could save this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too large . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of text should be used to create another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ t ; published and the text will not be extingu@@ ished . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors for the highlight of differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using , and lack the purpose . use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and trou@@ bles@@ hooting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
&quot; for information , as you can use a diff@@ user on other platforms without KDE and can be found on the homepage . &quot;
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE @-@ dir gives you the folder in your system , installed in the KDE . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . however , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ ward ; mail@@ ing@@ lists thereof . &quot;
cutting ( Str@@ g @-@ X or Um@@ ch@@ alt @-@ removal ) copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and delet@@ es the marked text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ ch@@ alt inser@@ tion ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current C@@ urs@@ or@@ position one or replaces the current mark@@ ings .
&quot; differences display : files are identical in all folders and are not in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you have to read changes to these options the folder with the function update . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries displayed , the differences emerge . this also leads to that identical files are not already copied in the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain , they are lacking in a later program version . ) This option is switched on in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for the selection of the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in outcome window ( if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button below . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . Under@@ shifts in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , displays a mini @-@ list of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the areas of work to change their size , finish or move it . this works both within a desktop and on several . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications used in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button you can get windows within walking distance &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other desktop surfaces .
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked , if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only two entries to set up ... and finishing . if however , on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , there is also the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries to minim@@ ise the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual work@@ space . appears only when applied to an application .
&quot; this starter field is marked , window can be moved inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; select this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , display the numbers of virtual work areas ; it is group@@ ed together with name , the names of Ord@@ in@@ al@@ ms are provided , &amp; eg ; 1. work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of every desktop is also shown as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as small windows at &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are shown to enable them to choose from . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window selected . simple icon shows the window with its standard symbol and pix@@ map showing a small view of the real program window . note : pixel map is recommended only for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in some other window managers are known ; horizont@@ ally displays all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal and sen@@ cre@@ cht in a sen@@ cau@@ l@@ right series , which is very good for the display side on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can display in size , the windows as symbols or with its content and shift . furthermore , it works outside the control bar . &quot;
right click within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and then select excer@@ pts from switch to ... provides the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment this cannot be changed in dialog settings , but you can do this manually : &quot;
open the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you don &apos;t have to register as user root or login to your system administrator . in this file you have to register the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and assign to this one value . possible values are :
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of the KDE &apos;s package . &quot;

&quot; if you would like to avoid that the mouse c@@ ursor in the enlarged window , select the c@@ ursor . please note : this is still not able to detect the form of the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor . this is always the standard version ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ Mou@@ se@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse boxes and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse button in the enlarge window and keep the left mouse button de@@ pressed , so you can catch the content of the enlargement window and move . this also goes with the arrows . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; taste press or the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window . &quot;
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . take note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ window will remain and only the lower right corner move .
&quot; you can send a lot of functions . you can then send the enlarged image directly to the printer , into a file ( to insert it later in other applications ) , turning the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the display . the stru@@ ts of the update brings about the needed CPU @-@ times against 0 .
&quot; select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very small , Ger@@ ing , means , high , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will display . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; and km@@ ag , automatically uses your entered short @-@ command to save files , opening a new window , prints , sp@@ ades ( with the button ) again load in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magnific@@ ence and res@@ ent@@ atives &amp; etc . &quot;

&quot; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse c@@ ursor on the same place . it is meant to help people suffering at the R@@ SI syndrome ( re@@ peti@@ tive strain syndrome ) and those of each mouse @-@ click pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , once the mouse c@@ ursor on the same place . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate the re@@ peti@@ tive strain in@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse @-@ click pain . furthermore , it is a bit of exercise . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle pain , which is caused by clicking the mouse and helps to use so many people to merge the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain that can be connected with the use of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to be caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by filling the mouse , is useless . and as in all ergonomic aids : the result can fall for each different . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; super@@ vised your mouse movements and leads a mouse @-@ click if you break the movement shortly .
&quot; if the smart rel@@ oc@@ ating is activated , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it gets the mouse button . move now the mouse , it wa@@ its it until the end of the movement , before the det@@ ach@@ ment requires a little bit of exercise , but you get used quickly on it . &quot;
&quot; this denial must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse @-@ click leads . &quot;
&quot; Int@@ ellig@@ ent is switched on , the shooting of the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button is waiting , when the mouse button is loos@@ ened , when the mouse button is not removed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse @-@ shift . this function is activated by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can shor@@ ten the response time . open this to sound &amp; multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer to shor@@ ten the answer times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at GNO@@ ME or other window environments , please select the respective documentation to find out how to automatically launch a program . &quot;
&quot; sets all settings back to values that were shut down with the opening of the dialogue . have already pushed the button , the settings will be reset at the booth after the last wir@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; on the best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent wir@@ ing should be used to you first . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later get the smart rel@@ oc@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the responses of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect stays : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which does not have a link to un@@ paid reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse rests , you should clean@@ se your mouse . it is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles , which come in touch with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take out the mouse ball . how this happens , it is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be quickly clear if you &apos;re looking at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have the ball remo@@ ves , you would need to see the roles . these are on the sides of the Lo@@ ches , into which the ball was used . the dirt and so@@ iling lets you can easily climb with a flat blade or the finger tab@@ ernacle . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you &apos;ve just begun a shoot in this case , means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by the slogan of the mouse . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using a different window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you yourself perform a mouse @-@ click . here , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset , and you can proceed as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the c@@ ursor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the c@@ ursor to place where you want to have it . however , if you don &apos;t want to create a key@@ note on a neutral area of the desktop , if you are unable to create a key@@ note . safe zones for the mouse c@@ ursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the cover @-@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart rel@@ oc@@ ating , but I did not manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart rel@@ oc@@ ating is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes his time before you want to deal with it . it is very well possible to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or paste it to any other action you want to get into the cli@@ p@@ board . here are some advice on this : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating if you just start to start &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use text instead , keep the mouse button down , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and then enter the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . this is every time when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so , you know exactly when when smart rel@@ oc@@ ating the sho@@ vel time . later you can use the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be used , the X@@ Test @-@ extension must be installed for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and are furnished correctly .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ line is short distor@@ ted . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and those suffering of the mouth @-@ p@@ ains p@@ ains . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that it will be a certain time waiting for a pul@@ ling procedure begins , before the mouse @-@ mouse can be loos@@ ed . in this way the c@@ ess@@ ness and drag@@ ging with the mouse can be performed . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; is a program , with the mu@@ te user to speak their computer for themselves . &quot;
&quot; using the program &amp; km@@ outh , you can let mu@@ te users talk about the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of talking about propositions which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screens ) , enter the command to be used later for the voice version . for more details see the description of the device . &quot;
on the second page you can choose the standard text box . from the text box books you can often use the text tr@@ ays without having to tap into . the text passages can be processed naturally .
&quot; on the third side ( right screenshot ) you determine the dictionary for the vocabulary . &amp; km@@ outh ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each words . in addition , you can read the list of words with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be recorded in the words of the word . &quot;
the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the short@@ cut of your propositions ( the lower white section in the screenshot ) and a ver@@ ge storage of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you have n@@ ym@@ outh ; correctly directed , you can enter into the input field that you want to hear . every promised set is attached to the load storage . you can choose from these propositions which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu @-@ entry Settings km@@ outh ; set up ... open the setup dialog of &amp; km@@ outh . this dialog contains two boxes , voice output , and settings , the page of Wor@@ ker , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the cardboard card , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field please place the character coding , with the text to the language generator will be given . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; knows two species to pass on the text . select the cross field , when the text is supposed to be shared as standard entry to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ line field is not selected , the text is distributed as parameters . you can use the following sites : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to the voice version depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples of this can be found in the App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with as a language service , &amp; km@@ outh is to use as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings on this page is ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d @-@ language service is a stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first drop action action after selecting a text cab , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard or through the choice of a text editing in the menu text box or in the bar for text books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text editor will be directly spoken and added in addition to the dis@@ continued storage . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text editor will be entered only into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection of the edit window , you can specify , whether the text box can be saved automatically with the editing window , when the editing window will automatically be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text box manual is saved the book . if you choose any changes , the text box will not be saved . select on Save Target , will be saved &amp; km@@ outh , ask if the text file is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the listing includes a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window , next to the input field shows &amp; km@@ outh ; a selection field , when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field , you can choose the dictionary that is currently used . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons on the right side , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or export them into a file . below the list you can set the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh ; reads as a result the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by un@@ count of the entry . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , to add just correct words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh , then asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are assembled , and how these weights are to be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; km@@ outh ; newly set words automatically insert within the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main area of the window to the processing of text @-@ pass@@ ag@@ holes is two @-@ split . in the upper part the text profiles are shown as tree @-@ structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text editing , you can change the text editing or the related key@@ note . if you have selected a text box , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new texts or books add or select selected text passages and books , you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a pop@@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text files or text passages , you can change by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Old ; button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut off and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the delay . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text will be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the delay . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the delay . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is executed , a movable tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands display . the tool@@ bar is arranged directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the drag left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is dispos@@ ed , a narrow bo@@ ste in the lower part of the main window with hints on the state of &amp; km@@ outh is displayed when not indicated , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is indicated , a tr@@ ack@@ able p@@ est for text files with entries are displayed . the bar is placed by default on the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ click on the rec@@ kl@@ ed left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
probably you have the command for the voice @-@ issue not correct or not completely entered . open the settings of General settings and insert the command for voice @-@ over@@ s on the map map . ( see map dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer to further details . )
&quot; the festival is a voice @-@ edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows the license to use it free of charge and distribute it without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of command line for setting the voice version , it is thought that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java . currently he only supports the English language generator . currently , it only supports the English language . the license allows it to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; in order to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is thought that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . language version is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must send data as default inser@@ tion . ( this is the recommended example of use Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of Ph@@ on@@ emen into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ lodge the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license permits it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax uses H@@ adi@@ fax to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA can be installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to insert the last sign of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . the full command is therefore more costly than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o @-@ F _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the option data to send data as default one must be switched on .
&quot; the voice @-@ output D@@ äm@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further lingu@@ istic service , which is available for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ over@@ s systems . &quot;
&quot; because the attitude of the language generator can only be performed in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a voice @-@ service as a language service . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the setup dialog of &amp; km@@ outh ; appears , if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; successful to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; needs around 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; a application , with which people who can not speak , can not be able to give text by the machine . it is a list of already saved movements , which the user can always release again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh does not contain language syn@@ thesi@@ zers . on the computer you must be a voice syn@@ thesizer .

&quot; when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ s or long as long as does not have a spokes@@ man , the card @-@ card spokes@@ person will be shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card will be shown . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesi@@ zers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those who are different in volume , syn@@ thesizer , voice , gender , volume , and speed becomes as spokes@@ man . you should at least use a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use the program speed disp@@ ens@@ er otherwise used the default speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to multiple printing table for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the cardboard box leader in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card controller is displayed . this will automatically start automatically when you start the ct@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and still no rec@@ iter . &quot;
all existing speakers will appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on top of the list . the number of speakers is used for voice output if an application does not exist .

the card @-@ card orders is displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD has started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD in order to click on the cardboard box ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website , then check the text that is read , and select in the main menu Tools text . after a short time the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML , are also read and other un@@ visible brands . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate , the extended text@@ editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can first read text read yet . then select the text , which is to be read , and select in the main menu tools text read . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; Kate is embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you can notify you of events by you . you can read the text of this news , also by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up a message when in a IR@@ C channel a message emerg@@ es , in which your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C text message . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ fy , appears a menu item messages in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy are different depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for character strings offer a good opportunity to correct in &amp; kt@@ on ; it is a good example . you removed the tags br and b from the news , the mail sends , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be adopted in most cases than provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; they are not required for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; are filters not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is edited , before going to the program Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace wrong words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to deal with certain fau@@ lts of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of fil@@ tering , it is important to know how the program works &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &quot;
the output of screen @-@ re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be with@@ drawn to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the edition of the Screen reader is pre @-@ read is the added orders continued .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
&quot; messages have the next top priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application , the messages used . while you can see a long text on a website , you can walk with &amp; km@@ outh ; someone who are just visiting the space . &amp; k@@ de ; messages messages are also messages . read it . &quot;
&quot; the remainder are simple text@@ orders . every order that you encounter from the card @-@ card orders , is a text box . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that has written text orders . text entries are intended for the issu@@ er texts that have no special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queue , with the exception of the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; precisely such a pre @-@ reads , this edition is hal@@ ted and ended . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filters will never be applied to the issu@@ ing of screen readers . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; News . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are running as modules . in the future there may be further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify either as words or as a regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will allow the set of chat E@@ mot@@ ot@@ icons such as : - ) by text or for the re@@ format of messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; into a better comprehen@@ sible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former use a X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to convert into another format ; are some X@@ SLT @-@ files for translation by &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML contain .
&quot; with speaker , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ on ; if you have set a female voice at the map spokes@@ man , you can read text by KDE news about it . you can read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has set up adjustable rules , according to which he is applied to a voice output . if the filter does not exist , he gives the text left to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; order ; sent out on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent it by all activated filters , which are arranged on the page below . the processing of filters is processed in the sequence from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of furnished normal filters . is a filter not dispos@@ ed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below are shown below . &quot;
&quot; for the establishment of character chain for@@ ks , you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a compar@@ ative pattern . these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the related replacement text . &quot;
&quot; give a name for your filter a name . for this name , you can choose any number , it must only distinguish from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular phrases . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaced it in accordance with the string . the list will be processed from top to bottom .
click here to postp@@ one the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; using these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file to save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries are attached to the available list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is only applied if the speaker is applied for the text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse @-@ click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the stated applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID run programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must leave you . if for example , q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you can only enter a copy . &quot;
&quot; the character chain filter is applied only then to the text , when all conditions apply with an entry in the box di@@ ciary filter if agree . are all input fields blank , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the drawing tables filter regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be restricted by parti@@ tions ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; Regulation &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular prints can be found in the package . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ transform@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT @-@ files from a format into another format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such revers@@ als . but it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the auxiliary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c accessible via the environmental variable P@@ AT@@ H is also sufficient x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the speaker either , you can send texts to a particular speaker , who is set up on the map spokes@@ man , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can , for example set that texts from k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter indicates , there is a speaker for the text . the spokes@@ man is selected for the text . the speakers is compiled , and the properties that were selected at the map spokes@@ person with the speaker , you can write the selected spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular prints , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you define the properties of the desired filter conditions . if the text displayed the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , the desired requirements are most viewed . click on the button right to display the dialog speaker choice . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
&quot; the intercom controller filter is applied only then to the text , when all conditions apply with an entry in the box di@@ ciary filter if you encounter . you need to enter at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ edition API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD on &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API to be added with the language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ts can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice @-@ output API by &amp; k@@ de ; . complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice services over the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface between &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; to read the text of the text and option to read a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands that you may use . for a list of all commands please specify
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . start the kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the above @-@ mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ forming filter , but with the use of the module for the festival web pages are not read . &quot;
due to an error in the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you must install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ B@@ LE does not work at all . you &apos;ll also have to do that if you do not use this voice to read the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c and about the environmental variable P@@ AT@@ H .
&quot; certain characters or dot@@ ted characters appear to cause mistakes in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences is over@@ thrown or only Cau@@ c@@ ess@@ ly . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option string coding is adjusted to the correct value for the corresponding language . there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a character chain filter . &quot;

&quot; the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a adap@@ table module for language syn@@ thesi@@ zers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesi@@ zers , set up with the developer &apos;s team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used to support SS@@ ML and for the XML ; converting filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of KDE ( Version 3.4 or later ) including the packages for delicate and editing files for the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source text from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text box , you have downloaded or downloaded the tar@@ ball for each night , then install and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts , use first , check if Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . on this , you can use the Shell@@ .@@ pt SPD . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ am ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ on ; it is designed to be further developed by the program Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is supposed to be further developed and the script should no longer needed .
&quot; a long text will be dis@@ assembled in single sets . the user can proceed to or go back , repeat the output or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application dict@@ ates text to &amp; market ; there may be an application for example a female English speakers . if you want to have an application for example , whose language English and his gender is female , this is , otherwise it is automatically chosen the most suitable speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a spokes@@ person select , see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the map spokes@@ man on Add , and then click Edit on the list , the map controller is displayed . as an example , it is shown below the furnishings of the module for the festival Interactive . for details on the modules you can find under . &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H you only need to enter the festival area .
&quot; select the string coding for text , which is delivered to the festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting will be automatically made . generally speaking , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you place volume , intercom speed and pitch from synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regul@@ ators and display this grey , the voice chosen by you choose these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you load this cross field , these voices are already filed with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with a large amount of memory ) the first set is more syn@@ thesi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; if this stimulation can not be selected , you still have no rec@@ iter ( or forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; at the start of week@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window will be displayed . otherwise , after starting only the symbol of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; this starter box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD appears to read a text . this way , you will have the possibility to read or do otherwise . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application , which has hired the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just finished proposition . the speakers ID corresponds to the column ID on the map spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can proceed in the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several movements ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text entries are listed and managed . expenses of screen @-@ re@@ a@@ ders , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . for more information about the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio version . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or layout ; can do not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , click here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to select at least one module . please select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
configure the intercom speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equivalent to approximately half and 200@@ .00 ; % approximately the double regular intercom speed . so that these settings can be implemented so the program must be installed so@@ x .
click to apply to the new settings for running the current &amp; user interface .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select standard . &quot;
&quot; on this map map you can set special action , which will always be executed when the text box is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four kinds of voice orders : &quot;
the output of screen @-@ re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is considered to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the edition of the Screen reader has been read and the added orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next higher priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot reserved . a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning again .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you have a long text on a website , you can greet you with &amp; km@@ outh ; nevertheless someone welcome someone who is just entering the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio issue in queue . &quot;
&quot; the audio file is always played , when a normal text application is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map apply only for normal text messages . for messages , war@@ nings and expenses of screen @-@ reel , there are no special promotions if they will be interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start cri@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card @-@ card notices will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; select this an@@ cross field to turn the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; to turn it off . this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated , and with@@ standing , reads no noti@@ fications before . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , noti@@ fications when a sound is ab@@ used , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , you will be able to select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing else indicated , will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; use this selection field to determine what &amp; kt@@ op@@ ts , do if an event meets . you have the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you choose to read the defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following posts : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired service provider . standard select the speaker , which will be displayed in the list on the map spokes@@ man as the top entry . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . for a specific event of any particular application , this action is executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of certain application is executed . as the last chance comes the action to the stret@@ chers that is under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the Event All noti@@ fications for application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . this allows you to define the noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the button save to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . use the button store to download stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice output , the speaker , the volume , of sex , voice and the pitch . the SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ op@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you have to install the Rab _ di@@ phone Voice ( bri@@ tish male ) since this is the default voice that is used in the edition of SS@@ ML .
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound in the festival configuration is not set to 100@@ den ; % adjusted , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ coding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE / TR / Spe@@ ech @-@ Syn@@ thesis / / EN &quot; &quot; asked Mama Bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the bear kind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; there are two kinds of filters - normal filters and typ@@ ing filters ( SD@@ S filter ) . SB@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences , because only the first sentence has to be syn@@ thesi@@ zed , not the whole text box . this allows you to also move on the card @-@ card orders or prevent and ab@@ rupt , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer this does not directly support . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the stat@@ utes of bor@@ der@@ ment filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a pro@@ filing protocol . you can change its settings , or add further stat@@ utes , early days , but will get down from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn from the microphone choice through ex@@ iting . place the speaker selection , select some properties and check out how to choose the speaker . you need of course have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; then faster with the pre@@ reading can begin , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long . &quot;
&quot; then you can proceed or ab@@ ort text orders on the map , even if the language syn@@ thesizer this function does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal stat@@ eless@@ ness filter is automatically set up when you start the t@@ all@@ sm@@ s for the first time . it can not be switched off , only you don &apos;t change anything at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
stat@@ utes and identifiable filter compare text with a regular expression for typ@@ ing and add a t@@ ame ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the stat@@ utes ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) in front of the fil@@ tering automatically out of the text ) . note that the standard dep@@ loy @-@ recognition filter is included .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( none ) , war@@ nings , messages , or the output of screen @-@ reel . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking out of the normal stat@@ utes , you can insert this again by downloading the default file _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
on cart@@ on map microphone choice you can write the microphone settings for application . the card @-@ card is displayed when
use of the default speaker ( the top on the map spokes@@ man ) . in other words : there are no microphone properties .
&quot; the use of the most suitable speaker , which displays all properties of a decorated speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ op@@ ts ; otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts , the speaker , the most originally introduced properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired service properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not matter , do not give anything . &quot;
&quot; mark this cross @-@ cross field , if the property should prevail over other properties . you can also set multiple mark@@ ings here . &quot;
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always considered to be a priority property . you will probably want to use this property , if you possibly know that a certain application text in a different language is sent in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the area speaker , the most likely to delete , click on the button @-@ button speaker and then use speakers , the most listed below . &quot;
in this case 0 for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is required 0 ) .
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes immediately when it is started . I have de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get back . &quot;
G@@ Stre@@ amer is over@@ thrown and &amp; kt@@ op@@ ts ; probably you have to subscribe to G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved . if the problem is not resolved is possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update G@@ Stre@@ amer or un@@ install .
&quot; the audio edition of AL@@ SA does not work , if I stop using another application , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . at the &amp; kon@@ sole ; appears a message that h@@ unted : free to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; in your system , the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA is possible to prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the web site of the AL@@ SA @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have installed an additional voice for the festival on the Internet . I have installed them and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ .@@ me . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you find the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the map audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and through the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ ze module such as Festival Interactive offer itself on the map for speaker . depending on your chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the intercom speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML . ( this is because that the HTML is controlled in SS@@ ML . ( see ) or , if you are completely mu@@ ddy , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ form filter , and set the info speed up . &quot;
I don &apos;t think that websites can be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokes@@ man but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web site with a male voice .
&quot; at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag seems to work SA@@ B@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not work . thus , the X@@ SL file re@@ jects the converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
I added one own character chain filter and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more sales - or go back . on the top @-@ top orders you see , the order was done only out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; sign of pun@@ ctu@@ ation ( point , question mark , comm@@ a , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter . use for this sign instead a filter to the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )

&quot; some users experience in conjunction with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio issue . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and read a text . you can also start a text box and then start a further . possible solutions for this problem you can find on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with the status of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you have a text entry into our position ; the current set will still be read yet . &quot;

&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that will be delivered with the festival , you need to read Web pages , you need to install the ( Male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you must compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on transfer . &quot;

&quot; the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux , distri@@ butions you are looking for the first time on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be adjusted to a 8 @-@ bit co@@ gri@@ lled such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the Festival can be installed together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer , the l@@ ex@@ ical analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; creates the audio version . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; votes can be downloaded from &quot;
please note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; does not make a complete voice system . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generates language of di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to generate these Di@@ phone . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create from German texts di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this case , additional W@@ rap@@ per code is added to the festival to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; votes for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voice files are not in the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ folder are not installed in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , a module for the &amp; _ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows the management of network interfaces , routine and DNA settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks : &quot;
after installation a new module settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu .
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , network hardware cannot install and configure . physical devices and their drivers need to be functioning properly and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and setting the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed at the installation of &amp; Linux ; they are installed and installed . network devices later added , the drivers need to be loaded via modification of the following files , according to the core version : &quot;
&quot; the module controls will be loaded when the option is selected for network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index selected . when starting the module settings , this , the platform used in the system will be automatically recognized . &quot;
&quot; if the platform may not be recognized , the best selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release can be best meets . by selecting the adjustment not @-@ again issues the setting is set to be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically set . &quot;
&quot; the modification of the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all the options are shown gray , changing settings can be viewed only . in the system administration mode , you will be able to enter the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is the entry of the password required . &quot;
in the system administration mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
&quot; the tab interface interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
setup settings can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and listing of the button ... in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced settings shows the dialog with further opportunities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Autom@@ atic settings , the TCP / IP settings are made from a DH@@ CP @-@ Server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information is required for the system at the same time . in the selection list , the TCP / IP information is required . in the selection list may be either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , selected . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of manual , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP specified the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , initi@@ alizes the system &apos;s interface in the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values given in this dialog will be displayed as properties of the device in the device .
it should be assured that IP address is not already used in the network . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices may be activated or switched on , depending on the need . switching of a activated network device is activated by selecting from the list and listing of interface .... &quot;
network devices may be activated or activated according to the need . switching of a activated network device is made by selecting the list and click on the interface ....
&quot; sets the IP address of the machine in the local sub@@ net , which conv@@ eys the physical connection to remote networks , and is by default to use the TCP / IP communication with b@@ anners in other sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is present more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located . &quot;
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain hub through the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers will only be able to understand IP addresses . if the computer is called http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org . if the computer uses this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine to nam@@ ing up part of the equ@@ estrian nam@@ esp@@ solution enables a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . DNS entries can be arranged through the selection of entries and execution or pos@@ rating in the list with the buttons or herd in the priority . &quot;
by clicking the button to add ... from the group calcul@@ ator a DNS server can be added . it will be shown the dialog New Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
&quot; first , you must enter the IP @-@ address of the DNS server and then insert the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; . &quot; the entry is inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator , select an entry and then click on the button to edit .... It will be shown the dialog editing . &quot;
the list of particular calcul@@ ator describes computer name @-@ to @-@ IP address version for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by boats if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list is specifically known calcul@@ ator some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . these are still in the test @-@ based version of IP is supposed to replace version 4 in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP @-@ address of the known b@@ anners and click Add .... To add the dialog New alias .
&quot; insert the name of the known b@@ anners and click the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; button . if the known computer has several ali@@ ases , de Kno@@ pf # add several times and enter the other ali@@ ases name . &quot;
select an entry of a specially known b@@ anners from the list and select Edit .... The dialogue of acquain@@ t@@ ances is shown .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
the settings made in the module settings are not immediately implemented in the system . to activate the changes in a &amp; console ; the following command must be cancelled .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually r@@ pm packages ) it ranges when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and install in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition the development package with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology will be given in the second all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; modify configuration files . &quot;
&quot; this section can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network are convey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) is managed by TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) , IP@@ v@@ 5 has never expected great distribution . this description is therefore concentrated in the near IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is to assign which IP address of a network interface is to assign . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator the contact person , which is a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can not be chosen as any as you choose . &quot;
&quot; when entering a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area for this purpose to avoid IP address . the addresses from the table below are not passed on the Internet , so it is possible to use any use . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be facilit@@ ated by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks usually addresses in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
some addresses are reserved for special things 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route that will be the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP forwar@@ ding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of one &apos;s so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
&quot; in this section , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed at DSL connections , so it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content as defined there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand is expected as expected . &quot;

&quot; the second goal was to store several archives on a tape . the second goal was to establish several archives on a tape . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take , if you ass@@ ures it ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be incorporated into three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; soldier , the band back and reads the door information of the belt . recognize &amp; kis@@ sing ; the for@@ ay on the band not , you are asked if the band is to be form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; kis@@ sing ; the flag@@ ship , it looks for the matching index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band index will be created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , change the symbol for the belt cycle , to indicate that the band is involved . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the volume can now be sear@@ ched through out of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; in front of throwing the ban@@ des , first of all , the inclusion must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; there is a change of the symbol for the band through a change of the symbol for the band , that the inclusion of the band has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the band can now be ej@@ ected without risk . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; con@@ dat , can be used , it must be dated by &amp; con@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; a band @-@ types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use for stor@@ ing data . this procedure does not correspond to the form@@ atting when you need to be form@@ at@@ ted before using the tape . Flo@@ ppy belt works usually function a form@@ atting of the ban@@ ker , DAT DAT drives , on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat , with the form@@ atting of the belt . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting , the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the following files . this can be done on three ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in the local file tree , only this file or folder is saved . &quot;
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files mentioned in the profile are secured .
&quot; highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folder are secured . &quot;
right click on the local file tree and choose the menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialogue opens up settings for secure . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue appears to be secure . the dialogue shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive , only the selected file or folder is checked . &quot;
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a box . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and choose the menu item .
&quot; once the test process has been started , the dialogue will be opened for verification . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog will review . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data set and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can establish the re @-@ establish , the files that should be restored , which can be restored , this can take place in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the band@@ age . it is restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder .
&quot; select the desired files from one of the archives , with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folder are restored . &quot;
&quot; right click on a file or folder in one of the archives , and choose the menu &quot;
&quot; once the re @-@ setup process has been started , the dialogue will appear to restore . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog will be re@@ produced . this dialog shows the progress of the re @-@ performance as well as the data set and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band @-@ index@@ file on the basis of the band &apos;s contents . this procedure delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this will create a backup profile with the just marked files and the default settings . you can make a backup profile the following settings :
&quot; the current working folder , in which the backup should be done . the list of in@@ sured files is automatically updated according to the selected work folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folder , listed under backup files , applies that only those files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folder , which are stored on other file systems , you can separate separately under backup files . each entry is seen from tar regardless of the other files . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is stored , only the files saved since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
&quot; delet@@ es the snap@@ shots from the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and created a new snap@@ shot for the next backup . &quot;
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not yet implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings allows you to configure the menu item KD@@ at ... in the Settings Settings . the following settings can make you :
the full path to the device driver for the belt cycle ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ve variant of the belt device .
&quot; if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; con@@ dat : before the band is involved the command can load load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary to be done before reading or writing processes . &quot;
&quot; is the option switched on , tried &amp; k@@ ary ; the ej@@ ection of the belt cycle . possibly this setting does not work with all stages of belt . &quot;
&quot; is the option switched on , when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dated ; automatically the band has been ej@@ ected . use this option not with flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; is the option switched on , tried &amp; k@@ au@@ ction ; the hard@@ war@@ ts put variable size for the belt cycle . no matter if this setting is active or not , you have to resolve the block size for your band@@ age . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ dat : a tape is form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should only be stored a block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( N by@@ te ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is machine name : seconds , with b@@ name of the full name of the system in which the tape was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds since the time has been form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log , is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer &apos;s viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system allows for quick access to information about problems related to their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log , is a simplified version of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , which can not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system uses the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log , experienced users allows quick access to information about problems related to their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions with whose help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 possesses &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful features include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screenshot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log features ; functions available , with their help to filter the single protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file easily fil@@ tering and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting , &amp; k@@ system@@ log , first tries to open the system &apos;s protocol . it will not be displayed with system administration right . the protocol files are usually not listed in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar , so that just log lines will be displayed . in the default setting , the selection range is displayed next to the filter All . then a protocol @-@ line will only be shown when in one of the columns the string matches will contain . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . select the string label protocol , then select only with the entries in accordance with selected columns . select for example in the filter column the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines on which are sent from this process respectively . &quot;
this option is activated in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a show@@ y colour as a protocol lines of level notice . the colored presentation of protocol @-@ lines can be switched off .
&quot; for example , you want to display a certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can , for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you can use fil@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new and upcoming protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log , allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage . once you have chosen a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ org. You can find further information about the sources listed by &amp; k@@ system@@ log .
&amp; Qu@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in the &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it Editor , known as well known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program running at the top of the system in the &amp; Linux ; and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it . &quot;
&quot; I will not go here further on historical aspects ( among other things , because I know nothing about it : - ) . &quot;
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is why anyone could try to create a machine on System V In@@ it , without a rein@@ stall and re @-@ format . therefore , you &apos;ll need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from BSD In@@ it , that is the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following more folder : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start using the system or when change to another run@@ level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services include not such things as set@@ serial , which only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be in turn to the other under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems also own this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something with the rep@@ utable connection . &quot;
the kernel is searching for different places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first one .
the default Run@@ level is available in / etc / in@@ itt@@ any . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can throw a look at the second column and probably find that the pre @-@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you &apos;ll be very careful when you start doing something , then you &apos;ll be repaired by changing the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scrip@@ ting ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you will probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that in this folder you are no real files . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the script is written so that it is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start using this script on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K includes the script with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server -@@ Run@@ level , that &apos;s just htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run . in addition , I could also have a user @-@ Run@@ level , that &apos;s &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other po@@ inters is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of the Avail@@ able system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts also between Run@@ lev@@ les or change the position within a level by changing it elsewhere . this will only happen if they draw an entry from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) .
&quot; note : entries are shifted , if you select them into a new zone . to select it solely on a new run @-@ level , you must explicitly select copying from the menu or from the context menu and even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you have to edit the fl@@ ex@@ ation of the surrounding items before you can try again to insert system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no way to restore entry into the tr@@ ash . be so careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the c@@ ursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another Run@@ time , move it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of an entry manually , press the entry button to change the Properties dialog . use the tab@@ ulator button to change between different fields and enter the dialog by selecting the changes , or press Es@@ c to cast the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they will be executed . &quot;
all settings will be stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be deleted from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they are saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; amendments to the pres@@ ets will be stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I &apos;ve been experimenting with the standard @-@ Run@@ lev@@ les , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; at the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single , and press the entry button to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default Run@@ level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) . &quot;
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way of how system services are started in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v , are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use any other distribution : please check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply stop without notice , if their configuration files are not available or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save it . either use the relevant icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry save in the menu file . &quot;
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two boxes cards to the user interface and the user group . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialogue user interface or group characteristics .
some card cards are only shown if you have extended system settings . only if you have extended system settings on which you can make individual settings on which you can make individual settings . further boxes cards appear if Shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ ces .
the map controller appears if Shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ ces .
this card card appears to be activated only in case for at least one in the file quot@@ as ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable on the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user while the space restrictions are available in KB :
these parameters can be set for each fil@@ es@@ ystem individually . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system .
card @-@ card groups inform@@ s about the group members of the selected user . the standard group that belongs to the user can be found in the field Prim@@ ary group . furthermore the user can be a member in other groups by using them in the big field .
&quot; the dialog features the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click on the appropriate Add @-@ button of the tool@@ bar . the editing or del@@ e@@ tion of the selected user or selected group will be analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove systems , modify , change and more . &quot;
