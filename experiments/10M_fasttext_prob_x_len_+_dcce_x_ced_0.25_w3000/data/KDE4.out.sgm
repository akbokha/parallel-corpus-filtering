<seg id="408">"another important tool is to be found in the menu under colors key factor. this tool provides an integrated way to store multiple colors channels, so you can also use your settings to use them. this is helpful when your camera or your scanner always need the same mistake and you can always find the same correction. in the manual on the sound correction, you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="409">"to correct a very powerful possibility of loading problems, the tool for gradation is that you can find under colors gradation in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digitization came; tool color effects puts you four color effects, a solar panel, a Velvia filter, a neon-effect and a canteen filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing was solar, also Sabatier called, an effect that was created when one developed a partially developed pressure from a short lightspeed. it had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted through the second light. the result was a disofter negatively of the image. this tool allows you to see this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at about 50% intensity the image shows what chemically is possible. another increase creates a negative image that is not to be created on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system. the original image is the (1) and it works (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simuates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrasting effect of the colors brilliant and smooth. try it simple, he embellished many photos. "</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name optimized for one on daylight. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for his smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated color, but also some photographs, especially those of the most beautiful landscapes."</seg>
<seg id="416">"the Neonfilter is simulated Neonlight on the contrast. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlight. with great pictures, the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual you want to correct the color contrasting and the luminosity of the photo. you can watch experimenting with the various coloured codes of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are happy with the result you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse issue: one to great saturation. even in this case the tool for brightness will reduce the saturation instead of raising it. all changes that you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool Gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / Gamma is the tool soundproofing to improve the exposure. even if the dialog on this tool appears very complicated, you need only the area of the slider. more substantiate the three slider below the histograms."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window includes a graph of intensity, a histogram, of active channel or selected area. under the graphs are three slider to change in, and which can be moved to change the intensity of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>

<seg id="479">& checking came; provides three different tools to furnace. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for furnaces. it is very fast and simple, but produced especially in dark areas, grained images."</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpenmask is working on the contrast of the edges to make an image sharper. in fact it is not a bit like it works rather psychovisuell. you can use it to take a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and he is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"revocation is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters to adjust."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitalization process need to be put together with minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras do normally require more consistent sharpening as normal cameras for private use."</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG pictures, there is often a camera to have been applied. pictures in the raw format, on the other hand, always must be sharpened during the processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner apply a sharpness already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this deactivate, you get the control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by setting up a photo with the furnace menu. you can call it with the menu entry for correcting shots."</seg>
<seg id="487">"they should hereby be careful, as the results will not be very natural: the furnaces increased the sharpness of the edges. in general, the consumer's barbust technique is increasing. you can get further information about the menu entry into correcting revocation. below revocation you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to furnaces."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: one image is too cracky. the solution to draw the picture a little soft. use the tool for softness with the menu entry corrigid softening and experiment something with settings. the curtains on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is blurred. a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview can help editing the image. it shows the current edition of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should first try out the effect. if you create insharpening mask, smoke and the impression of atrocities in the vicinity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is like many pixels on each side of a canal which are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radiators. therefore they should be able to raise images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wired image one which is added to the original. thus the strength of the harness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swamp is a rupture from the maximum RGB value and the difference difference. one can thereby define a minimum difference between the killing of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpenes except and hence beauty error in faces, Heavenly and water-surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred masquerade filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sponge = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">"the & digitization came; tool revocation, focused on a picture by improving the harp. it used the copyrighted dehydration filter -algorithm from Ernst Lippe."</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries an image to & quot; refocussing. this is better approach than just trying to shark the photo. it's a better approach than just trying to mask the photo. it is using a technique named FIR Wiener Filtering. it is using a technique named FIR Wiener Filtering. you can start using a technique named FIR Wiener Filtering. you can start it from the menu by getting color Refuscs in the editing process.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular lowers works much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which depends far from the original pixel, which is widely influenced by the original pixel. the FIR Wiener inverse of the Gauß'schen Faltung is influenced even very strongly from the remote pixel. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the main parameter for the use of this module. for most images the default value should arise. you can put a higher value when your image is very blurred, but then on Heiligenstraps. "</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected by 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and on. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"Rauschfilter: an increase in the smokfilter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0,1 is rarely helpful. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the smoke-filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. an appropriate value is 0.03. a high value will continue the image even further."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche Schärfe: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche Schärfe. in most cases, you should use this value on 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you may also have to increase the correlation and / oderhfilters."</seg>
<seg id="503">MatrizenSize: this value determines the size of the Transformationsmatrix. however please note that the module is very slow when you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving and loading buttons are exactly used for that purpose. any reclustic parameters you have set is set for later and can be loaded for later.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cuts, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image before you change the picture. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible but later left untreated artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">"to read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurred mask produce better results as scarfs. this could be caused by doing the blurred masquerade a larger neighborhood as sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically. even under optimal conditions it has to produce radicalming increasingly artifacts. even under optimal conditions it is never possible to indicate the effect of the FIR filter. practical, the result of the FIR Vienna Filters is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>

<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to edit the filter settings of fine juscs, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailing p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a little value leads to an even more homogeneous more than the image. a value of 0.01 should keep details so necessary. please note that the detailing is always subordinated."</seg>
<seg id="520">"straightness Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you create a film-like pattern. JPEG artifacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothed [0, 500]: this sets the maximum gliding factor above allabnormp then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of smoking in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher the value is set, the more it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh'Turbulenzy effect it must be higher than 3."</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius is controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can limit the image into it and the color in it is checked and thus cleared up smaller errors."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the pixelabstness. this value puts the pixelabyss which faces the filter to the front. if it is lifted up, the adapters filters can change the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details do not receive more and smoker or lubricate again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the cantonal accuracy of the filter. if it is too strong, the frequency response from the filter. if it is too strong, the entire smokets can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a little noise, or JPEG-artefacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend you either to change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the details controlled by the details.</seg>

<seg id="1519">A brief list with parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most musical pieces of acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo and high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo and high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs more and 256 kbps for complex and fewer complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a titels. good recovery for music by young people, portable devices and autoimmune systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that are manually entered by the program automatically from the freeDB program, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & geraudiocreator; and the codiererprogram to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with codierprograms, there is often a combination of programs for the codifier and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the codification explain the switches on these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, adding the & CD; title to the sampling (English: day), when MP3s are coded with lame, the switches must be added by lame and the title parameters of & audio-audio creator; the result looks as follows: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in the assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"that's what the freeDB is: a free database, in which individuals can download the audio CD, so that all others can download this information instead of being written into the calculator: & CD; title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not of the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the Ueberger) I am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information or less worthless, so it can be obtained neither the artist nor the music business damage. all information can be obtained from a bumblebee by a & CD; business, physical or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & audiocreator; is active to choose a cross field (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This may only know the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are in many countries copies of the main database. if & auaudiocreator; used to use the freeDB, the geographically uses the closest mirrored server. this saves bandwidth in the network and resembles the load between machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org offers a current list of mirrors for the online retrieval of & CD; information on the read of a & CD; alternatively you can download the complete database or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumors that used to be cdparanoia; who wants to know more precisely in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to be noted that the cdparanoia package should be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"for saving the WAV files, the Kodierer can be elected and thus the desired file format. at first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a verlustfree compression for audio data) on the tab. other coders can be added to this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the Kodierer package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution, before the code can be used, and this is also necessary for the pre-defined co-file. for more information about Codierer can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer."</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a codile you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consoles window (eg; Console). there must be 'lame' to be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the establishment of the device recording of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, FLAC & etc;) installed. try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give a reference to what is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copied audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, everything understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, there is no problem, follow this step-for-step example, and you will get enough information to be able to set the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">"in this example, we will start the program for the first time, all set up and read our first & CD. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to produce MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sampling (tags)."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"there must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your machine. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution, as it is considered not completely free software as it is not necessary to compile source files, which you can always do."</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have screaming on it (eg; by trying to copy something into the conqueror something).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic instalment of & audiocreator; something which will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">"the second section describes how to read a & CD, what needs to be repeated for each readable & CD."</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the compression codeners for the compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy to use the program to use the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change one & CD at any time, once the appropriate settings are found."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is delivered to the readable program that it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">"frequently, / dev / CDROM is a symbolic link to the real device recording of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive, the effective device can also be accessed through the file / etc / fstab and an attempt using existing entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives."</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card-card General settings. here is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be created / inspired as in the screenshot.</seg>

<seg id="1557">"the second drop-down list is easier, a & CD entry is found, starts immediately reading the & CD; it's with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the filename directory / filename &gt; rename, and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"apart from this example, further notice: if you wish to manually enter everything manually, so activate the selection fields and freeDB will not be used. however, this over 620 MB large, you'll need to use the database before. however, the two choices must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set on the following card map."</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us to freeDB. these are settings for the data request for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server via the Internet. how does the system get the CD to get? read the section about the freeDB. put it on how it is pictured in the screenshot.</seg>

<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to page freedb.org and look after a mirror server in your vicinity. on this road the load is distributed between the machines. however this setting will work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">"both are equivalent to the server, as many firewalls use the protocol 8880 by default, there is perhaps more happiness with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet."</seg>

<seg id="1568">"all to enter as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under conditions something must be turned to the right to see everything."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. this achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption."</seg>

<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard is shown. the general usage looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equitable sign is ignored. it is believed that the GM patches in the right sequence are available (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional All keysTo M is needed to put all notes, which need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard, for example do not take a gun (e.g. with sound 60), which may take the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (Win), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term" "Drum patch" "patch is meant to be a different percussioning instrument (drum, basin, Maracas & etc;), and not the one who means the tone that is always the same drum (as some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">KEYMAP section is needed to give as notes on a specified channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as its availability. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to make notes on the pertinent channel. take a look at the details supplied by Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to switch some channels to others. if you want to swap for example the first and second channel, make it easily at CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-Devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section so has 16 lines, numbered between 0 and 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"N is the channel, which is formed on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap does not need to be defined in the file name for this channel. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events are ignored that will change the patch on this channel. in this case it will always be patch x used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option Forcepatch can be useful for example to always use the pertinent patch on the perkussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBench Ratio will be multiplied with the value of the Pitch Bender events. if a MIDI file is converted with the value, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is calculated and then transmitted only. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file is not decimal-mas."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed, because GM is said that a keyboard, which is to play a pitch using the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards by two notes up to an octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole bunch of pivions (one for any MIDI channel). on these pivions you see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view also to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can choose a tool, the button is no longer green but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. if you can, for example, a song is too quick to follow the text you can slow down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that has to be played on how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc.. thus, the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything but watch out & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resources-endatrots will be replaced.</seg>

<seg id="2067">"a simple list of separated-separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;)."</seg>

<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and workpieces. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be everything from & CSS; -patterns to work specifications specifically for the files of a specific project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder-tree of the project, resulting in common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project."</seg>

<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be in turn to the other under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems also own this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to do something with the reputable connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places according to the program init and starts the first one.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is available in / etc / inittany. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can throw a look at the second column and probably find that the pre-set Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you'll be very careful when you start doing something, then you'll be repaired by changing the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripting? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, you will probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you are no real files. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the script is written so that it is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start using this script on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K includes the script with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server -Runlevel, that's just httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; run. in addition, I could also have a user-Runlevel, that's & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was as user-friendly as possible."</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointers is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of the Available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts also between Runlevles or change the position within a level by changing it elsewhere. this will only happen if they draw an entry from its original Runlevel (or its position).</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are shifted, if you select them into a new zone. to select it solely on a new run-level, you must explicitly select copying from the menu or from the context menu and even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you have to edit the flexation of the surrounding items before you can try again to insert system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no way to restore entry into the trash. be so careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to enable the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another Runtime, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the entry button to change the Properties dialog. use the tabulator button to change between different fields and enter the dialog by selecting the changes, or press Esc to cast the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they will be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings will be stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets will be deleted from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they are saved by & ksysv; amendments to the presets will be stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I've been experimenting with the standard-Runlevles, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"at the LILO -Prompt linux single, and press the entry button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel at a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they will not be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way of how system services are started in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv, are planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use any other distribution: please check if all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply stop without notice, if their configuration files are not available or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel, so that this manual can be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
