&quot; although I had visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extraordinary .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , I have been playing American music , American authors and operated his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me , that I mainly became a journalist for American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gr@@ ay Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , which covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspir@@ acy of a oil @-@ magn@@ ates who had his interest s@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only been reinforced . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety are so inviting you &apos;re always who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very dirty letter of love about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
a lot was written about xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me , as it goes with its bott@@ len@@ ders . &quot;
he never stops his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague expressed it , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him in Sch@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won by the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number that has ever reached a candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support these big@@ gie person , asked me ? &quot;
I could not bring Tru@@ mp and his voters into harmony with the people that I met in Phoenix during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the Journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deep breath person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; also the Tru@@ mp@@ s world@@ view not with the author of Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met us in our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix &quot; in the game . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Int@@ oler@@ ance stands also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived with Sandy B@@ ahr , who fight for their lives for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as her son . &quot;
&quot; it is still adapting to the commitment of Krist@@ i Capp@@ es , which always helped me to get used with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise couns@@ el helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and those caused by them em@@ bo@@ died my love of America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp goes its way to the appointed Republi@@ can presidential data , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part of his restricted vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the argument with the idea that people have voted for Tru@@ mp because they have either shared its racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , and broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp elec@@ torate as a r@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange people , one of my friends , is exactly what has led to us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and respectful and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in another way .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of which most of them are , for Tru@@ mp , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented the cruel decision to desc@@ end a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t upon those who look differently from it . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( m. ) . : much as &quot; &quot; el@@ ong@@ ation of the White against all other Eth@@ ni@@ cs &quot; ; &quot; wor@@ ding from white in an@@ thro@@ ws on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as Schl@@ eu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the great Van Jones , who has done exactly what America did so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you like , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ man whose history , as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but with the election Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s there is a huge part of the white America of this promise , saying : &quot; &quot; hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; bel@@ lows the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answered them . &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; could someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and lu@@ cr@@ ack &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; God is thanks to Mr. Tru@@ mp , that is not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s country , said the message . &quot;
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school in the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
&quot; the music , which is played on both places , not just the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica has now been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults of existing Symphony Orchestra , which has found a way to overcome them surrounding them . &quot;
a Musik@@ schule with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drugs abuse and the gangs violence . &quot;
but this changed after an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth so a rare hop@@ eless hope .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously and the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi :
&quot; once they come from school , they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to follow her big passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come and play with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the bu@@ stling you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , B@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Gar@@ bage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village which is practically at the biggest tr@@ ash of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments , which are made of recur@@ ring waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re @-@ prepared instruments that consist of local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for music instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a where the Rec@@ ycl@@ er under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste in instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ i@@ ded viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , guit@@ ars , fl@@ utes , trump@@ ets , trumpet , tromb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion , which were all produced from the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ish and Latin American music as well as music of The Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez is remin@@ is@@ cent of the local econom@@ ologist and Musi@@ cians &apos; children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , to the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach in the same place the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something has been shown what he had never seen before : a made of waste @-@ made violin .
&quot; today , there are a whole orchestra which plays on instruments of re@@ prepared material and that is called The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical performance to :
the world is produced every year about one billion tonnes of tr@@ ash .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poorest , like men in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here she will transform it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational spectacle from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has played its music in front of Pope Francis :
&quot; these eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork has successfully overcome illegal fishing industry . &quot;
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wil@@ de illegal fishing fought .
&quot; this article , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international , practical solutions to environmental problems . &quot;
the republi@@ cation will happen as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , then it was known that this ship had already engaged in liber@@ i@@ anian waters of illegal fishing fishing , before it looked the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East @-@ African countries were raised with this and little sad@@ dened to welcome the legislative bre@@ wer of this kind on their shores .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised quickly against the ship . they ling@@ ered him , one of their ports , and refuse to share it for a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly was the Premier surrounded by countries that you simply ling@@ ered &quot; , &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading engineer of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authorities . he is part of a team that was discovered and followed the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch him out there fish . &quot;
&quot; ultimately it was comp@@ elled to pay 2 million US dollars to liber@@ ia , because of lo@@ oting the fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which controls criminal practices and resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing ( Ill@@ egal fishing stop ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries which at that time had exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . you exchange information and stand out of each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing . this project offers f@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is by definition un@@ regulated : what is tr@@ apped , is hidden , because of it is extremely difficult to absor@@ b . thus , the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions . &quot;
&quot; by inten@@ tional abuse of existing laws , by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing and ecos@@ ystems will hurt those of a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; however , while actions against illegal fishing were once driven by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ dles and also through the sn@@ ail emp@@ i@@ ou@@ o , with the information between individual countries , so the actions are in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can communicate with each other for example lists existing licenses , news on suspic@@ i@@ ent activities or details that have noticed or experienced during a port . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , when they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships which fish in the bot@@ le areas . also let themselves be suspic@@ i@@ able driving around , such that a ship invites his caught fish on other ships while on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such surveys may show whether the ships involved have a fishing licence , where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal register . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what means that the ships will not sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to numbers of pen@@ alties , such as in the case of the Premier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then a significant financial loss for the owner , which means that the illegal fishing cat@@ ers is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the platform mentioned above was created to gain a estimated 20 million USD an abandoned turnover , losing its eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i each year because of illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate into ost@@ African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una @-@ fish accessories because of the region of commercial fishing from around the world . among these even those illegal fishermen .
&quot; to their practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake lic@@ lic@@ ers , indication of ph@@ antasi@@ zing , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically use the lack of international cooperation and make sure that weaknesses of a non @-@ seam@@ lessly organised control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could not stop illeg@@ ally and a country could not say &quot; You do not dar@@ ing my harbour . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this leg@@ ale Schl@@ up@@ ch tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
&quot; it has exposed criminal networks , the f@@ ake licenses were distributed in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has been abandoned and found . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ POL , the International Authority on combating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i information on illegal fishing can divide and preserved across large distances . &quot;
&quot; some of our studies take us quite far into the networks organised crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system , which should help the ISH @-@ i , suspected ships of precise . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite staff , which is always being developed , also helps to escal@@ ate illegal ships who like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an NGO focusing also with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships also turn off their automatic identification systems , which means that they cannot afford more of satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps build a system linking different information levels together . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence African nations undoubtedly at the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ e@@ ana has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch - a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed on the worldwide position of every single trac@@ eable ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together , together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - that results simply meaning , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to combine themselves and to bund@@ le their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , in which a global system impl@@ ements the persecution of ships . &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als but they also det@@ a@@ illed .
&quot; ships used earlier without licence , and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , they know that they will be observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating at F@@ ISH @-@ i countries participating in the meantime a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats can buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 applied , the insp@@ ections found there on board sl@@ ew , whose use is forbidden . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries to us , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together with so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also they are fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as the ISH . &quot; &quot; With safety , the aim of creating more such initiatives and structures can also be created in other regions . &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia could report his first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag on the road . and not only was the ship used without a license and have been used tow , which are now banned . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated yet in the ban waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the Take @-@ measure against Gre@@ ko 1 set the a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; at ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative working method works to protect the oceans actually throughout the world . Emma Bry@@ ce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . here she writes on environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear at the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela has continued to be seen further : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of reg@@ ain the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fier@@ ce demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum for ministers of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government had rejected the amendment of the opposition to a referendum in ministers , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans had rejected the talks on the political and economic crisis of the country , while they were gathered together on the streets . &quot;
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( approximately : the Return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - including the Bar@@ inas region , in the An@@ den@@ cia Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north @-@ north of Par@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continually , which makes itself noticeable in everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicine . &quot;
many representatives of the opposition saw in the amalg@@ amation of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; but finally the post@@ ure of a re@@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting of Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arized in their latest articles the context of the government . &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and certain@@ ties have been estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate ) and in which a serious and vast lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered to seize the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that tell about disputes , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
particularly large waves hit the message about pol@@ ishing oppression in the central north @-@ north @-@ nearby town of Marac@@ ay .
&quot; there the demonstr@@ ators returned into the local cathedral , to protect itself according to the police and the armed supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators were trying to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des @-@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira carry no redness , because otherwise you could see something what many nation@@ als do not have ! &quot;
meanwhile an Info@@ graphic is already making the scale of repression per day :
so the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a ministers &apos; proceedings - this was now proved in the eyes of many thanks to the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :

&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has done little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and would rather have dealt with , critical voices hidden . &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches always take more in frequency and intensity .

&quot; this is an adapted version of a interviews from Al@@ ejo Gó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ in@@ ean news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father , the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ in@@ ean city Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the frame of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of Córdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the Bür@@ de , the same names as his father contribute to the brutal anth@@ ell@@ ations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
in 34 years he insi@@ sted the family image for himself .
in the situation back then I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , you do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was g@@ end@@ arm@@ er@@ ebe@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 until 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 dep@@ uty com@@ mander of the secret sector 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archi@@ val .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who was charged for kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power has a parent about his child , and how this child chose for himself a way of rede@@ mption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . I had friends with a boy , the martial arts . &quot;
all named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him , and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo , and called me to identify my friend . &quot;
he said :
&quot; you are a Ar@@ sch@@ lo@@ ch , you are rounded with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; pass only on that they will not lead you one day , and I must save you . &quot;
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cle@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - revolution@@ aries - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Labour Party in Argentina . &quot;
&quot; therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would be hearing . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so , my father had pulled me . &quot;
on the military base I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ ag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da dr@@ ones are tor@@ tured the prisoners
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
&quot; on the first and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he command@@ ed to me out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - were . &quot;
everything that was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small into a blank@@ et wrapped , and command@@ ed me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen objects were put up and inter@@ kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
in practice the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I sp@@ ying , and saw a goat , were tor@@ tured on man . &quot;
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they attach it to an end to a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
&quot; it is rarely a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ shot him with water and h@@ unted him a charge of 220 Volt into gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was dra@@ in ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body in need is .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : what is it possible for man to do so much suffering ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with a hand@@ cu@@ bo@@ iler , and hal@@ ted them . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mat@@ tresses on which naked people with the face down@@ ward - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
close to the entrance k@@ au@@ ded people still on the mat@@ tresses .
&quot; when my Father had spot@@ ted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What would you say , Ar@@ sch@@ lo@@ ch ? &quot;
&quot; I dis@@ ed &quot; Why hast thou hast brought me anything else ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and was killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms that were referred to as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there a man sm@@ ashed and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survi@@ vor@@ s of the civil war , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ to , the director of the memorial to La Per@@ la , through the former Fol@@ der chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way , on which you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apped there came here . &quot;
&quot; when you look on the map , see that they took about this route and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names have been changed and they were assigned as part of the process of de@@ du@@ alism a number . &quot;
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement came from above that they should be displ@@ aced . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things to go home .
&quot; at that time in the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as they knew it was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later at the military , I was in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war broke a B@@ aj@@ on@@ ett , or perhaps military signs that one has fought an enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the plate , clothes , paintings , paintings , money ... silent , then this is not a war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , with this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never fell to penet@@ rate into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a crime and I rep@@ lied , and thou that you get cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in front of W@@ ut , I struck me and crying : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and converted yourself . &quot;
this is why we no one need any other !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time , on which I contributed a jack@@ et and a roller swe@@ ater of w@@ ool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence , a fellow betra@@ yed at this crime . I en@@ du@@ ed no problem , they can put me to the burden what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to testi@@ fy .
&apos; the dis@@ appearances of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ ous act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one has only children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
you develop further and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I was even so far to say :
&quot; good , you have ex@@ pi@@ red during the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apping ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have just been able to put them into prison .
&quot; I appreciate it was simply decided to kill these people , but why don &apos;t disappear their cor@@ p@@ ses ? &quot;
did these people not even have families to whom to pass their mor@@ tal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ ous act that you can do to a person .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they took care to remove the mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were destroyed and somewhere ent@@ ates - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my dad .
&quot; the thought , display my father was created during a talk , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him accus@@ ations because of all of the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; I do not know . I have killed nobody . &quot;
&quot; I felt silent and asked me , why the whole of patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they were alleg@@ edly defended , actually good . &quot;
then I cri@@ ed :
how can you tell me what to say ?
I saw how you killed people !
you have committed horrible crimes and you have forced me to participate as a child .
he only disgu@@ ise &quot; Na then forgive me . &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
2010 @-@ refundable I was the first ad .
I have finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame me that I am bi@@ ased . I finally said against my own father .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error to a center in Kyoto , where you can extend its leadership . &quot;
the photo was circul@@ ated in social media .
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers became a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long its leadership , last month witnesses of a very un@@ miss@@ able translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word was posted , with the older mot@@ orists , the &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; means to fal@@ si@@ eve - maybe even with vi@@ cious but@@ chers &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful auto@@ bi@@ kers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was from 1st to 20th of September to electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ otos . he was also aware of the local time @-@ time . &quot;
the Kyoto Newspaper of Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; awe @-@ drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , if gram@@ mati@@ cally not entirely correct term &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( English : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) was replaced . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto ap@@ olog@@ ised for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the bug was already contained in the text they had received from transl@@ ators and that the translation has not been tested thoroughly before they have been published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we sincerely felt that older people felt by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) in our part , &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat down a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; awesome &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; &quot; was ref@@ using as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police there are the percentage of older drivers who are engaged in accidents , but absolutely cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto for instance , was created in 2005 1,9@@ 41 from a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of seniors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , seniors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 by a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , its share rose to 17,@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has declined in total , the proportion of seniors caused by senior accidents in the same period . &quot;
&quot; specifically , the Repor@@ ter brought in the release of the article comments to light , which show which prejudi@@ ces are seemingly apparently against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo on the translation errors , among other things received the following comments : &quot;
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; ) about not the reality ?
&quot; - &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty is the translation actually not , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I do not find that this is a real translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gra@@ ish &quot; is so common in all of Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and quite Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true discovery for this bizarre error in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
&quot; for charging , you need two important features : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active voice @-@ knowledge to transfer him into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter , the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in case with mother@@ language . in general , the conviction that transl@@ ators in the target language - not in the cur@@ riculum - native language should be . &quot;
&quot; thus , a French native language should translate into French for example by the English language - not from the French in English . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ Users Karl Bar@@ on .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a native language , the translations into English . this may be mis@@ understanding of the excess , quot@@ ations or the relatively small number of English speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies who do not have any foreign employees , do not release translations nevertheless on @-@ internal . then the Japanese employees , whose German knowledge is estimated to be the best in transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ Users Karl Bar@@ on .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ted and pu@@ zz@@ ling propositions which emerge through machine translations , show that this technique can not replace a long transl@@ ator for a long time . this applies to some languages very special . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English wor@@ dings in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints which often uses T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for cl@@ ums@@ y reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ Users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be unacceptable or at least harmless . but by large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in future , the City of Kyoto continues to use a seri@@ ousness source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and assur@@ ances on the Internet and on television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Frei@@ es Surf ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , mel@@ ted ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an Internet users will have no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV also wrote no more accessible . &quot;
&quot; other on @-@ channel transm@@ itter shots of the protests in Car@@ acas , which were organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that res@@ ists the government of Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court was dis@@ solved the Parliament and transferred the responsibilities of the Parliament on the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is known , and recommended the users , VP@@ N ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VP@@ N .
it seems that Internet site ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ ani providers are again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , traditional media has been in the reporting of protests in 2014 . at that time , the Commission was going to report about protests with money and locker , as they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this continues to be more favourable than two lit@@ ers of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ ks , later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible , but also two other on @-@ channel stations . this also concerns the website , which the National Assembly met their sessions . &quot;
&quot; earlier follow @-@ up of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that local Internet providers are attri@@ but@@ able to use DNS servers in certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server is faul@@ ty or denied the request when calling for such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS sper@@ mat@@ re : @ el@@ vio oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third party channel , set the transfer on Thursday , April 6 , hired , as the V@@ PI@@ TV camera cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who was transferred live by the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten while he was in a police officers .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to mission .
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government is regulated by the Internet connections : thus the Venezu@@ el@@ ans will always make access to multi @-@ media coverage about the current events in the country . &quot;

Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was a child of Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visited the house in which she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witnesses of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shor@@ tened version of a report by Kur@@ dish , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived for eight years in a household , in which they did not work together with the family who lived there , eat . &quot;
&quot; shortly before their studies at the university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that , from which something has become , &quot; &quot; said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one refers to Paraguay that are more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the shop is quite simple : a large family with little money over@@ gives its inf@@ ant son or her inf@@ ant daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children can afford countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract , which you cannot raise . &quot;
&quot; this practice marked as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous ail@@ ments of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ enga worked for some years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls and young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - sam@@ pled witness and investigated .
&quot; she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ mean itas , guaranteed in general breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family that her daughter is in the faith that they will complete their training to improve their position in society and make something out of itself &quot; to a different family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that takes the girl with himself and justi@@ fies its exploitation by faith that there would be someone a chance that would otherwise get no training and maybe even hungry . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mis@@ led , his family will be experienced many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never know about it .
&quot; in January 2016 the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came into hospital , her body showed traces of fier@@ ce blo@@ ws . shortly thereafter they died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former Mil@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as officials in the population .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived among them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra proposed a long time with a stick to Mar@@ ín , until they suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed the fact that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as a modern form of slavery .
several dozen people came to protest came together and demanded that there is no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows as children registered , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organizations demanded a fast study of the case .
&quot; they want the tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be strong - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go in court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; cri@@ tique are exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when she worked in her father , she had to register , and lost her father his work . &quot;
&quot; your brothers had to go now all , and began to sell on the street or on the market sweets to earn money . &quot;
but they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ enga worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she stood up every morning at 5 p.m. and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
&quot; for example , they clean@@ se the refrigerator , p@@ utz@@ te the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
when the school was at the end she went back home and had time to learn .
&quot; the sooner them finished with learning , the more free time it had . &quot;
&quot; but that time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga says , she never had to be hungry , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick me more books from the library of the landlord than eating out of the fridge , &quot; &quot; reminds them . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party responsible for the dictatorship of Al@@ fredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some se@@ aling of the house@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ enga , next to him and to read our article from Op@@ position@@ ings such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to give the reports of official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but he had not found himself with her . &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who spoke , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would be able to learn &quot; bad habit &quot; that Al@@ var@@ enga , who would speak to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í home again to their native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the formation , which she would allow you to lose . &quot;
&quot; however , it was totally clear that they had been paid for everything they had been paid by them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in the school Al@@ var@@ enga has been discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken , Mob@@ bing and the chic@@ ks to which Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed if they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ ad@@ ita is . &quot;
I was able to invite anyone to my home . I had no friend in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in time , where friend@@ ships arise , I feel particularly clear that I was not part of a group . &quot;

the company cheap the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text on a Facebook group , where you can see advertisements for cleaning personnel and child@@ r@@ ens in Paraguay . &quot;
the administr@@ ators in the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the district of As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please contact you .
&quot; beginning of Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ f@@ th girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ u@@ by , offered their 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the country &apos;s inner , who wants to work . &quot;
then the fas@@ zination adju@@ sts in the ad again once again :
&quot; dear girl@@ friends , I have found a lot . I look at if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , the H@@ asta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , as long still ? ) , a collection of witnesses say former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to establish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( an economic system during the Spanish conquest , which had to reconc@@ ile women of the Guar@@ an@@ í and to their &quot; wives , &quot; the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores who was still prepared to assist in a system of slavery , where they become easy victims for abuse and exploitation . &quot;
social inequality in Paraguay and the vision of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legisl@@ ations writes Egyptian users social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed a bill to &quot; regul@@ ating the regul@@ ators with respect to the use and utility of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law would then be established a place that is charged , citizens and citizens use a permit to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with adoption of the law , users would have to register for users and users on the site of the site with their proper names and recruitment numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do this , that could bring a sentence of up to six months in det@@ ention or money . &quot;
&quot; the bill &apos;s bill , which consists of six plots and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application who runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , vide@@ on@@ ach@@ ment and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced , as the draft should not be informed because Egyptian authorities should not register the registration as Egyptian authorities are unable to register by the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdu@@ l Satt@@ ar , Parliament of parliament and promot@@ ers of the legislative power , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received from telecommunications , user name and password to get through the fire@@ wall , Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; this might mean that Egypt is planning to judge a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . due to those , there would be necessary to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not so far known that such plans pers@@ ist .
experts on @-@ site are skep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist , the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; Egyptian initiative &quot; &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I have doubts about the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , it is so that the same as they are rolled by the physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , then this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system that may apply for a permit or not . and this means a rel@@ ocation to continue the activities of the people and to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically at all realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed during the legislative Parliament and the Constitutional bar before entering the plenary session . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is placed in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in which sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensuring that no altern@@ ation of nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy proposed a legislative action against cy@@ ber crime against cy@@ ber crime , in which a lifetime sentence was intended for those that thre@@ aten to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of the Ir@@ ak work the Ti@@ ersch@@ utz@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the spiritual leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards , which goes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are always less pre@@ y to find . &quot;
why is this specific type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , the Persian Leopard is the only remaining smoking system in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards actually is low in the free hunting way is low and goes against zero . when the team shows in the video that they have a shot of a large cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained Biolog@@ in R@@ aza is passionate about a different side of their country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in trials for six years and studies on wild animals living in the nature of Nature Iraq .

&quot; early March 2017 documented , which had been achieved for the northe@@ ast@@ ern Japan the daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to re @-@ rebuild the lives of those three @-@ fold catastrophe , an ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper is located in Send@@ ai , which is in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture , the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring countries of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iv@@ ata were forced to van@@ ished because the ts@@ un@@ ami had to disappear whole coastal cities of the map .
&quot; in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture of an atomic accident , already alone therefore , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
&quot; the report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o will show the progress made for six years later , in order to re @-@ establish the lives of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese revival and survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; housing in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ato &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( either side by 77 percent of the planned spare parts ) , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ asi@@ ads were completed . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures could mark Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; Iw@@ asi@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses , while at Fu@@ kus@@ hima with 70 percent the final light is formed . &quot;
&quot; however , one still makes every effort still , even six years after the catastrophe , evac@@ u@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald ( by a lot of fun , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts . &quot;
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shipping accommodation .
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iv@@ ate in such homes . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima disaster in 2011 are still living in emergency shel@@ ving , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evac@@ u@@ ated manufacturers were able to det@@ ach after the disaster in Beh@@ avi@@ our . &quot;
&quot; for Iw@@ asi@@ ads , the number is here at 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung was able to determine 10@@ 74 from 1100 schools that were affected by the un@@ happiness , its doors to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures are far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fishing activity in Iw@@ asi@@ ads and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now again in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fishing activity has reg@@ ained its operation . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have moved in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land @-@ large in compassion . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iv@@ ano and less than 50 per cent non @-@ destructive no@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that only a consequence of the Atom@@ ic is unlikely , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares was destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima in the &quot; nu@@ cl@@ ear@@ t cur@@ zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism also has recovered and recovered , but here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off . &quot;
&quot; the economy in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ asi@@ ads are over 90 percent at the same stand , as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ hima on the other hand , only 75 percent can be found here . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reported that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; to determine a total image , the newspaper led numerous respon@@ dents among the native population and under the evac@@ uation . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and also how their emp@@ ties have changed to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in its introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey by going to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local inhabitants , have taken action to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 per cent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention has been done . &quot;
&quot; as it stands for those who have had to evac@@ u@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture , &quot;
&quot; in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung also focused their attention on the situation of the evac@@ u@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only to experience the tremendous earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astro@@ us , atomic fact that Japan had to be experienced . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evac@@ u@@ ated out of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were laid out in areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the date of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cal@@ ami@@ ties , most of the evac@@ uation were getting older than 50 years old . you have to get back in proper per@@ missions , because the efforts for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Iw@@ asi@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima are competing with massive construction projects . this is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will be staged in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries that speak another language , the differences appear to be larger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
after a while one sees however often that a more connects than it seems at first sight .
&quot; these global connections are important , since they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look forward to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get fewer attention in the coverage than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices Members , who take a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over voice and country borders . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ da Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ eta Camar@@ asa explained how the love of music has led to the lack of common language knowledge , while working with people from all over the world , and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care center : last Friday he had taken him a police officers during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nation@@ wide took millions of demonstr@@ ators on a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , the social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a sk@@ ull shepherd &apos;s shepherd and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors op@@ eri@@ ed him on this Saturday and now they sent him into an artificial coma .
its state is considered critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which rapidly spread within a few days rapidly in Brazil . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures , the face of the police officers must recognize that with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the police police officers in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o has been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident in case of active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with its head@@ set on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; would cross a police officers from a prot@@ esters and land on the intention of intensive painting , his face would look for six months on TV , and the whole op@@ ression would therefore be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a press profile of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided the video on the net in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several par@@ ame@@ works shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective is also filmed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state of state , Internet users now have 10,000 Bra@@ Brazi@@ li@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to stay part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while being in hospital . &quot;

police over@@ gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it occurred on the last Friday of brutal police powers against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; polic@@ emen sat in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mi@@ gesch@@ osse and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from speakers on violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ agonist was@@ hes by putting the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window of window . &quot;
&quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted information about a cerem@@ onial glass window , in order to create their title pages illustr@@ ative . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the O Glob@@ o favor@@ ed a title story with one in fire @-@ made bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic cause , more about a dis@@ continuous sli@@ ce than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special cause . &quot;
&quot; this must also recognise , if you are strictly against any form of atomic damage . &quot;
&quot; also here the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportion@@ ately meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are distor@@ ted by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ational course with the police . &quot;
the forgotten villages of Cuba
with the introduction of the Law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar@@ be@@ factories in all of Cuba the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; Greg@@ ory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - no matter what there is no n@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were put in the sugar mills .
&quot; after the spring , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost gradually and according to its facilities , until only the ru@@ mo@@ urs of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to find itself new .
some changed the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ es and pen@@ od@@ les daily to the factories , which are still worse . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 am in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are in the east of the region of sugar factories , which are again in operation after long in@@ active time because they were obtained . &quot;
that was something that he was not expecting .
N@@ ene remember exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would receive the sugar cane factory but the promise has not been kept .
&quot; the sugar cane industry was already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effic@@ ien@@ cies , the bad administrative decision and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the poor harv@@ ests are already no news . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar @-@ industry ?
the old rail journey of the church saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete , and hardly competitive for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production goals amo@@ unted to 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar rate rose from about a decade back . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os are per pounds , according to the 2016 Report of the OECD and FAO , agricultural and nutri@@ tion@@ ists of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the commodity export would be approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day with certainty into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar@@ be@@ ques factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14th May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word that he is most repeated , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
&quot; almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion , not one of them has been informed that the factory would be tac@@ kl@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; so that the place is preserved , they formed a full time - working group . &quot;
the first letters began to come .
&quot; it was officially recognised documents that would only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed , addressing the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister was able to tre@@ ad every withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from there on , the responsibility over and the letters became more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for two years for the breast@@ feeding factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money in operation , in@@ sured he . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was opposed to his will at the stand@@ still of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with any part , that he removed , demon@@ ised one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and more important work@@ places has been eliminated .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for working and services that have been generated in the communities where they were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the present people , when he guaranteed that for five years whose factories were no longer in operation , everything was well run . &quot;
the price of the population for closure of sugar@@ be@@ cu@@ factories
since 2004 sugar@@ cane has been extrac@@ ted only high by M@@ illing .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said , when they began to rec@@ ti@@ ze it , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ted this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories had to look up . &quot;
you have been to spare parts .
&quot; without the perspective of the perspective , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area a grocery factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility continues to be impos@@ ing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty Ern@@ ten bring the old soldiers an ann@@ u@@ ity of two @-@ two p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , there is no down@@ right person , nevertheless , he gives the lies that you told him . &quot;
they saw him for ten years .

first Nations @-@ Young people use Hip Hop to express themselves and preserve your own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them . they do they do with Hip Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour have been bringing mobile studios directly to schools and youth centers , to teach junior groups of song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances . &quot;
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in north @-@ Quebec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked with the C@@ ree Hip Hop @-@ Gruppe The North@@ Stars .
&quot; the workshop therefore assumes that the young Parti@@ cip@@ ants in conversations like &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into sense . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells example the story of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely uns@@ ett@@ led .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video games to convey to how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite influences from globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in Indi@@ gen@@ ous languages , although the young people were not able to master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First nation was recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
the young people involved gave some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hip Hop @-@ Hop that gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree songs .
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an stands at the st@@ rop@@ he in um@@ ance , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel as would not ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
that is the day when you take our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
yet I believe that we will rise up a day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and approach our youth as well
so they can do what they intended for the creator ;
in the comm@@ ent@@ rope the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ Language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also added a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ ben@@ ding ( which is also published on his blog ) :

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are close to the entrance hall sho@@ ku@@ me@@ .@@ pur@@ u ( well being exhibited by everyone , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tical models of dishes &quot; ) , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic courses and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or continue .
there is a whole industry dedicated to producing these plastic materials .
&quot; in the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small companies , which produce even those plas@@ tic dishes that documented the German fil@@ mm@@ akers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a , over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japan these plastic bags are so usual , they don &apos;t even re@@ fresh them out of all . however , a new trend is turning it into show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; in Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ h@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now on sale : new with plastic @-@ decor@@ ating mobile phone @-@ ri@@ bb@@ ons , as shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y , as in this case , cool@@ ers magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ n cool@@ ers mag@@ net for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom of essential values is becoming increasingly expensive .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular maturity shell with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as cell phones .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that keeps your phone ret@@ ains :
&quot; designed to look like an apple with a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of a growing flight into com@@ ic .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phone designer allow you to manufacture your own art work . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon is used , a popular Ticino , served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say , &quot; Wow , cool , now I can feed my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I believe I will be the one .
&quot; this interest in plastic courts may also take a less appe@@ aled form , so as to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our new mobile phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ belts made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the has@@ ht@@ ag # , either a lot of fun in both of everyone . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the popularity of the restaurant industry . such as with the sho@@ ku@@ h@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports and foreign media using the &quot; &quot; fight against drug trading &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the suspic@@ ion and beverages regularly emerge in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy , which brings this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , dr@@ au@@ ded the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent attack , someone hardly look at the star@@ ving or on the congreg@@ ations that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; standing behind every body , behind every bone mar@@ ched in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds may never cure . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with drug trading live &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and told stories of people that gr@@ ated in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime can not just be afraid to fear our lives .
the effects are much profound .
&quot; for example , if businesses are close , because they are threatened by drug retailers and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something as clear@@ ing as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( English : &quot; as fear life changed &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is married every weekend tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , which lost in just one day her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priest : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today to the task that we have put forward to go and to gra@@ ves after the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
&quot; he was 28 , when he disappeared . &quot;
he has three children .
he worked in an elec@@ tro @-@ business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; October 15 , he should be back again , but he never came back . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but that does not pay it out , because they require a ster@@ oids . &quot;
where do we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who face fear . we have to show the international community the conflicts , the br@@ ittle and the cou@@ ps . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk fields .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central @-@ Mexican . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never consider as normal , regardless of what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with the disease and sensor journ@@ alism for some years now .
I get past every day at periods and see the cover pages with pictures that actually can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from experts .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the in@@ difference or sad . it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body once .
I cannot be in@@ compatible with this or consider it as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks that he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders , if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is , as if they war@@ n those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they too have happened . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories to blo@@ wing numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of men is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neigh@@ bor that they were justified &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to talk about such trag@@ e@@ dies , if they are not sti@@ r and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four Mon@@ ths ext@@ or@@ tion in the main city district : like a family with threats , it describes how armed crime month for money from their business , until they were destroyed not only the store , but also their families had been demol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; you think of everything you have lost , and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; the pain of it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back up if you are alone . &quot;
customs have changed , phone numbers also . &quot;
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they included their report with the words : &quot;
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as you don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would solve my deepest feelings , but the answers is no , because I have forgotten how to cri@@ es . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence marked .
in the introduction he casts questions like : who takes care of the child of a mixed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
&quot; what is it to grow , in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ? &quot;
&quot; he is not like other young age of his age , whose parents care for them . &quot;
br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he told that he had to teach himself how to make a egg cook , potatoes br@@ aces , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies which live with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ ap with water , sugar and milk pul@@ ver . &quot;
he tells about the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he said to him that his mother is gone . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood had been past two years earlier , when he was only a few blocks from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father saw that was shot by armed men out of a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez is the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders for public safety and government of the United States government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this is equivalent in the cut 8,5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few of a hundred thousand stories that organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul &apos;s soul .
few stories are still living in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; has established the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drugs , who has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ Users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ ARN@@ ING : this article and the pages that he linked , contain pictures , on which force is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to up@@ lift a ru@@ mo@@ urs or fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how about the years after something the first time has happened ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading as used , trag@@ e@@ dies , which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false cl@@ ut@@ ch of image and event - &quot; wrong &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dr@@ aft News - deny it the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank @-@ carriage put the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped and explo@@ ded . thereby , 230 people came to live . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa has become second @-@ largest country for years and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of stroke , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
trag@@ ically fell on the victim of the petrol station to the victim .
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , the du@@ sting homes , including a cin@@ emas in the vicinity , which was full of people that was full of football world championship . &quot;
houses cur@@ ated and hor@@ se@@ ated cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ mistak@@ able .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ user My@@ stic@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 4@@ ere photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of the fo@@ al bodies , which are up to the ground up while people watch them . &quot;
but here history does not find their end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but in the context of related trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 the fighters of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am the de@@ duc@@ ted villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
eye @-@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically by atro@@ cities that they had to fl@@ ee .
houses and shops have been crus@@ hed and Lei@@ ch@@ name were buried in roads and cer@@ eal .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one was back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were sm@@ elled , shot or burned . &quot;
only by satellite images could be depic@@ ted the follow @-@ up time .
&quot; the occasion for the attack was also uns@@ ol@@ ved , but the armies in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from the year 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture emerged from the Democratic Republic of Congo to be seen as evidence of the fact that the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this abuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ ders ; Africa Check has documented states to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the image has been taken as proof of mass@@ ages .
&quot; still another step further bring personal comments like this example , the picture from the DR Congo , with sources of mass media in relation to supply arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a light@@ ning message , published by the United Nations , those who could fl@@ ee , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following on which these descriptions coinci@@ ded with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an aci@@ an @-@ Arab news page , which was said in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ a Being said , mon@@ ks and politicians could have participated in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to infl@@ ate this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations that AF@@ P was written as their source , had also acci@@ dental Th@@ us this statement , but were not associated with the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false coupl@@ ings range up to the years 2011 and 2012 and indeed come from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed borders . &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ tin has found under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures found that the drawing image from the DR Congo are very similar .
&quot; they come from a mix@@ er private pages , platforms of social media and community and national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed false reports , others have tried to compens@@ ate the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; we have examples for the ab@@ used usage and linked them to the respective countries , based on what site they have been published . by doing so , we want to show the reach more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the listed countries listed below ( which were also connected in some cases ) , several examples of abuse . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be used completely ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; the generated countries indicate to pages or servers , about the examples of f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ ood are still available . &quot;

&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of the use of the image from the DR Congo , and on the one hand a T@@ we@@ et , the sympathy opposite the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger that were persec@@ uted , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya . however , the photos of it were used . &quot;
Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the government of Myanmar released a jud@@ gement on what she said to be &quot; &quot; inten@@ tionally fin@@ alised news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding concerning Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this judges , which is only published in English , also contains references to f@@ ake images of sc@@ af@@ firm@@ ors that operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to dar@@ ed that Muslims kill the Budd@@ hist@@ s and other sr@@ um ( which is often used by bur@@ mes@@ an nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this message mistak@@ enly claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein being 2012 was given , that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture continues to contain .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article of 2014 on students , which were killed by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the K@@ ál@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly explained that the picture is not derived from the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar h@@ egem@@ ony attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ acre of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ ery@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ nam@@ ya@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is bur@@ ns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo emerged , provided with this t@@ witter@@ has@@ ht@@ ag , and delet@@ es a discussion among Muslims under the mass@@ acre of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities were taking these events , the mut@@ ated in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
United States , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was saved as proof of the mass@@ acre of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 . but the messages that were connected with it were picked up in no religious context .
&quot; instead , the goal was to attract attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media reporting compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Arabic ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that supposedly has been written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; over the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , in turn , discussion about how this is presented to the Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to the wrong . &quot;
&quot; from the message where the picture was included in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) , ink Eye also points out : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date c@@ ach@@ ets do exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and disp@@ ense them via image file related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which only appeared to the original un@@ gl@@ ade of 2010 , the picture ultimately bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that under@@ go these po@@ sts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the proceeds of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mut@@ ations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fro@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated by a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to investigate how images can be used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is however what happens when readers can no longer give these images longer . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are sixty people who have been inten@@ tional to exercise the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ ger this mood of faul@@ ty and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and narro@@ wer it the actual di@@ gest of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the distribution of extensive images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
an argument is that the with@@ hold of pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al equ@@ alled to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , concern that violent pictures readers and spect@@ ators des@@ en@@ si@@ zing the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , who studied how much for@@ s@@ ame media seem to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss cre@@ denti@@ ary depic@@ tions in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologists experim@@ entations , because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will have to think about the situation where an image does something that actually can be used , but also dis@@ solved from the context or completely ab@@ used manner . &quot;
&quot; however , any examination fal@@ si@@ ders should also take into account as internationally they can . &quot;

a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( for example . un@@ plac@@ eable ) attempts to offer a selection of words from all over the world who are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are in each language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
&quot; some of these uns@@ ur@@ b@@ able words are already known already well ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) , and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) . &quot;
but all resist@@ ances stand stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; one word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have already been collected for a period of time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
in the blog you can find example words from the VAT language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u as :
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &apos; - pamper@@ ing you to your parents in recognition of how to put you in your younger years .
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ wick language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or nu@@ is@@ ness that you feel after you have wondered about cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they de@@ pose different cultures , de@@ cri@@ es other thought @-@ sounds and ar@@ ouse our new@@ gi@@ er@@ de . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of this &quot; un@@ matched &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is moving with the worst Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently looking at the worst high @-@ water and sof@@ tening disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by mon@@ soon , which is usually ended in late May , are due to strong ra@@ inf@@ all the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
after an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing for the floods and battles .
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected by over 400 000 people since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe place of stay . &quot;
&quot; the rains left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas were slowly coming back . &quot;
health and hygien@@ ic relationships are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the floo@@ d@@ disaster :
&quot; flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the high water situation . &quot;
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eb@@ le crisis , war@@ ns save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ all are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the flood , water stood up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle too floo@@ ded because of the last covered water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the air @-@ weapon has five air@@ planes for lif@@ egu@@ ards provided and further five are made available for transportation of shipment for the residents in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also explained to help .
Facebook sites such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka supply important information on high @-@ water situation and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue calls for their operations require , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate the dry foods and vital goods for high water @-@ offering -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
&quot; please call them the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals need help in this area . &quot;
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ ast@@ o @-@ centre is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; high @-@ water aid &quot; button , which allowed the users to pick up a vehicle for picking up of assistance and donations . these were then distributed for free to the s@@ lan@@ k@@ ic Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they led a &quot; SOS &quot; key that had more than thousand requests and 150 successful jet@@ ties for the result of flood and Er@@ dr@@ ut@@ sche closed people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kas , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , they bring residents in need of safety and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

use approved . Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love friend .
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she trust me her children ; she is my rock in fire . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women . &quot;
in the next sk@@ andi@@ c we are rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are in a sea of rain @-@ arms and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound by an American flag , other sk@@ andi@@ zing slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend look at me and says , &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims , I ask myself . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their conception . &quot;
it is mus@@ li@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with this , to be a Muslim on different species but somehow we all put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer is in our collective idea so well constructed that as soon as Muslims , that as I do not fit in , un@@ mus@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
un@@ mus@@ li@@ zed
I am not alone so .
&quot; this is even what has happened to the poet , whose poetry in America is most sold : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images do you come in mind when you think about him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x@@ er mus@@ li@@ er pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; this Del@@ ete makes a large part of the history of 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims in this world . &quot;
&quot; another consists in the reduced visual images of Muslims , Western books have been coloni@@ zed for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting speech is determined by the dark man who should fear and the exotic woman who should save .
the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ assembled the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures are also reflected today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood they continue . &quot;
&quot; I worked for three years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ atives domin@@ ate our news fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; that Nar@@ rati@@ v fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from being forced to wear their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and to cover sau@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group practices its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim Women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it is the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American citizens of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , who were here to have been here with slave @-@ ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination , so deep and faul@@ ty that often si@@ kh men and children become the aim of anti @-@ imperialist attacks and sh@@ allo@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories , which we tell and due to the way we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
among the 1,@@ 7 billion are part of the &quot;
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives that help us understand the world .
&quot; and my industry is amazing to record the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
and we are here failed to make seven million Muslims form the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants from the first generation , resulting from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard to the sky@@ scrapers of New York . sky@@ scrapers were made possible through the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time when Khan met the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ um@@ erable Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but now I am unhappy about Muslims and Americans ?
&quot; sometimes , if people wonder why I don &apos;t get por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or make my hand@@ craft recipes that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; from respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I Scher@@ ze , we do not carry all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ ans with us . &quot;
we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists who seek to fight far spread lies above Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ known Islam@@ hos@@ tile mechanical machine with borro@@ wers , th@@ ink tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ oods which is already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and due to the way we tell them , it consists of anti @-@ hos@@ tility to more than just a stran@@ ger that has a woman the head@@ scar@@ f . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ anian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neigh@@ bor , my neigh@@ bor in the Brand@@ y see that I am Muslims if they could see through the 15 metre of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the all@@ ab@@ ative ritual with my daughter when I sat down in my arms and her the Arabic verses to protect the Qur &apos;an and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and evil that you cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ous faith is probably not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its completed and un@@ finished painting , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters that they can almost imagine . &quot;
&quot; Muslims , to be the prayers of talking about who she said to me , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Muslims said to be , as she brought to me , to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that was founded through centuries - through a &quot; &quot; Empire &quot; , &quot; which was founded a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tish Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ Komp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only master . &quot;

&quot; belonging to knowing that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , their families , as with my grandfather , who have been torn apart from coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world like the game . &quot;
&quot; Muslims said to be to know that in the last two centuries Europeans are all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it means to know that the first fli@@ erb@@ om@@ be of history was turned out in a century over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , a Swedish , col@@ li@@ ous sub@@ tan of the British empire , led by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means to remember that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military forces , with troops being distributed over every continent apart from Antarc@@ tica , went to Iraq to chase the mass destruction of weapons that are not existed . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ir@@ aker buried in the w@@ asting of the war .
one American Muslims means to know that the self @-@ murder in veter@@ ans have increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that if a tragedy carries the US , and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story of four times will be reported as a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that before four@@ teen years of the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , created by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought into this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth , which I sen@@ sed as people take over the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;

&quot; a Americ@@ an@@ er to be a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple bonds , but to fail to re@@ communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion has more possibilities than a mag@@ ician , but is represented in the reduced branches of &quot; &quot; against &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother , means to care about my child and all the Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people in this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ hos@@ tility exists in the Muslim govern@@ ors , which began President Bush and have been extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists of transi@@ tional monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in immigration , which takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it consists in a country that closes its borders towards people from just the countries , which is bom@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; it is a wrong and neb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; , &quot; which largely takes Arabs and Muslims into the sight . &quot;
they are the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs we ab@@ st@@ ain on Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and due to those who we do not tell , we are today here . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically uns@@ atis@@ fied image and b@@ aking them , to judge groups on a scale of 1 and 100 with regard to evolution . &quot;

&quot; we stand decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous or@@ atory prints , which we toler@@ ate in our news editorial departments . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , who tried to grasp our often related identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;

&quot; but I &apos;m worried because of this difficult global point of time , in which we are . &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for the conspir@@ acy the@@ orists that existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House lead . &quot;
they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they have made Muslims for &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially , by taking the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a couple of years ago it had not yet been given , but now they domin@@ ate great areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and history of which I was not aware of , when I was as old now , but I have made my daughter today about an un@@ covered Muslims . &quot;
things I have left here as a burning track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memory , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions that makes our humanity a story , where anyone else is made to a &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conventions are held in the framework of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers . &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people carried by the creation of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago of the Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we must ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of this , conscious and un@@ aware of the &quot; others , &quot; as it is my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because he won &apos;t have a president , the chocolate tree , while he is already broken down countries and &quot; towards others , &quot; he goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .

can there be one way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treasure Hill Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the re@@ count of stories in their original language a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently over another initiative of Steven Bird , the in@@ transl@@ atable blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not being written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS already has undertaken events , the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not be passed on to the children . &quot;
for the creators of the project is :
&quot; the mass die of the languages of the world can be avoided if we manage cities , accept diversity , secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are , around da@@ h . &quot;
&quot; when they are often related to understanding , &quot; to understand these events instead &apos; the listening to cher@@ ish to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers put their story first in their own language and translate them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , they conduct their devotion and their representation that the audi@@ ences are encouraged . &quot;
they call laugh and emotions that the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; for example , the following video shows for example a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou is also the opportunity to explain for their country typical customs of nar@@ ration . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the fork of the rab@@ bits and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; having explained the meaning of his beak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; How is that to an audience , that your language does not understand ? &quot; with a wide dit@@ ches he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were very happy with me !
so far the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have occurred in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this . all those inspired by the project may contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .

&quot; the people Puerto Ri@@ cos demands that the politicians , ben@@ ches and government agencies responsible for debt to be held responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial test and a leading committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation which in favor of the economy operates . &quot;
we will be pressing and oppressed .
the people Puerto Ri@@ cos refused to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king deposits .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state of integrated territory of the USA - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a ruling non @-@ profit organization without party membership with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; from outside the measures imposed on the participation and conviction of the citizens are at risk , to be rejected by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the Syrian Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open net . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : publi@@ ca , the annual conference on the digital culture , which is oriented in Berlin , dedicated an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director by called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , las@@ ered excer@@ pts from the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective re@@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which has been published last year and is listed here license @-@ free , contains a number of approaches , which deal with the free culture in the face of repression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction there is :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge , and which are the real costs with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have side by side to be over the fo@@ g that our new@@ s@@ ander is surrounds and in order to create something from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , who borro@@ wed the beloved and folded internet volunteers , who has been incar@@ cer@@ ated since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was rep@@ ain@@ ted from the directory of the A@@ dra pris@@ ons in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or location . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that wants to push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , namely immediately . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to let us think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we today here ?
why have we decided ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extre@@ mi@@ ties ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in prison sy@@ r@@ ischer government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; military police is based on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported , she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who took note of himself as the insi@@ der @-@ Assad government and took note of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his place of stay and condition remain unknown but still unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , bass played a crucial role to expand access to the internet and knowledge to the general public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment of the leader of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prot@@ esters was pres@@ i@@ ent than the work , which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arche@@ ological sites of the world , was the Way@@ kreu@@ z numerous civi@@ lizations , and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture of architecture with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put it all , this architecture that not only em@@ bo@@ died the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip into the digital arche@@ ology and the conservation has created a time @-@ capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not yet complete this project before . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call its name .
Bass@@ el brought me English even when he was already in custo@@ dy .
&quot; I learned to read English well , to write and speak . &quot;
&quot; he always has his knowledge with each being shared , who has asked . he has taught other det@@ ention to read English and speak . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened me the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also contributed to other prisoners as they use computers , at least theoretically without having actually holding them in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ filing , which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 when he was in custo@@ dy . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura worked together in the book together .
she said the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them out of the Arabic into English .
the book is licens@@ or available .
cover of Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens at any visit ;
&quot; that I fail in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment , in which we embrace you , &quot;
&quot; that any of the dangers is no matter , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , Fes@@ ls and watch@@ men &quot;
I forget the cr@@ ush of prison
and I dr@@ inge every detail your voice and words
I am with passion for me
when your eyes would say
and I let another piece of my soul ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to get back all of the moments
and about your absence to sore and smile .
I over@@ finished myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment by Bass@@ el wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
a Year goes my soul
during
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
bo@@ iler &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) have disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under non @-@ violence through the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , Am@@ nest@@ y International has died in jail for 2011 at the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption le@@ ased director after prison sentence again on previous post
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ kaner re@@ acted with anger on a cor@@ rup@@ ture case , in which a ruling member states returned to the workplace at the state apparatus , where the corruption was committed . &quot;
this is a talking about Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other def@@ endants ( approximately 800 000 euro ) to 22 years imprisonment .
the money carried out by public funds from Mos@@ ambi@@ que and their council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately called his re @-@ setting in the company what happened on 19 April .
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office , the proposal submitted , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ b@@ aza to resume its old post , as the company did not accomplish a discipline . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not good . &quot;
&quot; the Center for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , briefly C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , distributed in an interview with Deutsche Welle made the decision of the company to resume the Director . &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption , and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a set@@ back with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we have to note is that the company should also have a lack of discipline in opposition to the states .
&quot; the company &apos;s wie@@ c apparently , however , and illustr@@ ates no proper legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ an social media , re@@ jects this behaviour as well and regards the case as a &quot; &quot; resistant &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza were a competent type , he would be consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and that half of them had shed . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could give advice and his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has frozen , into the company is rein@@ t@@ ated , which he helped make damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be paid for his silence . &quot;
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ ans and student of political science in Brazil , says the director of no morality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state , because he did not believe it , I cannot believe in such a way that the state has already suffered so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but it has only served itself by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as a hand it turned around an in@@ exhaus@@ tible financial source and the state itself has become tired , pr@@ un@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , I do not know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remind you that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are among the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans will not only be remembered for ever as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , cutting edge , and - at the door of the proph@@ etic red@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he insi@@ cally confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of making the f@@ ather@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interests to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious person changes my experience that is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not address his ambitions . &quot;
an ambitious man is at the same time crimin@@ ally . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions also were tr@@ aded :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he was riding 10 years and came free .
and today it sets up the firm upon which he de@@ pu@@ ff@@ y the money again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ δ@@ Psychology ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users
the bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ ig@@ b@@ se .

&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their po@@ sts out of the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although about the origin of the word still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people with indi@@ an origin or in general used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or a part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma within the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements of the word has given an extremely pic@@ tured killing .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that most commonly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight a speech in Myanmar , the company has c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; in this case , Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ Kal@@ ar may normally be associated with racism but the word itself is not automatically called Hass@@ an . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed his hand , c@@ ens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ically also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( Cam@@ el ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( curtain ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ users A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he enth@@ uses the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in spiritual nature , whether they knew his back pain , by doing a word . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ y@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ically - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; in Win , zin Win is the opinion that they will reduce the@@ atri@@ cal nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook analytical must be analytical , which spreading out all Po@@ sts that are committed in suspic@@ ion of racism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automation is not understood what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyze the post carefully and control it by checking the side words .
&quot; for example , Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( altern@@ ator ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that this dirty nation@@ alists spread , to spread the Hass@@ an , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ed its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often gets a cat@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users can easily start social networks to express a new word or an alternative description of the sti@@ ff word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ze is described as Facebook began to delete his posts , as he just wanted to share his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and was prohibited by Facebook , posting and parts of content for 24 hours because the post office &quot; &quot; the Facebook Community Standards has not been met . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Po@@ sts of people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate @-@ speaking nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that nothing has to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post the author divided his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are badly . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform but it does not work .
such words to c@@ ensor will only bring more hat@@ red within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; P@@ ea curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out they have made mistakes , they tried not to correct the fal@@ si@@ sted Po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if only a little bit more respect for the 15 million benefits , they would give them a big turnover would be the great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship is made available to users for much disp@@ atch among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users will now make sure via Facebook funny and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ an , to see whether their po@@ sts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some Screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , which contains no Hass@@ an language , but still removed : &quot;

the Bur@@ m@@ ical text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch an inheritance curr@@ y and an Indian film .
&quot; just to try out whether Facebook contains the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to extend their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should also meet the violence in the churches in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
Facebook was given for his failure to dec@@ eive the da@@ zz@@ ling hate speech on its bur@@ mes@@ an pages under control .
&quot; but instead of taking the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better ongoing to sw@@ allow themselves more on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned of them . &quot;

the children of children is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously to adopt a law that is to offer this practice , so that the most powerful age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change of adul@@ thood , some members stopped in practice , and in May 2016 it came to a large public out@@ cry . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aja , the leader of the inter @-@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group that does not inter@@ fere with the representatives of the various religious groups of the country that the state did not inter@@ fere with the state , age , age not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of UN children &apos;s rights , the min@@ ors than , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children , who were married to 15 percent , in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8,@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistics of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 . &quot;
&quot; online petition and social media movements that stri@@ ves to produce laws for children before , followed at the foot and pleas@@ ing great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Hin@@ du leader for example had no concerns , the critics of the children &apos;s roe , they should try to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition sor@@ es for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point of doubt if the opposition would agree to the Legisl@@ ation of the Legisl@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2017 , the bill &apos;s throw was decided against the children of children , despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority could make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree and pro@@ claim the law .
&quot; one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators from Facebook gave an status update on Facebook , which was posted in Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again : &quot;
&quot; Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill &apos;s bill against the children of children , was decided in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and no one against it . &quot;
&quot; after having decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media user was thrilled because the laws were finally changed to the children &apos;s children .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has all too much time and un@@ necessary talk that has hidden the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children of children is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago , and that is almost every price . &quot;
&quot; during A@@ bel Jackson the opinion , it was definitely long enough to put the practice was Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas over@@ looked so that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which was be@@ ating : , Her@@ l@@ ative news ! &quot;
the Eh@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; the Fol@@ ota of Mut@@ ota , which belonged to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , which spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was , commented : &quot;
the delicate age in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religion of religion .
&quot; the draft for the amendment of the Eh@@ es@@ es@@ etz@@ es was voted today , on June 9 , 2017 , decided . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , there are 41 members and there were 35 members at the vote . &quot;
&quot; all members , who have been eligible for the law . &quot;
the children &apos;s before is no longer permitted in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ ag@@ ei@@ tor@@ ch .

&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aja therefore , the Secretary General of the S@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aja has announced his intention to take a judicial step , the law should be adopted ; and he seems to rede@@ em his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the general contractor Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , meant it is quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aja wants to proceed against the law , the most social media users would approach the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , when we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that we have to speak of the problem , our daughters to them , that they may be of great , hard @-@ minded men that are facing , would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it is now to be a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s rights are legal or still the norm , although there are laws which they say . &quot;

&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform issued all Turkish Wikipedia pages at its de@@ centr@@ alised Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. machine @-@ machine connections ) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;
the content is available in spite of the legislative pro@@ hibition .
in a blo@@ mail IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put it all that snap@@ shots from Wikipedia , on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and shared way . &quot;
&quot; this can help the users to see at least all the Wikipedia contents , even if you cannot reach the website www.@@ black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also involved , that this step is independent of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is just about screen@@ shots and no li@@ ve@@ - or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to cope with sperm . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mir@@ ror@@ Page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to create similar mir@@ ror@@ Pages , if in the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as employee in Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
&quot; one attacks on another URL that is not the original one . that what you can see , is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially , the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the content from Wikipedia yourself then when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
because this is run by a server that is not in Turkey .
a ne@@ pal@@ es@@ ischer Wild@@ tier@@ photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection
&quot; a su@@ mp@@ tuous rhin@@ oc@@ eros , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poorly positioned moti@@ fs and well @-@ balanced colors . &quot;
&quot; the motivated him even to wear a camera with himself , and trying to ra@@ vel the situation . &quot;
at that time he was a kid .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar is looking forward to bringing back to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his homeland right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that ste@@ er the attention to Nepal . &quot;
he described on Facebook as it helps him to help him with his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! &quot;
&quot; I sat at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) , he had a call from my father , that at the banks of the Rap@@ ti River would be a leop@@ ard . &quot;
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
I immediately ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the leop@@ ard was and I immediately began to cr@@ ammed pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar aims to gain cooperation with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nep@@ as Nature , and wishes to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood out tigers , already from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not be disturbing from the point of view of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ har@@ ks appeared . he immediately drew near , we see ourselves and he rigi@@ dly through the S@@ al trees ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ nature and wild animals is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days long , and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist information . &quot;
check out some of these photos below .

&quot; this article was draf@@ ted by Kay@@ ona@@ az Kaly@@ m@@ a and originally appeared on Video Volunte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was released here as part of a content sharing Convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even of older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use an pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pr@@ ad@@ esh give women to respect that they should respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should ab@@ ide by the norm . &quot;
&quot; the last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a through a head@@ court of the village , and rejected by her family and the village of the village , after they had stopped an hal@@ ted relatives . &quot;
&quot; tradition their wives also do not name on behalf of name , is also common among men . however , they have far less conditions to fear if at all , they should not get involved in this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health care , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and so quickly became the main topic of the city . &quot;
it is a place just for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is operated by the community of Video Volunte@@ ers , and stands for the reduction of patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was worked for seven years with the help of her video camera to un@@ cover practices , such as children &apos;s homes and AIDS , and heads these clubs . &quot;
they reported how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them an amb@@ assador of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini presented in its discussion round , was the case of women who do not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation over the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; to speak the name of her husband , he is not according to utter@@ ance , is a burning that they are all charged and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
that tradition testi@@ fied that a woman wants her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not toler@@ ate this , is regarded as being depos@@ ited , as a woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round and never thought about it .
&quot; at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who has never called the name of her husband so far before , at home , try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband was still too long after the video was at the end .
&quot; Pr@@ ak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I would call him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in his luggage Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; . &quot; some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pr@@ ad@@ esh . &quot;
&quot; after the vide@@ o@@ projection , the women trying to get the discussion with a exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini bat every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , aff@@ ection@@ ate , aff@@ ection@@ ate , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the br@@ isk of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which women may never speak the name of her husband . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she took only in the whole exercise ; a different chose to let the full swing of frustration against him and his family by removing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an ancient Br@@ other , the women decided that she would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands in the name . &quot;
and they held their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife could not stop his name . &quot;
another cl@@ ub@@ member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she moved , she got fear and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I would do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less comprehen@@ sible and the situation of art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop different practices , such as wearing the galvan@@ ic red point on the forehead , who shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the galvan@@ ic red point , if he would do it too . &quot;
he laughs only and I listened to him to bear him .
&quot; the other women did not stop completely with them , but think they are now in a better position to choose even to do it in some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing a trip with every discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what could hear , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; for the first time they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and s@@ angen , and spoke about things that had never been thought of before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have made some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are connected to our sp@@ ouses , have never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothing .
some women in the group have been carried by Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ary @-@ spa , a broad @-@ shirt over a p@@ ants , wear ; they have not dre@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clos@@ ets , mor@@ als connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , jewellery Roh@@ ini their own pair of Kur@@ dish ( Upper hem@@ den ) into a discussion , so that women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next they decided now to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed something , Roh@@ ini , that things slowly enter roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of her husband &apos;s name to say . &quot;
&quot; some , including myself , make it even , but only if they are alone and not any other family members . &quot;
only one or two will continue to say the name of her husband ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot at their forehead .
&quot; women in the discussion field know that changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the sol@@ v@@ ein to be more freedom of movement , or their own clos@@ ets - at the end of a hard to navi@@ ating river . &quot;
&quot; as they give each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
&quot; but this club , each of us gives us confidence that something will change . &quot;
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . it will give a chain reaction if every woman goes back home and other people about what we talk about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the Mil@@ ange district , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
&quot; one of the victims was found , and part of the organs were taken . &quot;

it is the first time that consecutive attacks in Moz@@ ambi@@ que were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group that is the purpose of mut@@ ations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 led a mission in the South African country to investigate these intern@@ ships .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably only recently made .
this story was originally published on 8th July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published within a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the nomin@@ ative Chinese disp@@ idents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community , after his lawyer was announced at the end of June , that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the final stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( prosec@@ ution ) after he was involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to which the democratic reforms in China was involved . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China has referred to as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and told a speaker , he did not need it as &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this cause with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China receives further views from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or give him treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ red the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , an spokes@@ man turned out to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow li@@ u abroad . &quot;
Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to the Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 has been awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government came to do nothing with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations have only been continued during December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the Sal@@ mon on China since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; once the message had circul@@ ated that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought its hopes for unconditional release to express and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
due to his det@@ ention he was not able to take its price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament passed a resolution to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China to the release of Li@@ us , as they announced in an explanation on 30 June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet all the visits and receive , which they wish , and be able to communicate free with the outside world . &quot;
USA
&quot; US Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad distributed with that the Americans &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility for treatment abroad , in that respect it will help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Poll@@ ey , gave the message agency AF@@ P on 27 June announced that the message to release Chinese authorities , not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from its house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US message moved an angry response from China to himself , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere with an ir@@ responsible and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
poll@@ ey shared with that China should offer the couple :

&quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ kl@@ ey and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife uncondi@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o uncondi@@ tionally so that he can move into a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;

&quot; Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin , I hope Li@@ u &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed to the visit in Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on June 28 , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on to provide adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to provide him from his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us An@@ lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us Ms , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always allows the room in the hospital and that it Li@@ u is not permitted with someone outside , including his lawyers , talk and contact . &quot;

&quot; Canada calls for China to maintain its international human rights obligation , including free speech , to maintain and release the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
France &apos;s State Department called China on a Declaration on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family shall have contact with him . &quot;

&quot; the Council of the debate matters in Taiwan demanded China on 27 June to release Li@@ u , and to demonstrate a greater tolerance against those who call for peaceful funding to make political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ w@@ anese leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on to allow China to treat sufferers of intellectual Li@@ u , in Taiwan . &quot;

Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may appear sil@@ ly as Singapore is recognized at an international level as independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Minister K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore was regarded as a city . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Law@@ yers @-@ Association of the State of New York , the Minister expressed that many people cri@@ tici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he support that Singapore was to be considered as a city .
nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to turn its logic to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ es , this valuable country , you hear that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had a lack of escape in front of the responsibilities . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons for Shan@@ gr@@ in was not very no@@ bel : it def@@ ends an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , in view of what he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore or New York should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the subject , the good old cor@@ es of the author@@ itarian Mach@@ th@@ ans appears to be the vor@@ ed democr@@ ats , the twi@@ sted logic , as they fit better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the last week of Shan@@ gr@@ in , the answers to his American guests were given to our press , our Ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ts with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng invites Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to illustrate his opinion since they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally think it is a bit difficult to sw@@ allow .
&quot; Singapore is not a country , but a city is , thus to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ gr@@ at would take the effort to clarify this point unless he was paid up , in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by adding on the blog his comment , he points to reading the critics concerning the critics of the conference so that one could understand the context of the statements made by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country . &quot;
read the wor@@ ding .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a city &quot; &quot; be a country , &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so un@@ equally important , even if we enjoy free and just choices . &quot;
he started Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party in decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; was not a country , &quot; he obviously does not say it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am who is as the leader of a her@@ an@@ ical generation such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; I am above what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which I am expecting to do with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes that he is really aware of what he defended . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review ref@@ lies the weaknesses of Shan@@ gr@@ in &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; believed an error &quot; &quot; or was it a freel@@ ancer ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally country and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ gr@@ in is of severe importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the Singapur of Christ make their military service , they only defend their city but not their land ? &quot;
who must pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always was a city : &quot;
&quot; I have not said , what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have ten@@ ded a lot of Lon@@ lier ...
nobody ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defence of the country above all &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather talk of the defence of the city .
the myth of &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
screenshot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices questioned his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your home or home country ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors to be revealed about certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et should be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question that is asked me most in Japan , is : &quot; &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , I answered . &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is regarded as pol@@ itely to show interest in his conversation by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; on my clari@@ fications then most often the default answer : &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook maybe in@@ war@@ dly in front of anger , if they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t bother@@ ed it . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many can@@ adi@@ ans have a can@@ adian flag clearly visible at their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ...
&quot; it was also earlier than I began 20 years ago , through the world - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the march to Iraq and before 11 September . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le blades in their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare !
for us there is no weapons !
gender equality have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Canada is supposedly regarded as the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like this guy south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first of all , I have many American friends I admired . &quot;
it would make me nothing if you would change myself with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first of all : as &quot; nice &quot; to be called , basically , sp@@ ie@@ ty to be - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian twin ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing where you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; harmless to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting , and no attention to deserve . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good , if one wants to un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around us . &quot;
&quot; I would even come as far as to say , that the desire to be free and alone , a leading part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; what outdoor &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence up with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I do with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au came the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans more than just &apos; nice . our prime minister has made Canada quite sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a music video released in Thailand , the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ zed , which took power in 2014 and restore the civil government in spite of their promises to restore the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told him which rules him his girlfriend .
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video is indirectly related to the persistent military domination of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was an amazing success .
&quot; the first three days alone was divided on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 254 times , and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video has been blocked in Thailand after a group of activists organized the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics , as it stands with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; look at once these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that have per@@ sever@@ ed in Thailand over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may be referred to in the dr@@ ak@@ onal section of 44 of the provisional Constitution , which provides the com@@ mander @-@ in @-@ charge on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the advis@@ ing program to the &quot; setup &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are regarded as critics as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to compens@@ ate activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit has been set up in the army , monitored on the online content and individuals who have been thrown , the monarchy will destroy the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand sets a strike against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( majest@@ y ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , Thailand was established in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase , their decision is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security professionals she war@@ ned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax funds . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it will even be shown how persons are thrown into a black carrier , before they bring them into an intercom camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they were supposed to have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and have access to internet users , they should refrain from the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , which was used the sal@@ ute of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues to be seen in the ruins of the Gei@@ ster@@ cities in the Eastern @-@ East Asia .

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society is very slow to recover in East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ as@@ hic war has been officially finished , but its s@@ cars are still strong visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the Northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ f@@ antasi@@ es . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , gradu@@ ates , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together at Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the majority of Russians and waste are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ho@@ ist@@ y towns .
&quot; in the post @-@ war period , more than 10.000 people lived there are only a few hundred people in these spirits . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district of 16@@ ,000 people since it was scar@@ ed over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story buildings of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chev &apos;s ch@@ u@@ kow@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and quite rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard to end this .
&quot; this is all a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still clear . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable splend@@ or buildings .
&quot; people who once lived in this place and had their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have now deser@@ ted the district . &quot;
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a in the other villages it looks similar .
&quot; K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chen@@ ow@@ ka , which can accommodate one or two families , one can recognize to the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , she immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our mother was forbidden to us that we let us photograph , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she has just forbidden to us , that is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed her girlfriend something to and suddenly she left the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small tur@@ qu@@ oise mining enterprise named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the Sub@@ si@@ sten@@ cy industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as zo@@ ot@@ echni@@ cs and vegetables .
it is difficult to get over the l@@ aps .
the district management supplies the winter for free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I do not know what is going to happen , but we will build zu@@ c@@ chini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; in spite of her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave the f@@ antasi@@ es to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in f@@ antasi@@ es , &quot; &quot; tells them . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial assistance from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine Dollar .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; gives them to . &quot;
T@@ ante G@@ alya tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot constantly do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour on the balcony appears . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , &quot; calls a@@ unt G@@ alya to her . &quot; they said that we could build zu@@ c@@ chini . &quot;
I already prepared the ground .
&quot; I do not know what is going to happen , but we will build zu@@ c@@ chini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as &apos;s part@@ ying in Nat@@ asch@@ a has lived together with her husband and five common children in their house for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when war started .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right .
I remember every day how the city and war once were .
&quot; when our conversation stood at the end , a little boy is passing by us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy he h@@ unted to him .
he plays with the ball and then rolling up the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw on the dec@@ ayed building . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are a part of their childhood , which care for in@@ authenticity in their lives . &quot;

in Mexico home &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants at their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ac@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org , and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the path of migrants , the Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula he is located at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ olds , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ gest@@ ell and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy @-@ form . &quot;
it is called Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ac@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many among the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become an destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ ti@@ ans who are on the journey .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for approximately 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with ch@@ atting , cru@@ m@@ bling walls , and beds made of metal . &quot;
there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants here come here .
&quot; sometimes Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people are talking to full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cart@@ ons . &quot;
she wants to reject nobody .
&quot; she helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medications that they can not pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ sam that depl@@ eted the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if mom Africa is a more appropriate nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i that has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the cordi@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and three children .
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States , to make normal a first stop in South America and then pull toward the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other departure of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a known name on the route , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ ti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans often travel the route and that the Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as a buil@@ ders on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest in Mama Africa since months : he sold SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money , to buy the B@@ usti@@ cket to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I wonder if he is in contact with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; he smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests can send their often text messages if they have gone to gr@@ asp@@ ing them or to report her over the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to the chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very famous here , but it is not the only funk hope for the migrants that travel through Tap@@ ac@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valencia and his family have taken migrants in their small house . &quot;
it is a polic@@ eman and has found that the B@@ usti@@ ckets can be sold to numerous African migrants .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for a dollar per night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleeping on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen place outside . &quot;
Valencia explains that he knows what our guests are doing .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ac@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez told me that he had fled with his wife and three children who wanted to be black@@ ma@@ iled by him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and a familiar , a single @-@ known , has offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family lives still there and tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa is all back full of guests .
in the courses the travellers quiet their phones .
&quot; a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about her home , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grand@@ mother , she sang her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ genuine , which you made a customer in , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and Old . &quot;
&quot; she laughs , while she is ready to imagine it briefly . &quot;
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repeat them each time . &quot; &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
&quot; China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app , on their mobil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter @-@ user , more than 40 per person at their disposal . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities in the west of China , are forced to install a Spy@@ ware on their mobil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users received in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Uru@@ m@@ qi a mobile mail alert , in which they called the district government , a surveillance app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in communication , the app will be said to have access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities must also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed shortly after they had installed the app , news with a private We@@ chat Group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police that the app could determine the sources and distribution routes of terrorists and follow , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ob@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block porno@@ graphic websites , of online fraud , Tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and in order to control your own home network . &quot;
this app with the fil@@ tering for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many different ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers can manage the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or create it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while announ@@ cements on digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , liber@@ ated ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme assur@@ ances and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ eal Internet inter@@ circuits . &quot;
&quot; the press @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( , &quot; &quot; Pictures from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; ) showed photos from a check@@ point where the polic@@ emen had to re @-@ checked by a check@@ point where they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without these software , they might be incar@@ cer@@ ated up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they have comp@@ elled the people to use devices , which are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of imprisonment through the rest of the world .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( , &quot; &quot; Ph@@ Ds &quot; &quot; ) released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus gets restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city of Party , to minimize the distribution of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government offices , authorities and with the party , including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office when operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report of Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all the inhabitants and entrepreneurs until the 1st of August their &quot; &quot; personal ID cards , hand@@ ys , external drives , portable hard disk , hard disk drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; however , this action is in@@ ju@@ red by Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and giving them pen@@ alties for quite a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death : part 1 : everything falls after death
a single cell built in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane signs his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and ask that you are all alone in one place where all the most important is gone . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually resolved , and an truth revealed , which is clearly identifiable , both from inside and outside . &quot;
one which makes its name every honor .
one that has dropped into a list of feelings and expres@@ sions which do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you come back the reality , and you walk behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters into being out of flesh and blood , and everything falls after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts solve yourself in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is moving up on the A@@ xis of Un@@ hei@@ ls . it becomes clear that you have caught up here between the walls , which your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone have established . &quot;
&quot; they have been arrested me and my Father in three times , but this does not yet come , so that I am &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the Security Council - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he revealed his power over us by proof that he even destroyed the simpl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were bitten by peaceful protests such as weed from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it came out , so that the city sh@@ reds the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; ahu al@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; all the city districts , just my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ im@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not set high demands for a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; during the third night the things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply in the neighborhood had heard . &quot;
&quot; I am through the silence , while I cri@@ ed several times &quot; &quot; Allah Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; of my house @-@ ach . &quot;
I heard my voice of silence contradic@@ tory .
a few minutes later some of my friends were brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined to me ; we dedic@@ ate ourselves to a beautiful image that filled up my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you open the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the righteous . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot;
he placed on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can sw@@ allow yourself - nothing can give you your voice after you have lost all the way up to the office of the body service from the body .
I came there .
&quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I now too . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me listen to how you &quot; &quot; Allah Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry , if we are not in the vicinity . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ tive eyes turned out to me .
and you really mo@@ urn what to look in the eyes and not on the ground !
&quot; what I did , nothing has to do with courage . &quot;
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my tor@@ y@@ ness , van@@ ity ; perhaps on the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure to me , when I rep@@ lied , &quot; I would not think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I never stopped to see you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; is it in sol@@ it@@ ary , and his father equal to it . &quot;
&quot; his father equal to this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this distor@@ ted proposition is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture , which I was exposed to monthly . &quot;
I per@@ for@@ getting the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells . &quot;
I put all the details exactly before I super@@ vised the room .
otherwise it was likely to have a larger cell in this time .
I have to share it with only one more prisoners and allowed me immediately without waiting for their permission .
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I handle on an old @-@ known communication method : with the f@@ ist to beat the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned , that my cell @-@ stories was a &quot; &quot; awakening &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he answered me finally . &quot;
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a rep@@ utable man aged man who sees me similar and called &quot; &quot; doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , there can be no mark@@ ers to tell me , and doctors do not exist ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers are linked to its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the great cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had in@@ sured me , they would release him if I stay . &quot;
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu &quot; &quot; scre@@ am . &quot;
it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always around this time the scre@@ ams every day .
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of the verse , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( approximately : &quot; Donn@@ er &quot; , shooting on 13 S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to be li@@ stens to .
&quot; thus , the secret was founded : to protect the security of us to protect ourselves and to prevent terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fes@@ sions view and betra@@ yed the narrow fore @-@ field of its world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a cur@@ se that call it co@@ existence to turn the crimin@@ als of their mate into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I super@@ vise the audi@@ ences , and tre@@ ad to Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expres@@ sions that ent@@ ails him : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can close as much more important with your life as you &apos;ll close this day and to protest that anyway you will soon find an end . &quot;
I rep@@ lied .
&quot; I used to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to myself , not to answer . &quot;
I can really no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and stro@@ kes have become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication means .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to be pun@@ ished or forced to be pun@@ ished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
to punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; con@@ fes@@ sion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your hen has rejo@@ iced in your writing .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you can not measure you with him and you cannot hold your scri@@ be . &quot;
&quot; my cry made him not yet enough , so that she has been using the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; on my first det@@ ention I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked earlier as a gar@@ bage dump , or if it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables up to each other , to present ourselves from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within one hour three of them occurred three of them while I was still in the row .
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I heard up . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er once noted the cooling down and found no favor at all it is why it is as a neigh@@ bor to an electri@@ cally invited st@@ ab .
&quot; stream my whole body , enough to store my whole district . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ bare body , the out@@ stretched on the ground was the perfect power conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been at midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
a few hours left to me as a few minutes .
then the call to dawn .
&quot; the door opens up and the morning meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of a depl@@ eted young@@ sters : &quot; &quot; my lord , my father has to worry frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and away you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me away ? !
the former Rap@@ an Rap@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ bel about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ community to expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he so@@ oth@@ ed his canvas , time to his computer , and again also to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or with ni@@ cot@@ ine lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has been heard of them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had ended its occupation of the West Bank and had to escape from their village in Palestine , where she lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate majority , the conservative majority is faced and their old proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and Rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like ori@@ fic@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian conflict , but also demands the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues do not only take place in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance but also in cities that from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as a man who in his mind is not restricted by boundaries , and it can suffer according to the people who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not exist openly , he defeated a special incl@@ ination against the American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian &quot; escap@@ ed of the second generation too - so he says himself , even when he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think of my own life circumstances so , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think that because I am a man , while in water sol@@ dered Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the former Soviet law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ adan .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sing hot jun@@ k little with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of the warm coffee and the rech@@ arge of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you take a look in the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one simply avo@@ ids to do basic things - like being in public during the Ram@@ adan water - to not land in jail . &quot;
&quot; recently the interior of Jordan has said a performance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; a number of MPs , who support the Islamic Action Front in the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual fron@@ ts of Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , to contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former spokes@@ person of the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that said the concert &quot; &quot; precisely because of sexual orientation of the S@@ ang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; many believe in addition , the engagement of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world may be dangerous activ@@ ism which represents the old @-@ proven legitimacy of an author@@ itarian regime in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ ained people as &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; one who continued to decide for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is likely not easy to be sil@@ ently rh@@ et@@ oric but in fact a more evident reality in Jordan reflect , which is clearly reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in the year 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex @-@ men at Lei@@ be , when he formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex pre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently lower un@@ familiar woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women , who lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust . &quot;
over the past few years in Jordan the number of &apos; Ehr@@ en@@ mor@@ es &apos; has increased - the un@@ official outside .
&quot; human Rights Watch concluded that the number of hon@@ ors in 2016 reached their peak ; however , it is still start@@ ling that Jordan , the institutional infrastructure is lacking to support the women , the victims tried out of domestic or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women may be held in prison on in@@ definite period of time , and for their release is often a years of bureaucr@@ atic effort , and the guarantee by the family is necessary that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is known to go back to themes , which in its country is long as tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b argu@@ ed that his work is politically , spatial , however , that he is his music , the full explicit inv@@ itations to sexuality , freedom and expression is not able to separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I was challenged to politics , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; Gh@@ out@@ eb &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of the songs that are politically politically , can be further developed . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a way in which you can , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , heter@@ osexu@@ ality or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he notices that barely any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still severely c@@ ens@@ ored up to 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular J@@ ord@@ orian Onlin@@ e@@ Program Ro@@ ya , to later remember that his comments from the context were torn down , and his opinion has been c@@ ens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube , it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als do not un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ed the Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who has remained in memory still today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : when Abu Nu@@ what was supposed to work on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the eighth century openly writing about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom , there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are to be sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the former news service took several former government representatives and members of the teacher association , with the ration@@ ale , they would have expressed confidence on comments in social media , which coinci@@ ded with the deep in the land @-@ root corruption . &quot;
&quot; given the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs opinion , it is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has hon@@ ed a show for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it is of slow , bed@@ ding and inner changes . it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Syrian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , of an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreams of not just dre@@ amed of being his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region deals with music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , streams , and on artificial nature . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to operate , and therefore also to res@@ ist resistance . &quot;
this report was facilit@@ ated by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Repor@@ ting to which A@@ man heard as a student Fellow .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , ex@@ travag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; we suspected that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ bic . another theory as@@ sm@@ ashed across more than one thousand years , and dating from a period , to the indigenous people of the region , to comp@@ el the indigenous people of the region , into the knee . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to sn@@ ap a few great seats , so we have a superb view . &quot;
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted an two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I look forward to seeing the meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , take the Neb@@ uta Festival the only True - and to spend an amazing way in its summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fixed wag@@ ons was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help you to promote the Peru@@ vian youth from the crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us more important port , located on the coast of the Pacific ocean , located near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street consuming and illeg@@ i@@ hood of drugs . &quot;
&quot; in April 2017 , a survey revealed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population in this region could not feel secure . &quot;
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led that more and more norm@@ alities are moving into the experienced hands of hair@@ styles who can make these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles which go to the utmost limits of fantasy and creativity , has even an annual event inspired , the competition of the hair@@ your &quot; Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts to show each other , to show who you can see from them the most ex@@ cent@@ red lum@@ ber , as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions can be found on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; education institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who found themselves in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to find young people to find their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of obtaining a training in the hair@@ style of hair that allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the opportunities they offer do@@ zens of young people saw that they can take a profession at present in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in March and reported on some of their achievements :
in 1995 we were the only subject school in the community and the district which we are very proud of because from love to children we have built these educational community .

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the post &quot; love message on Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ler , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we just write love letter to people we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel amazed , affection attention ? &quot;
this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young @-@ Youth @-@ Foundation by the Young @-@ Youth @-@ Foundation ( letters for reconciliation ) to write young people to write Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ap@@ pers .
&quot; just recently , her country was in place of an historical event and they wanted to contribute to its part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ bi@@ ens ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international was considered to be the sub@@ ordination of the peace treaty , as significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received for his mer@@ its for the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; however , a long way before the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that have lived many years in illegal bearings , who were exposed to the war of war , and around the clock have tru@@ cking their weapons in their arms , must now be integrated into the life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear , and in some cases deep hat@@ red towards guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , it must now take into their ranks and support them when building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Kolum@@ bi@@ ans would have to close together and help with the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have been written letters - love amb@@ assador to former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare in order to welcome them back in society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare - which can then be transferred to personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for letters for reconciliation emerged on the world &apos;s summit of Nobel Peace Prize , which was held in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there they had Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we love the people whom we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s day thousands of love @-@ letter , but those forget that they need much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he told him further , this year his love with people to share the most urgent promise . &quot;
&quot; thus , the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and have to establish a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common story of peace . &quot;
so far the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters .
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colom@@ bian such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o region .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of J@@ aver@@ iana University of Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ al administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation to convey the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC did so on how they had done it earlier to take the prec@@ ep@@ ts of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters full of under@@ mining people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all participants . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different emotions you can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between is &quot; , &quot; told the political knowledge @-@ student Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience like this : &quot;
&quot; after we handed over the letters , a former fighters led me to the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a sort of cottage , where the guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , who wrote a little bit . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Dorn@@ ro@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; I spoke to him anyway and asked , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; I answered a letter that someone has written for me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life , someone has written something so beautiful , so I answered it . I suddenly ran the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him and set me next to the pom@@ eg@@ ers .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry , he was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighting , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life to war as war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to forgive him and his six brothers in front of hunger . &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society out there , which is waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round . &quot;
the students had all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
&quot; therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC made the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; many years now , we have experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this size , it is worthwhile to overcome all the obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela has been impressed :
&quot; to hear these people had never found hearing , and had no choice to know , and to realize that people that I have often seen as monsters and turned out even people with great feelings that were revers@@ ed by their lives and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does me sore . &quot;
but it com@@ for@@ ted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage to bring us something and give us a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
&quot; the Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ern was proph@@ es@@ y , that after the dis@@ ar@@ ming peace would reign . &quot;
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as inequality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to grasp the weapons to rise and to protest for their rights . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC have now put peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call on all the defen@@ ders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong to - about all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , do our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from our own experience , that nothing is simply . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual and que@@ er people , who live in the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
with fri@@ ght , activists have experienced the coverage of the past months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which depends like a D@@ amo@@ kl@@ ess value over the dor@@ f@@ ty LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only created overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q humor in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines after several months ago , after reports have been published , covering the wear , torture and killing que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspected que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she had noticed that she was in reality a woman . &quot;
&quot; when they were growing , it became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced by the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sabrina . &quot;
it is of fear for their lives later in the USA .
Sabrina : I was working as an hon@@ orary hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a acquain@@ tance from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ former that was put into trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , he made a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his ch@@ anting friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
afterwards the photos of my documents made the round of W@@ hat@@ s@@ App &apos;s lap .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was straight away , I heard a few clicks from the back of my car , I heard a male &apos;s voice : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I feel something in my body , but I did nothing wo@@ e . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a set , but this time at the Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you still want to honor the family , you swe@@ eping ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that there was a young man , not thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ woke the end in the hospital again .
apparently some women had gotten everything and started to cry .
the man was flo@@ wn .
the women had called an ambulance .
in the hospital I experienced that I had two key@@ hole in my right lung .
OC Media : in what medical wings were you put on - in the men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on ; but the doctor stood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it with fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ er , a k@@ au@@ kas@@ y name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some totally un@@ familiar . &quot;
that was the beginning of a alp@@ sad .
my family was attended by neighbors and some distant relatives .
the slo@@ w@@ down to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
&quot; they presented absurd calls : some told me , I have to prove it by going up without the roads lead ; others wanted that I had not changed my generation in Gros@@ ny , and I say that I was not changed my sex , that everything was just Schl@@ ech@@ tre@@ de , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have bas@@ king size C - what could I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family tries to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older men talked to my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only your family , but the whole of the republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot stop you , because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay down a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later I stood under the window a car with remote window wash@@ ers and a numer@@ ical plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
&quot; after the third time it was happened , I realized that there was somewhat lazy . &quot;
my human rights @-@ friends det@@ ox@@ i@@ fy the numbers of numbers - it turned out that I have been persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you flo@@ wn ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to know their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it , without being able to register without hes@@ itation , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SI@@ M card and cast them into the tr@@ ash .
came to and chec@@ s into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment when I call my mother to call on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you black@@ est in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , to what hotel you do . you even know your room number . &quot;
just to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and sisters .
&quot; however , we are not talking about the gender equality , however , this is a table theme . &quot;
some traditional k@@ au@@ kas@@ y elements I still carry in me .
&quot; so much I wish to overcome this se@@ el@@ ic barrier , I cannot overcome . &quot;
&quot; I say always that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we ch@@ atting with camera , I actually give me trouble to see how the person arises from their past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sabrina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the necessary information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; I talked with someone , the one and a half months left in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ adan , there were no human being arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t closed a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; with that , I mean , they probably load the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; through blood recovery has experienced . &quot;
OC Media : are there still a gay men in these secrets ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says there were just not very many .
&quot; if , especially those who have no rich relatives or have been left by their relatives to put a ca@@ vern in Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there so that one can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be converted , they will show their body on TV and claim they could have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not just gone , but targeted to radi@@ cal@@ ze . &quot;
OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation or have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I have just im@@ pris@@ oned someone who was in@@ im@@ pris@@ oned one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people were gone to this prison after their beard grew .
there have since been nothing new of them .
you simply took it away .
&quot; and so called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; but until now , they were not presented as a band@@ its , but there have been no reports so far . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would it not have been allowed to shave this man to shave ?
&quot; know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , &quot; already occurred in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 I was already familiar to Gros@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had problems . &quot;
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , then it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia was originally wanted to lead us to the &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately he was thrown back into the St@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria Law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had t@@ ing@@ ed eyelashes , carried out Rö@@ hr@@ je@@ ans and a short T@@ ops . &quot;
the security of the sh@@ aria has never war@@ ned me only a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and all the city knew ; they knew why men , young people , there met . &quot;
we have never been instruc@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ otte not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
&quot; it is often said to children , if that make yourself fun over sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they have never sinn@@ ed , never h@@ unted and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace be held ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed to the prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us , but mainly on the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel like the people in the city started to change . &quot;
&quot; who had suffered before and laugh@@ ed , considered you at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the Republic is constantly wast@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
&quot; besides , I am still working as a activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ ups , meetings , I accompany it to hospital and help them to get eating cards . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for this .
I discovered these people myself when I picked up a sanctuary .
&quot; I am Muslims , and wants to help those who need help . &quot;
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ bern .
&quot; so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; that is exactly the same as those who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no bo@@ b@@ umps with them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which , the Kab@@ ard@@ iner have which , the Russians also have which ; on the entire planet there are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I am from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear . &quot;
here are so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ram@@ adan pro - live with men together .
&quot; do you know , many think about transi@@ tional identity to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his generation to make more intimate experiences . but this is a trust@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; these are two different kinds - two different types of sensation to be exactly , different lifesty@@ les . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not as@@ ham@@ ed for my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I will personally be here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n of an increase of self @-@ murder in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian activists region is suffering an un@@ usually high employment and poverty @-@ rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there is a strong increase in self @-@ murder . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in A@@ wa@@ z .

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the dubi@@ ous situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ elight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the South@@ west of Iran .
&quot; he escap@@ ed under anxiety and depression , and he insi@@ sted for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness that may arise for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; one on the YouTube shared video held the moments , after being sho@@ cked himself . &quot;
&quot; some people quickly made it quickly to clear the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the comb@@ us@@ tion were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ ic@@ ide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists from the place war@@ n that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month , some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : there were all family members who felt thanks to persecution on the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable , to feed their families and follow a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
&quot; the region , in which a large proportion of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community is located , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult to argue for the native Arab population . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an predominantly aut@@ on@@ ome region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy took over the power and end up to 1925 big efforts to finish the ethnic autonomy in Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran &apos;s oil and gas fields , as well as some of the richest and most valuable markets for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population gets only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime has denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arabs , systematically jobs in the local oil , gas , and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of farms , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are around . &quot;
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi young people now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ OUR Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Direc@@ torate for Ko@@ operative , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who finished a job , completed 55 % of the leading school and 45 % of the university &apos;s degree . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian mor@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; the number of self @-@ murder among young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse and worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of pedi@@ atri@@ cians in the coming ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setup process :
&quot; as officials and institutions prefer not to set up Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will give access to employers opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and to force them to earn their living outside of their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their suburbs and names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi , and so be questioned , since even Arab names should not be toler@@ ated , because the Spe@@ ak of the Arabic language or the pl@@ agues arab@@ ic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances , who have to end@@ ure the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi , propose human rights activists , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is elaborate and take note of it .
the main reason for su@@ ic@@ ide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ ic@@ ide is avoidable .

why I do not identify with femin@@ ism as well as inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alen
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
&quot; the following article is an over@@ worked version of the opinion which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide , and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . this article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al femin@@ ists - with Fr@@ ust . &quot;
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally have all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for instance , women nowadays are still less money in spite of the same education than men . &quot;
that women are still under str@@ ingent observation when it comes to what they can do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later occur in various areas of life to a smooth blank@@ et , and that discrimination based on sex is still across the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all this is aware of me and well @-@ known .
I am convinced of this and I am twice and triple them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , if I talk to skin colour , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ T women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q church , or on black women from the Dias@@ pora , when I mention , on which kind we have been physically , se@@ el@@ ic and verbal abuse , decide to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , all agree that women - all women - should come together to sing &quot; their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya &apos; to sing my Lord &apos; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about it , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence a institution@@ alized form of racial violence , which we are exposed to two black women . &quot;
&quot; or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities , and of origin @-@ places earn less than white men and women . &quot;
that black girls and girls are referred to in school with a migration background as a white girl because of obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand I want all women , all men and at all persons each have no skin colour , but on the other hand , I can consider myself as a black woman to take into account the white woman who refuse to take into account both the gender and the skin colour of a person . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist oriented sphere , which repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women and again . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner said in 18@@ 51 in her speech , &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in historic respects is a human and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to connect me group@@ ings , who also absor@@ b our customs and customs , in order to drive their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to put white women the importance of over@@ cutting skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to remain the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to vet them for a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al Femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different homes and to limit themselves from white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I urge it to release me full of femin@@ ism , bringing me to the movement of wak@@ anism , which is called for my dark@@ ened skin and my status as a woman , which is so stub@@ born as a novel phenomenon is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and set us into the spheres , which will be created for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ ens : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , in which they are able to defend ourselves completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered : &quot;
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines - to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement from which the black woman is affected .
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can raise black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradi@@ gm I exist . &quot;
I am recognized because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman as a part of this paradi@@ gm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life was neither over@@ looked , nor ignored . &quot;
&quot; p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man , the rivers in Iraq for future generations &quot;
&quot; this contribution of To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular on international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; in connection with a Content @-@ Shar@@ ing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a particular concern through Kur@@ dist@@ an in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers and impact of pollution to its church . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a kid , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country are concerned that the decades of war , the construction of artificial men , the pollution and the un@@ controll@@ able development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - an affiliate of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which uses itself to protect rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a gives Mus@@ a the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced and edited . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on the following , little considerable sub@@ cultures and stands out by the use of co@@ oper@@ ative vide@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with whose help oppressed communities , their stories to tell their way . &quot;
Paraguay women and their difficult struggle against violence
a group of women &quot; represents &quot; the wept women &quot; to express their ache over the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show their rejection .

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; the article belongs to the number # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # devi@@ ating ) , which reports on the tissues against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the people concerned .
&quot; a police kom@@ miss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they have nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex partners who has become violent towards violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship was some time passed , and the police said , her statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed due to abuse , also the acoustic indicator of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman went back their display .
breaking the devil @-@ circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women are under any indication , they do not generally receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also dependent on men dependent on men who are mis@@ diagnosed . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence to admit themselves at all at the prosec@@ ution authorities . &quot;
&quot; inhal@@ ing and Statisti@@ ken@@ 2 Un@@ visible ab@@ uses and a legal system that does not sub@@ ni@@ mm@@ 3 Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , lack of implementation and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women really mis@@ led , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researchers for Gen@@ der@@ ask at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are various references and reports that do not even prevent the scale of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these figures are alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , at the District Office of 9@@ 600 indicators went to domestic violence because of domestic violence . by 70 % of it , it was a matter of violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police arrived by women .
&quot; there were over 5000 indicators because of domestic violence in the peace of peace . here , 86 % of the indicators came from women . &quot;
&quot; in the ads told 40 % of women that they were physically mis@@ led , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics reveal not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to information from the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Inter @-@ Minister of Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; &quot; on every woman who are refundable in Paraguay for psych@@ ic abuse , 9 females that do not do this . &quot;
&quot; every woman , which is disp@@ at@@ re@@ funded because of physical abuse , come two women who do not do this , &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as women &apos;s su@@ ic@@ ide is no own criminal off@@ ences , the criminal enforcement agencies cannot be properly documented , as many women were murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 journalists at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ ic@@ ide in the country . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates in Paraguay , every ten days a woman died due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible abuse and a legal system that doesn &apos;t matter anything
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z the firm friend of Carlos Vera was , he insi@@ sted that she called his name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning it was not meant to do that , but then left . however , this should be rep@@ ented for ever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer coinci@@ ded with Carlos - one of the most common forms of violence against women , while at the same time , the most severe forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable : &quot;
I had never thought that I would become a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read earlier about it , I always thought that that only women happens to be sub@@ mis@@ sive because they dec@@ eive by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen that .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name to name , she wrote posts on Facebook in which they described its insul@@ ts and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen for such a long time by Carlos and he did not leave him before . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain compli@@ city to it . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner she has mis@@ led . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women all in any way victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with mental abuse .
&quot; their wealthy partner finally made it even to persu@@ ade them , that it was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he started to beat her .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as indicators in the authorities remained without result and also by their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a process against its former partners who developed into an im@@ penet@@ r@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach to lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not being applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , provides great problems with the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Für@@ th ) . &quot;
this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ income ) are part of a campaign on Twitter who is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
&quot; the original design of the law faces , to explain the fem@@ ini@@ d to an independent criminal off@@ ense and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; the leg@@ is@@ ext has changed in some points to also win members of the law , who feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tion , that is currently forbidden in Paraguay and will be pun@@ ished with up to five years . &quot;
&quot; the original law was intended to provide the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , who do not need to carry out the victims of violence by itself if they just want to refund and provide a safe place to stay the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure does not provide adequate financial resources to make it available : &quot;
in Paraguay abuse is seen as part of inter@@ human relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ think will take place so that violence is no longer regarded as anything normal . &quot;
&quot; those who have seen in view of these facts is guilty , and carries out that the perpetrators will be shed free . &quot;
we have to refund as long as possible and no longer applies to abuse .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . before , parts of the law had been altered . among other things , some passage of the law was crossed by the partners in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor , to once again attack his victim . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ ing@@ ing of words &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man launched a year after b@@ anning a newspaper furthermore attacks
&quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Information Department of Information &quot; is on the homepage of the inter@@ connected newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
&quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues in prison , where he was in prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried before judgment , later came again freely . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been governed by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state @-@ rich . &quot;
&quot; since then , he dressed , in addition to his role as a single sult@@ an , the most important minist@@ ries in the country : Prime Minister , Minister Minister , Minister Minister , Minister Minister , Minister of Foreign Affairs , President of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the central bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the sult@@ an is characterised by the per@@ sever@@ ing efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic secrets , public freedoms , including press freedom , nor to limit human rights , blo@@ ggers and further activists , in@@ timi@@ d and det@@ ecting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities limiting peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights have been systematically and hin@@ dering citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country like corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closure and the det@@ ention of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since its founding in 2007 was reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , the chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , which was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . it was about corruption in the judiciary , and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused , judge of the Supreme Court to be put under pressure to lift up a judgment in an inheritance . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 , with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; high @-@ level parties involving hands of justice . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , he was arrested by Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Edit@@ h Committee , transferred from the ISS prior to the special department and was arrested in his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS announced the dep@@ uty chief editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acts according to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is Fest@@ ing as chief editor . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed down at a certain time after the information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first hear@@ ings in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists by pris@@ ons and also ord@@ ained the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned with the dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the State . &quot; &quot;
&quot; moreover , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty to the violation of a audience , and found guilty . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison and pen@@ alties in the amount of each 3000 year @-@ old Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition a one @-@ year career offered against the two journalists was promised .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to one year prison and a fine @-@ sentence of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollar ) after making use of a information network for the dissem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order .
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a b@@ ail was fixed in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of custo@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court spoke for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 free , condemned al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i to six months of prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after the completion of his six@@ teen prison sentence in Mas@@ kat died in prison where he rel@@ ies his one @-@ year prison .
the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court also highlighted the Order of the Ministry of Ministry to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the paper looks still exposed to attacks by the om@@ anian government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the information Minister granted a directive with which the closing of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information Minister personally signed a further directive in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the ministers introduced a further time against the decision of the appeal of appe@@ als to the publication of the paper . &quot;
&quot; the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases , in which in O@@ man was in@@ ju@@ red the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; for example , to further violations include the closure of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to adjust its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare the extensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) demands the om@@ anic authorities on : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and uncondi@@ tionally available ;
to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists will be able to carry out their work ;
to protect the press freedom in the country
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights defense and journalists in O@@ man will be di@@ so@@ sted to their ri@@ ghtful human rights work , and without fear of measures , including judicial sl@@ ings . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia , figure is done with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not mentioned at all . this is an increasing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need for medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack in the offer of global healthcare being many drugs and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria did in the poorest countries of Africa far more serious effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases by the pharmaceutical firms are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is conducted by African scientists itself , in building its own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the Centre for investigation of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia on , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he studied the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to assist the sam@@ b@@ arian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ or discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media about these research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work is on application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ arian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with lab testing .
&quot; in addition , I &apos;ve just got a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic testing for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think is the important current knowledge themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there is no basic research here . we only bet solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always be recipient , instead of being creators . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well used in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects ?
R@@ W : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or do here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what barriers are there in your routine research work you had not had before ?
&quot; R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; R@@ W : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation . &quot;
&quot; G@@ V : how large is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they concentrate and how can we support development ? &quot;
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there are need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , Computer Science , Big Data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; R@@ W : often there are the limited speed , things to do , and the scar@@ ed access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines can only be made available to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
&quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed producers will change global food production &quot;
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com site , a magazine that reports about sol@@ v@@ ents for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton trained in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company has 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ded , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astr@@ on@@ aut in space . &quot;
&quot; almost 20 years Mor@@ ton &apos;s work has been removed only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity , and the question how many sal@@ v@@ ans can get limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use it further . &quot;
&quot; patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green leaf or curved sheets . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years more , more such patents have been log@@ ged in more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ on varieties . due to these trends , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alist and atomic energy security concerns the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as an im@@ passion@@ ed representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mor@@ ton is still salad , but since its work is more and more and more and more limitations . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if in a river there is a rock @-@ bro@@ ck , around which I have to f@@ aint . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed any more of a new sal@@ uted , because all the features already patented . he makes it as good as possible and attempts to breed those features that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and tried to use no material , which is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he also joined a movement that is ever increasing in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; breeding ) . &quot;
&quot; astronom@@ er of the International Space station ISS have red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ded in the &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atory &quot; &quot; of the station and eaten . there it will be tested , whether plants can be grown in space . &quot;
photo : NASA
&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area , and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
&quot; it was called to life to ensure that some plants and gens are not protected as intellectual property , and so for plant bree@@ ders are permanent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the initiative , shortly Os@@ si , U.S. bree@@ ders can also undertake that others can use the seed of them bred seed . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed , and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder only allow others to breed their seed , to breed so its own varieties , and it is not immediately utter@@ ing - two aspects which are forbidden by many plant stations . &quot;
do@@ zens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the em@@ powered Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Os@@ si @-@ Vor@@ anc@@ ellor Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed , and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed plays an important role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to breed the latter not or only little by raising seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not employed with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants might be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; &quot; who &apos;s good , locally and sustainable produced vegetables , such as such as farmers are offered , should also know that the way of how this vegetables is bred . &quot;
nutritional sovereign without seed @-@ sou@@ si@@ veness is not possible .
&quot; the members of the open source Se@@ ed initiative are committed to providing others to its seed , and thus to pat@@ rol their action in contrast , seed , and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supplies is endangered , since the available recovery is due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always limited , un@@ matched . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her doc@@ toral work with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ el characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it available for plant bree@@ ders either at all or only scar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are still no such estimates , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspected that mass @-@ made plants are patented in even larger style as salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a Question of View
&quot; plants become so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments , and threats like p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
opponents of pat@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decre@@ asing for more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently un@@ law@@ ful than ever before , since changing conditions due to climate change are much worse predic@@ table . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaker Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to , that genetic variety are generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ res and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of United States , the company is setting up for the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; it contradi@@ cts the view that intellectual property restri@@ cts other bree@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ties innovations . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that each can follow as soon as the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result .
&quot; thus , such protection inhi@@ bit innovations not , but promotes it to be provided by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees the different : 20 years to wait for a patent of patent , and certainly no innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you are waiting for a long time waiting for plants to breed , which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , could have lost the battle . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is however , that genetic resources have always been a general and still should remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want to make farmers easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be made impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton cl@@ ue to the concept itself to pat@@ rol the plant and we do not really create the characteristics itself . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eder , we finally have no idea how plants do it . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ ders in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si pre @-@ member state , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; who bred a sor@@ ting , he also bred his own values into it . &quot;
&quot; who believes on industrial agriculture with great cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ al believes in cultivation of mass@@ aging Her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de , who are bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is accurate . &quot;
&quot; while some medium sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents possess , it creates the most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either reject them or hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ ders Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his breeding garden sal@@ ads .

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the prevention of plant @-@ patented innovative would : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that pat@@ rol . &quot;
&quot; I need a lot of new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors are going to sell my sorts within a few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is 20 years ahead of competition , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot;
&quot; while the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept is fast approaching and fast all over the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed program , working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding is different from country to country , whose Os@@ si obligation cannot be simply established one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able , and thus it speaks against the current practice of the European patent stands , which permits patents on conventional plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation still is not a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of plant bree@@ ders and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , that the organization is currently taking a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official start signal . &quot;
&quot; a merger from environmental protection and development aid groups ( including hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group to ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity globally to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - an association and aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report released , it represents that farmers must have the opportunity to improve seeds and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; in the report also the importance of a mani@@ fold , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems stresses - a connection between the Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes that there will soon be more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to di@@ z@@ ze man , that is even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
&quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on the weekend around the 05.@@ August the Egyptian government had documented the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August published the network an opinion on Facebook , in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and spoke to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information consistent , despite this attack and the mo@@ ck of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities what the law was supposed to defend in this part of the world , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I have never been so difficult to overcome these targets , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the closure and do not add . we insist on to fulfill our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first c@@ ann@@ ated website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities approved for more than two months of 21 web pages such as b@@ sp@@ . the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar &apos;s network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era &quot; because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the Colom@@ bian and human rights research scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of column and articles , which he is not known for Egypt , non @-@ accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set , to deal with the chief apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider in which also the Zi@@ adas blog is located , on the other hand is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video , such as the police of physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; however , to bul@@ lock blogs is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of a reward ; A arrest , a tried murder , pre @-@ operation at the national Security Council , the closure blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
2 ) You proved that I wrote not in vain . in other words : my words have influence if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
&quot; first I used it to the post of articles , to get the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to an end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ row and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities of 24 May to 06@@ th of August 133 websites . this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented the block of vendors , by changing intern@@ et@@ or@@ ship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( VP@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 of June we noticed how the blocking of websites , the VP@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block and block content and fil@@ tering to the Egyptian users .
&quot; in addition , the situation will additionally be wast@@ ed that the decision @-@ making should be made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis , using it before judgment against these actions . &quot;
now the question is : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack it next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day spent day newspapers in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; Every@@ one second day is murdered by a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves smo@@ ked pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends , 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Lu@@ oc@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the greenhouse gas in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian organisation Global Justice set out even the United Nations to access .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least the manager of a local paper .
&quot; the results published for detailed reporting of violence in Rio &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; on 16 August the editorial article &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sexual ver@@ ings , etc . all , however , what happens from the civil@@ ised standard and what only happens in Rio in the &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to information of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 territories , which are controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
in the editorial section the newspaper writes :
&quot; we are aware that a war course is dis@@ rup@@ ting , if it is distor@@ ted , atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions to dec@@ eive . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
did the name &quot; war &quot; more than they use ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil argu@@ ed the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it ag@@ eing to hold responsibilities in the police .
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and worse planning , such as extra in the analysis of military income in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in staff , education and a historical and self @-@ pleas@@ ing negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital . &quot;

&quot; on these security policy measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal Republic of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a massive police officers and a unity permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to an acceptance of violent deaths . for some years now , the U@@ PP has resulted in numerous reports and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under attack . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not defined - by the Geneva Convention set - criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war has also serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; because this calls for the state to use funds and ways that are typical for a war . this includes the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and is used for the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war hin or her , FA@@ KT is that the inhabitants of Fav@@ elas suffer from Rio . &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Sy@@ rer to plant mushrooms
screenshot of the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal attacks and block@@ ades , mainly by Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation P@@ ax and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of loading . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly strongly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons held on 21 August 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the mass@@ acre was carried out by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre was carried out by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels have controlled controlled areas outside Damascus led under si@@ ege , which led to local residents to be influenced by tun@@ nels or through tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
through the years of block@@ ade traditional foods such as meat become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
&quot; as a counter @-@ level , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of the Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional ones in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . their dietary strength makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided for cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years that this project has been fighting , and op@@ ted his relief that it is now more and more &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge to the plant@@ ation of mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to gather to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 . September 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; due to fuel scar@@ ce , locally produced fuel made from plastic materials used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said , Global Vo@@ ices , that they started with the &quot; production &quot; from the regions of the region , before they over@@ check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . when this managed , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have been distributed to fung@@ i everywhere in the Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people the pilgrims from different reasons &quot; &quot; : break the si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ suff@@ iciency , by me@@ al@@ remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee table , cardboard , etc ) to be used to produce new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities which are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and Bel@@ ag@@ ation is visible . &quot;
we want our experience to be inspired in crisis areas and we can help mankind .

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that lived in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were in@@ ju@@ red by the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state ur@@ ning .
fires were also registered in the G@@ ali@@ zi@@ en region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it appreci@@ ates that there were more than 500 fire@@ qu@@ arri@@ es that spreads to the north and centrally located regions of the country , around 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande had a similar tragedy , where it existed for 64 deaths and over 200 wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European For@@ st@@ surveillance system , which super@@ vised the forest area per satellite recordings , are alone 2017 in Portugal about 50@@ 0.000 hectares of forest , an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prev@@ entative care and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection was not able to squee@@ ze the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al by the federal government of the farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
after Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were evac@@ u@@ ated for everything and nothing .
&quot; this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are stupid reports of open streets , which were enclosed by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria would have had a similar tragedy , as in June again , because the streets were locked very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction approved in eco @-@ places are inter@@ viewed with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the whale shar@@ per , which had brought the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was accused of the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led a l@@ ati@@ le of the law referred to as the applicant writes about means to self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything was built , João Sor@@ val takes on the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made attention to that large areas with Eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees from easily inflamm@@ able wood , as in a famine circle , according to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; to these problems comes that the website of the civil defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when the inhabitants were examined or tried to contact , to contact offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative , which provided the population with information : they used the own civil data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched by the developers of João P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so decisive on this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the server disp@@ uted by the acquisition of 400,000 users , which did not with@@ stand this site more than half a million access . &quot;

&quot; at night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
two years ago a terrible civil war had been defeated between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan was to become a country of terror and desp@@ air .
&quot; right at this time A@@ ari@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afgh@@ an istan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother didn &apos;t say it back then , she didn &apos;t know that she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the dawn the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the be@@ aters .

&quot; Abdu@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara domin@@ ate the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat was murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly vulnerable . &quot;
the Taliban on the Haz@@ ara known Taliban always came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ k found themselves to Pakistan . &quot;
he worked for a couple of years he worked in a co@@ ver@@ pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left from his minor reward , and went in Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow , the he@@ avier than he himself , to make himself living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the lives of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; remembered as@@ shar@@ ks in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we lived in an empty house on the construction site , where we worked on . &quot;
&quot; there were no services there and no heating . we handed n@@ ylon front of the open windows , so that we can not fres@@ her at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , he left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered vi@@ val and str@@ and@@ ed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ ks in 2002 came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time had been homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that shared twice a day food in relief . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high loading quot@@ as is a sort of second chance for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers in the country will find cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres . &quot; &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to an recep@@ tive centre , if it officially launched a request for asylum - which can be returned after the registration of the asylum seeker . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for an accommodation to depend on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it is also as@@ shar@@ ks .
&quot; but his unbeliev@@ ably livel@@ i@@ ons helped to liber@@ ate A@@ shar@@ af , soon out of these conditions . &quot;
&quot; after he had taken several years of work in the building , he tasted its total savings into the creation of a youth hostels in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a Schn@@ elli@@ mb@@ iss .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story is now theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( English : &quot; &quot; behind vene@@ tian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
&quot; the film was awarded the Venice City Award , which was awarded in 2017 for the first time . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries .
&quot; over the last few years some of the Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including cutting groups , travel agents , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iters and the chefs largely refugees from different parts of the world .
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes made the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; but A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals are far beyond the Italian dining room and retailers and aim to go back to the country , which he had to leave for as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ ks with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my country and I cannot live happy if I know that my people suff@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of the society and have to get the same options as everyone else .
&quot; they also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and con@@ serving techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their seri@@ ousness in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey .

&quot; the Egyptian parliament checks a draft law , which sees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registration with a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users would have to use to use social networks within six months after the proposed legislation on the website of the authority , indicating their full name as well as their assignment . &quot;
who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months in prison or det@@ ention of a pen@@ di@@ ment .
&quot; the law , which was applied by the sixth parliamentary members , is currently being deb@@ ated with the legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament and will be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; May , another member of parliament decided to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the har@@ ass@@ ment of the president or of a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the har@@ ass@@ ination of the President as well as government institutions are already pun@@ is@@ hable . under the law proposal , such an act would act with pris@@ ons and Coun@@ ts , as legal experts in Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be adopted , this can be divided up to three years imprisonment for pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators , who fought against the military coup in favour of the elected President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited for more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested in det@@ ention with the same incident , four years in jail . &quot;
&quot; recently his trial was postp@@ oned on 20 May , because the prison guide according to human rights groups had failed to put the accused of prison in the court of court . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ load of other weapons , illeg@@ i@@ timate meeting , murder and tried murder . &quot;
in another case he spoke a criminal court in G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage on the Pro @-@ Mor@@ si Seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdu@@ ll@@ ah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist to sc@@ anned documents
&quot; May the Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the trial of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been mainly h@@ it@@ ated by the President of the Republic ; the according to the plan was explicitly supported by the President of the Republic and according to the General regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused of Am@@ nest@@ y if these are all un@@ ri@@ ght@@ fully preser@@ ves .
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , thro@@ ws a light on how the pre@@ di@@ cal plans to support the legislative situation look . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia re@@ jects the disclosure of his sources at the disclosure of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 . May as a witness in the case .
will China force the users of social media to submit their credit points ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the Office of the People &apos;s Republic of People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China to write or share messages into social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration with the full recur@@ ring name is required . &quot;
an@@ al@@ ysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments must be achieved within social networks . it is now unclear how the authorities use these regulations .
Chinese networks have proposed resolutions in social media to selective these provisions only selective in order to protect the journ@@ alism and its independence .

&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or missed We@@ Chat , to sign up in the provincial government as the &quot; organizer of the information broad@@ casts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government introduces a list of online services , which also allows the &quot; publication of the information &quot; to be responsible for the removal of content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently on web sites such as v@@ no@@ o@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2,@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and du@@ sting of other services . &quot;

&quot; an Turkish court ordered the block@@ age Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administr@@ ators refuse to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey support the jiha@@ dists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication have been closed , because they work on &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to incorporate a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey is completely blocked . it is , in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can not stop coming back @-@ up
&quot; following this week the Government of Britain is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased monitoring projects , the internet service providers would force to monitor communications in real time and to install back@@ door programs that de@@ code the data coded . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services related to the proposal , however , has other technological companies and the civilian population . &quot;
&quot; despite all , the consultation will still be forwar@@ ded to the 19th of May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be passed on to the ministry . &quot;
