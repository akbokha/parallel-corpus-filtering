<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, I have been playing American music, American authors and operated his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me, that I mainly became a journalist for American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, which covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stued the murderous conspiracy of a oil-magnates who had his interest scouraged."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only been reinforced."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety are so inviting you're always who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very dirty letter of love about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as it goes with its bottlenders."</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague expressed it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted for him in Scharen."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won by the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number that has ever reached a candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support these biggie person, asked me?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters into harmony with the people that I met in Phoenix during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the Journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deep breath person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also the Trumps worldview not with the author of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met us in our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix "in the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance stands also in contrast to generosity that I lived with Sandy Bahr, who fight for their lives for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is still adapting to the commitment of Kristi Cappes, which always helped me to get used with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those caused by them embodied my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump goes its way to the appointed Republican presidential data, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of his restricted vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the argument with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they have either shared its racism and fanaticism or because they were ready to overlook these things, and broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump electorate as a rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, one of my friends, is exactly what has led to us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates a inability to understand those who act and think in another way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which most of them are, for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented the cruel decision to descend a man who look down with contempt upon those who look differently from it."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" "(m.).: much as" "elongation of the White against all other Ethnics"; "wording from white in anthrows on the White and whiplash, which means as much as Schleudertrauma), as it was the great Van Jones, who has done exactly what America did so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you like, America is always welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose his president, twice the son of a Kenyman whose history, as he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with the election Donald Trumps there is a huge part of the white America of this promise, saying:" "hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>

<seg id="56">"could someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and lucrack "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "God is thanks to Mr. Trump, that is not your America." "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps country, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America.</seg>

<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, La Banda de Música has now been playing in the municipality: one of children and adults of existing Symphony Orchestra, which has found a way to overcome them surrounding them."</seg>
<seg id="74">A Musikschule with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their drugs abuse and the gangs violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after an accidental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth so a rare hopeless hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously and the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi:</seg>
<seg id="79">"once they come from school, they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to follow her big passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bustling you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are playing the children of Cateura - a village which is practically at the biggest trash of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments, which are made of recurring waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with re-prepared instruments that consist of local fixed waste materials, made in a workshop for music instruments in Cateura where the Recycler under the direction of Favio Chavez have begun to transform parts of the waste in instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imided violins, violas, Celli, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, trumpets, trumpet, trombones and percussion, which were all produced from the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayish and Latin American music as well as music of The Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez is reminiscent of the local economologist and Musicians' children of Cateura, to the initial time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach in the same place the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something has been shown what he had never seen before: a made of waste-made violin.</seg>

<seg id="100">"in West Africa, then it was known that this ship had already engaged in liberianian waters of illegal fishing fishing, before it looked the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East-African countries were raised with this and little saddened to welcome the legislative brewer of this kind on their shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised quickly against the ship. they lingered him, one of their ports, and refuse to share it for a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursuddenly was the Premier surrounded by countries that you simply lingered "," recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leading engineer of the Kenyan fisheries authorities. he is part of a team that was discovered and followed the ship. "</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch him out there fish."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately it was compelled to pay 2 million US dollars to liberia, because of looting the fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which controls criminal practices and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries which at that time had expelled the Premier from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. you exchange information and stand out of each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "" says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers fISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is by definition unregulated: what is trapped, is hidden, because of it is extremely difficult to absorb. thus, the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by intentional abuse of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing and ecosystems will hurt those of a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however, while actions against illegal fishing were once driven by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail empiouo, with the information between individual countries, so the actions are in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can communicate with each other for example lists existing licenses, news on suspicient activities or details that have noticed or experienced during a port."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships which fish in the botle areas. also let themselves be suspiciable driving around, such that a ship invites his caught fish on other ships while on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the ideal case, such surveys may show whether the ships involved have a fishing licence, where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal register."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what means that the ships will not sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to numbers of penalties, such as in the case of the Premier."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then a significant financial loss for the owner, which means that the illegal fishing caters is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the platform mentioned above was created to gain a estimated 20 million USD an abandoned turnover, losing its eight members of the HISH-i each year because of illegal fishermen that penetrate into ostAfrican waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna-fish accessories because of the region of commercial fishing from around the world. among these even those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"to their practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag, fake liclicers, indication of phantasizing, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they specifically use the lack of international cooperation and make sure that weaknesses of a non-seamlessly organised control system", "says Long." "earlier a ship could not stop illegally and a country could not say" You do not daring my harbour. "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Comm to me'. 'and exactly this legale Schlupch tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH-i participated in more than 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has exposed criminal networks, the fake licenses were distributed in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has been abandoned and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the International Authority on combating crimes, FISH-i information on illegal fishing can divide and preserved across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our studies take us quite far into the networks organised crime", "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system, which should help the ISH-i, suspected ships of precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite staff, which is always being developed, also helps to escalate illegal ships who like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO focusing also with fishing data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships also turn off their automatic identification systems, which means that they cannot afford more of satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps build a system linking different information levels together. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team can actually influence African nations undoubtedly at the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, Skyeana has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch - a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed on the worldwide position of every single traceable ship."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together, together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - that results simply meaning," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to combine themselves and to bundle their resources."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run, in which a global system implements the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals but they also detailled.</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships used earlier without licence, and hardly had to reckon with consequences, they know that they will be observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating at FISH-i countries participating in the meantime a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats can buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1 applied, the inspections found there on board slew, whose use is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries to us," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined together with so-called West Africa Task Force. also they are fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as the ISH." "With safety, the aim of creating more such initiatives and structures can also be created in other regions." "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia could report his first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag on the road. and not only was the ship used without a license and have been used tow, which are now banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated yet in the ban waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the Take-measure against Greko 1 set the a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"at ISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative working method works to protect the oceans actually throughout the world.

<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced, as the draft should not be informed because Egyptian authorities should not register the registration as Egyptian authorities are unable to register by the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>

<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Hill Storytelling (TLS) is the recount of stories in their original language a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported recently over another initiative of Steven Bird, the intranslatable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not being written on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States where TLS already has undertaken events, the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not be passed on to the children."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project is:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass die of the languages of the world can be avoided if we manage cities, accept diversity, secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are, around dah."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"when they are often related to understanding," to understand these events instead 'the listening to cherish to feel. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers put their story first in their own language and translate them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, they conduct their devotion and their representation that the audiences are encouraged."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laugh and emotions that the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"for example, the following video shows for example a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the storyteller Rassidatou is also the opportunity to explain for their country typical customs of narration."</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fork of the rabbits and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"having explained the meaning of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked," How is that to an audience, that your language does not understand? "with a wide ditches he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were very happy with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have occurred in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this. all those inspired by the project may contact TLS to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge, and which are the real costs with which this is connected."</seg>

<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title of collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that wants to push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, namely immediately."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us begin to let us think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">Why have we decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extremities?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper for Open Source and digital activist has been in prison syrischer government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown place."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and Ombudsperson Noura Ghazi reported that the" military police is based on the basis of a "strictly secret" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>

<seg id="1204">His place of stay and condition remain unknown but still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, bass played a crucial role to expand access to the internet and knowledge to the general public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and at the moment of the leader of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassels cultural protesters was presient than the work, which he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites of the world, was the Waykreuz numerous civilizations, and here merging Greek-Roman architecture of architecture with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would put it all, this architecture that not only embodied the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strip into the digital archeology and the conservation has created a time-capsule, which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not yet complete this project before. "</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I have spent my whole life with it, of freedom to dream and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call its name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read English well, to write and speak."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he always has his knowledge with each being shared, who has asked. he has taught other detention to read English and speak."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened me the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also contributed to other prisoners as they use computers, at least theoretically without having actually holding them in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a profiling, which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 when he was in custody."</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambikaner reacted with anger on a corrupture case, in which a ruling member states returned to the workplace at the state apparatus, where the corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is a talking about Diodino Cambaza who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other defendants (approximately 800 000 euro) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>

<seg id="1259">"in accordance with an opinion of the General Public Prosecutor's Office, the proposal submitted, there would be no barriers to Cambaza to resume its old post, as the company did not accomplish a discipline."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants are not good."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Center for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, briefly CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, distributed in an interview with Deutsche Welle made the decision of the company to resume the Director."</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption, and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a setback with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to note is that the company should also have a lack of discipline in opposition to the states.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company's wiec apparently, however, and illustrates no proper legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosambian social media, rejects this behaviour as well and regards the case as a" "resistant" ":"</seg>

<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has frozen, into the company is reintated, which he helped make damage."</seg>

<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state, as a hand it turned around an inexhaustible financial source and the state itself has become tired, prunloaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although about the origin of the word still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people with indian origin or in general used as an adjective". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or a part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma within the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements of the word has given an extremely pictured killing.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that most commonly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight a speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"in this case, Kalar'Kalar may normally be associated with racism but the word itself is not automatically called Hassan."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed his hand, censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burmesan words with fundamental meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmically also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words as' Kalar Pae '(Camel),' Kalar oat '(curtain) or' kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookusers Aung Kaung Myat declared the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he enthuses the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in spiritual nature, whether they knew his back pain, by doing a word."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" "healing" "(ku) + the Fryword (la) on Burmically - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"in Win, zin Win is the opinion that they will reduce theatrical nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook analytical must be analytical, which spreading out all Posts that are committed in suspicion of racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation is not understood what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyze the post carefully and control it by checking the side words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example, Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar Pae" (alternator). "</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that this dirty nationalists spread, to spread the Hassan, a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcised its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often gets a cat- and mouse game, whereby the users can easily start social networks to express a new word or an alternative description of the stiff word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaze is described as Facebook began to delete his posts, as he just wanted to share his friends, that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and was prohibited by Facebook, posting and parts of content for 24 hours because the post office" "the Facebook Community Standards has not been met."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of Posts of people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate-speaking nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that nothing has to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post the author divided his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are badly."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to censor will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have such words as" chair "or" Pea curry "." "</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out they have made mistakes, they tried not to correct the falsisted Posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if only a little bit more respect for the 15 million benefits, they would give them a big turnover would be the great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship is made available to users for much dispatch among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users will now make sure via Facebook funny and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hassan, to see whether their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some Screenshots of Facebook-Posts, which contains no Hassan language, but still removed:"</seg>

<seg id="1331">The Burmical text reads "I want to sit on a chair and watch an inheritance curry and an Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1336">"in the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to extend their voices and their influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should also meet the violence in the churches in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was given for his failure to deceive the dazzling hate speech on its burmesan pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of taking the word 'Kalar', it would have better ongoing to swallow themselves more on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned of them."</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was released here as part of a content sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women avoid the greatest care to speak the name of their husbands or even of older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use an pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect that they should respect the husband's social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should abide by the norm."</seg>

<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health care, as well as housewives, a unique club, and so quickly became the main topic of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal that is operated by the community of Video Volunteers, and stands for the reduction of patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas worked for seven years with the help of her video camera to uncover practices, such as children's homes and AIDS, and heads these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reported how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them an ambassador of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini presented in its discussion round, was the case of women who do not name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation over the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to speak the name of her husband, he is not according to utterance, is a burning that they are all charged and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">That tradition testified that a woman wants her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not tolerate this, is regarded as being deposited, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round and never thought about it.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning Rohini, who has never called the name of her husband so far before, at home, try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband was still too long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I would call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in his luggage Rohini started its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" "Patriarchate". "some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the videoprojection, the women trying to get the discussion with a exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini bat every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, affectionate, affectionate, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, means that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the brisk of a centuries-old tradition, in which women may never speak the name of her husband. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she took only in the whole exercise; a different chose to let the full swing of frustration against him and his family by removing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenalin rush to have broken with an ancient Brother, the women decided that she would actually try at home to name their husbands in the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife could not stop his name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another clubmember decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she moved, she got fear and said that there was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said, I would do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less comprehensible and the situation of arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reported how women have tried to stop different practices, such as wearing the galvanic red point on the forehead, who shows the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the galvanic red point, if he would do it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs only and I listened to him to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not stop completely with them, but think they are now in a better position to choose even to do it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we are doing a trip with every discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to worry about women who could hear what could hear," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"for the first time they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sangen, and spoke about things that had never been thought of before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have made some things, for example how our identities are connected to our spouses, have never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been carried by Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it's okay, but some wanted a salary-spa, a broad-shirt over a pants, wear; they have not dreamed."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own closets, morals connected to the Saris and much more, jewellery Rohini their own pair of Kurdish (Upper hemden) into a discussion, so that women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they decided now to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is certain that they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed something, Rohini, that things slowly enter roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then listened to the name of her husband's name to say."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including myself, make it even, but only if they are alone and not any other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of her husband; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberrot at their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"women in the discussion field know that changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the solvein to be more freedom of movement, or their own closets - at the end of a hard to naviating river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"as they give each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"but this club, each of us gives us confidence that something will change."</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. it will give a chain reaction if every woman goes back home and other people about what we talk about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories about which is not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1684">The question may appear silly as Singapore is recognized at an international level as independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore was regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere. "</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Lawyers-Association of the State of New York, the Minister expressed that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support that Singapore was to be considered as a city.</seg>

<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had a lack of escape in front of the responsibilities."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons for Shangrin was not very nobel: it defends an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, in view of what he appeared invariably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore or New York should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core point of the subject, the good old cores of the authoritarian Machthans appears to be the vored democrats, the twisted logic, as they fit better to their power."</seg>

<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our werter K Shangrat would take the effort to clarify this point unless he was paid up, in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by adding on the blog his comment, he points to reading the critics concerning the critics of the conference so that one could understand the context of the statements made by Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the wording.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a city" "be a country," "he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so unequally important, even if we enjoy free and just choices."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He started Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party in decades?).</seg>

<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he really believes that he is really aware of what he defended."</seg>

<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for approximately 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with chatting, crumbling walls, and beds made of metal."</seg>

<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the most of his time indoors; sometimes he soothed his canvas, time to his computer, and again also to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or with nicotine lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which has been heard of them since 1967; the year, in which Israel had ended its occupation of the West Bank and had to escape from their village in Palestine, where she lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for now six years Hdaib is a passionate majority, the conservative majority is faced and their old proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and Rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics like orificalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian conflict, but also demands the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues do not only take place in his hometown Amman Relevance but also in cities that from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as a man who in his mind is not restricted by boundaries, and it can suffer according to the people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not exist openly, he defeated a special inclination against the American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas, anything with his identity as" Palestinian "escaped of the second generation too - so he says himself, even when he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own life circumstances so," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think that because I am a man, while in water soldered Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The former Soviet law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sensing hot junk little with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the clutches of the warm coffee and the recharge of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you take a look in the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, one simply avoids to do basic things - like being in public during the Ramadan water - to not land in jail."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently the interior of Jordan has said a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"a number of MPs, who support the Islamic Action Front in the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts of Hamed Sinno, to contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former spokesperson of the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that said the concert" "precisely because of sexual orientation of the Sangers."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many believe in addition, the engagement of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world may be dangerous activism which represents the old-proven legitimacy of an authoritarian regime in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila the jordained people as" "progressive supporters of human rights" "one who continued to decide for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is likely not easy to be silently rhetoric but in fact a more evident reality in Jordan reflect, which is clearly reflected in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in the year 2016 Hdaib traditional sex-men at Leibe, when he formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex prey."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a apparently lower unfamiliar woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women, who lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years in Jordan the number of 'Ehrenmores' has increased - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch concluded that the number of honors in 2016 reached their peak; however, it is still startling that Jordan, the institutional infrastructure is lacking to support the women, the victims tried out of domestic or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women may be held in prison on indefinite period of time, and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort, and the guarantee by the family is necessary that the woman has nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is known to go back to themes, which in its country is long as tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib argued that his work is politically, spatial, however, that he is his music, the full explicit invitations to sexuality, freedom and expression is not able to separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was challenged to politics," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and in" "Ghouteb" "is the focus on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of the songs that are politically politically, can be further developed."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a way in which you can, in his words," that can get what you want "- be it faith or non-faith, heterosexuality or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he notices that barely any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were still severely censored up to 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular Jordorian OnlineProgram Roya, to later remember that his comments from the context were torn down, and his opinion has been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals do not unequivoced the Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in memory still today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: when Abu Nuwhat was supposed to work on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century openly writing about homosexuality, why can Jordanier not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemitic kingdom, there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are to be silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the former news service took several former government representatives and members of the teacher association, with the rationale, they would have expressed confidence on comments in social media, which coincided with the deep in the land-root corruption."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"given the concert Hdaibs opinion, it is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has honed a show for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it is of slow, bedding and inner changes. it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Syrian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, of an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreams of not just dreamed of being his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region deals with music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streams, and on artificial nature. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is far, Hdaib will continue to operate, and therefore also to resist resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was facilitated by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting to which Aman heard as a student Fellow.</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the post" love message on Guerillakler, "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we just write love letter to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel amazed, affection attention?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question went to the two young Colombian activists from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios by the Young-Youth-Foundation by the Young-Youth-Foundation (letters for reconciliation) to write young people to write Guerillakappers.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"just recently, her country was in place of an historical event and they wanted to contribute to its part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with guerrilla warfare FARC (German: revolutionary Arbiens), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international was considered to be the subordination of the peace treaty, as significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, a long way before the Colombians, there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warfare that have lived many years in illegal bearings, who were exposed to the war of war, and around the clock have trucking their weapons in their arms, must now be integrated into the life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, which had accustomed to life in constant fear, and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla warfare, it must now take into their ranks and support them when building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Kolumbians would have to close together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have been written letters - love ambassador to former guerrilla warfare in order to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for any former guerrilla warfare - which can then be transferred to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for letters for reconciliation emerged on the world's summit of Nobel Peace Prize, which was held in February 2017 in Bogotá. there they had Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we love the people whom we love, on Valentine's day thousands of love-letter, but those forget that they need much more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he told him further, this year his love with people to share the most urgent promise."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus, the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and have to establish a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common story of peace. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters.</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombian such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana University of Cali, two members of the Municipal administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation to convey the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC did so on how they had done it earlier to take the precepts of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no precepts, but letters full of undermining people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all participants." it's incredible how many different emotions you can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between is "," told the political knowledge-student Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience like this:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we handed over the letters, a former fighters led me to the camp of the Guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a sort of cottage, where the guerrilla warfare live), I saw a guerrilla warfare, who wrote a little bit."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-Granatcher, a deadly weapon in the Dornrogue."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I spoke to him anyway and asked," "Hello, what do they do?" "he answered," I answered a letter that someone has written for me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life, someone has written something so beautiful, so I answered it. I suddenly ran the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him and set me next to the pomegers.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry, he was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighting, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life to war as war. to join the FARC, was the only way to forgive him and his six brothers in front of hunger." "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society out there, which is waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had all grown up as already war and the FARC were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leaders of the FARC made the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views over the peace process:" many years now, we have experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this size, it is worthwhile to overcome all the obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela has been impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people had never found hearing, and had no choice to know, and to realize that people that I have often seen as monsters and turned out even people with great feelings that were reversed by their lives and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does me sore."</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage to bring us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">"the Kolumbianern was prophesy, that after the disarming peace would reign."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to grasp the weapons to rise and to protest for their rights."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC have now put peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call on all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong to - about all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, do our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know from our own experience, that nothing is simply. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ humor in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines after several months ago, after reports have been published, covering the wear, torture and killing queer men in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"the first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaja Gaseta; she cast a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, the suspected queer men and put them in secret prisons in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew there."</seg>

<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as an honorary helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a acquaintance from Dagestan, a transformer that was put into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, he made a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his chanting friends, with the following message:" then there is no men more in Chechnya who can eliminate this shame?

<seg id="2260">Afterwards the photos of my documents made the round of WhatsApp's lap.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was straight away, I heard a few clicks from the back of my car, I heard a male's voice:" "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>

<seg id="2299">"for safety reasons I don't want to know their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it, without being able to register without hesitation, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and checs into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"in the moment when I call my mother to call on WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't think about, you blackest in security, just because you have left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, to what hotel you do. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we are not talking about the gender equality, however, this is a table theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kaukasy elements I still carry in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"so much I wish to overcome this seelic barrier, I cannot overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I say always that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chatting with camera, I actually give me trouble to see how the person arises from their past - so on my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the necessary information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"I talked with someone, the one and a half months left in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan, there were no human being arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he didn't closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with that, I mean, they probably load the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so-called" honour "through blood recovery has experienced."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still a gay men in these secrets?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there were just not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, especially those who have no rich relatives or have been left by their relatives to put a cavern in Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there so that one can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be converted, they will show their body on TV and claim they could have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not just gone, but targeted to radicalze."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a mutation or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I have just imprisoned someone who was inimprisoned one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people were gone to this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have since been nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">You simply took it away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and so called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"but until now, they were not presented as a bandits, but there have been no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have been allowed to shave this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called" "non-traditional" orientation, "already occurred in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already before 2003 I was already familiar to Grosny, when I lived there - and I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I had never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, then it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia was originally wanted to lead us to the" "civilisation", "but ultimately he was thrown back into the Stoneage."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia Law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had tinged eyelashes, carried out Röhrjeans and a short Tops. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the sharia has never warned me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and all the city knew; they knew why men, young people, there met."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been instructed.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "spotte not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it is often said to children, if that make yourself fun over sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never sinned, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace be held?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed to the prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us, but mainly on the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel like the people in the city started to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had suffered before and laughed, considered you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the Republic is constantly wasted."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"besides, I am still working as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"at present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacups, meetings, I accompany it to hospital and help them to get eating cards."</seg>

<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so is nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"that is exactly the same as those who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth, that there is no bobumps with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the Kabardiner have which, the Russians also have which; on the entire planet there are - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I am from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here are so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ramadan pro - live with men together.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"do you know, many think about transitional identity to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his generation to make more intimate experiences. but this is a trustee."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different kinds - two different types of sensation to be exactly, different lifestyles."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I will personally be here personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>

<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a large proportion of the Arab Ahwazi community is located, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult to argue for the native Arab population."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"in front of a century, the Arab Ahwaz was an predominantly autonome region in Iran, until the Pahlavi-monarchy took over the power and end up to 1925 big efforts to finish the ethnic autonomy in Iran."</seg>

<seg id="2435">"the following article is an overworked version of the opinion which was published by Ayomide, and originally published on the Afroféminas website. this article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with Frust."</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we generally have all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for instance, women nowadays are still less money in spite of the same education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent observation when it comes to what they can do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later occur in various areas of life to a smooth blanket, and that discrimination based on sex is still across the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware of me and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of this and I am twice and triple them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, if I talk to skin colour, on black CIS women, on black women in the LGBT women, on black women in the LGBTQ church, or on black women from the Diaspora, when I mention, on which kind we have been physically, seelic and verbal abuse, decide to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless, all agree that women - all women - should come together to sing" their voices and 'Kumbaya' to sing my Lord 'to achieve equal rights (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about it, in addition to sexualised violence a institutionalized form of racial violence, which we are exposed to two black women."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or that black women and women of other ethnicities, and of origin-places earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls are referred to in school with a migration background as a white girl because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand I want all women, all men and at all persons each have no skin colour, but on the other hand, I can consider myself as a black woman to take into account the white woman who refuse to take into account both the gender and the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I'm exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white-feminist oriented sphere, which repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women and again."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner said in 1851 in her speech," "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in historic respects is a human and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to connect me groupings, who also absorb our customs and customs, in order to drive their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to put white women the importance of overcutting skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to remain the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to vet them for a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional Feminism was founded to give women from different homes and to limit themselves from white feminism, is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I urge it to release me full of feminism, bringing me to the movement of wakanism, which is called for my darkened skin and my status as a woman, which is so stubborn as a novel phenomenon is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and set us into the spheres, which will be created for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womens: Reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves, in which they are able to defend ourselves completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be revered:"</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectionals feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines - to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement from which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanist environment I can raise black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman as a part of this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2627">"from the USA to India: how" "open source" "seed producers will change global food production"</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com site, a magazine that reports about solvents for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton trained in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company has 114 varieties, such as Outredded, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronaut in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"almost 20 years Morton's work has been removed only by its own ingenuity, and the question how many salvans can get limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green leaf or curved sheets."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years more, more such patents have been logged in more and more plants such as grain or carton varieties. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalist and atomic energy security concerns the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as an impassioned representative of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton is still salad, but since its work is more and more and more and more limitations."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as if in a river there is a rock-brock, around which I have to faint."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed any more of a new saluted, because all the features already patented. he makes it as good as possible and attempts to breed those features that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and tried to use no material, which is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he also joined a movement that is ever increasing in the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding (" Open Source "" breeding). "</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronomer of the International Space station ISS have red Römersalat the Sorte Outredded in the" "conservatory" "of the station and eaten. there it will be tested, whether plants can be grown in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area, and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for" "Open Source" "seed) can be inspired by the movement for free" Open Source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was called to life to ensure that some plants and gens are not protected as intellectual property, and so for plant breeders are permanent."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the context of the initiative, shortly Ossi, U.S. breeders can also undertake that others can use the seed of them bred seed."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed, and sell it." open source "breeder only allow others to breed their seed, to breed so its own varieties, and it is not immediately uttering - two aspects which are forbidden by many plant stations."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the empowered Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Vorancellor Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed, and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed plays an important role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to breed the latter not or only little by raising seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement is not employed with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants might be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not." "who's good, locally and sustainable produced vegetables, such as such as farmers are offered, should also know that the way of how this vegetables is bred."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional sovereign without seed-sousiveness is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the open source Seed initiative are committed to providing others to its seed, and thus to patrol their action in contrast, seed, and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supplies is endangered, since the available recovery is due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always limited, unmatched."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral work with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartel characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it available for plant breeders either at all or only scared."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are still no such estimates, but experts such as Luby suspected that mass-made plants are patented in even larger style as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of View</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants become so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments, and threats like pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patronutrients on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing for more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently unlawful than ever before, since changing conditions due to climate change are much worse predictable. "</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-speaker Carly Scaduto, that genetic variety are generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genres and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of United States, the company is setting up for the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it contradicts the view that intellectual property restricts other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varietties innovations. "a patent is basically a plan that each can follow as soon as the patent is expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection inhibit innovations not, but promotes it to be provided by the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the different: 20 years to wait for a patent of patent, and certainly no innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you are waiting for a long time waiting for plants to breed, which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, could have lost the battle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is however, that genetic resources have always been a general and still should remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be made impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton clue to the concept itself to patrol the plant and we do not really create the characteristics itself."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them themselves and as breeder, we finally have no idea how plants do it."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi pre-member state, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" "who bred a sorting, he also bred his own values into it."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes on industrial agriculture with great courtyards and monocultural believes in cultivation of massaging Herbizide, who are bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than monsanto are) patents possess, it creates the most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either reject them or hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder by the prevention of plant-patented innovative would:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patrol. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need a lot of new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors are going to sell my sorts within a few years ago," he says. "with a patent it is 20 years ahead of competition, which makes it very easy for my opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"while the US seems to be a leader in the" "open source" "breeding, the concept is fast approaching and fast all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, an" open source "seed program, working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organisation Agrecol works on an" open source "license, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding is different from country to country, whose Ossi obligation cannot be simply established one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive committee of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventional plants should not be patentable, and thus it speaks against the current practice of the European patent stands, which permits patents on conventional plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation still is not a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of plant breeders and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for" open source "seed systems, that the organization is currently taking a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems, for the planned next year of the official start signal."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger from environmental protection and development aid groups (including hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group to erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity globally to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - an association and aid organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report released, it represents that farmers must have the opportunity to improve seeds and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report also the importance of a manifold, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems stresses - a connection between the Luby von Ossi hopes that there will soon be more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has taken care of where and how something is grown, and seed systems have barely played a role, so Luby." we are now trying to dizze man, that is even more behind their foods. "</seg>

ANHRI confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the closure and do not add. we insist on to fulfill our task."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first cannated website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities approved for more than two months of 21 web pages such as bsp. the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and that from Qatar's network of Al Jazeera" because of alleged "support of terrorism".

<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada voiced to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"however, to bullock blogs is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>

<seg id="2739">"first I used it to the post of articles, to get the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
