this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular , that the N@@ SA heard illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret operation , in which the CIA was literally over@@ thrown for an atomic bom@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an unbelievable story .
but do you know who the chapter did not coinci@@ de ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government has established itself against reven@@ ge and asked him to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the pattern of government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if the media has not received this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones . &quot;
&quot; so as the government at R@@ isen he did something , what a lot of cour@@ ageous re@@ por@@ ters already did before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go to the prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the trial , something unusual . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although she had been campaign@@ ing for years that it is essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
&quot; rather , rather than to fail and get rid of the statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators are worried without the consent , his phone sp@@ elling secre@@ tly , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit , and even irrit@@ ation with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers and Ris@@ co &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much from their work as secret . &quot;
since 11 September almost every article about national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers was a journalist .
&quot; so we put the press work on the play , which is to be protected by the first constitutional delay , because the government has more possibilities to sp@@ ose all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology the government allows to handle the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; though they can take the moment in which they contact , instead of entering into account , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that has not yet been written as R@@ isen of his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source collection system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , which was originally developed from the Internet @-@ known Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I &apos;m working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; here you can upload documents to upload or information , as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agentur has access .
&quot; so , the government does not describe any more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information that would request it would be not available from the start . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect the press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments all over the world develop new sp@@ y technologies that thre@@ aten us all . &quot;
&quot; it is to make sure that not only technology den@@ omin@@ ator , such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to do mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; he wants to report about ab@@ uses in the supply of soldiers and wants to report by crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm goes to si@@ gh the water of Fl@@ int . or a pilgri@@ m insi@@ der who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest database of history published in tax hav@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness by a Declaration . &#93; This week we have been hidden from news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to go to companies such as Mos@@ bags Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
islands Prime Minister has resign@@ ed .
&quot; also , there are reports that a f@@ eit@@ ed of the brutal Syrian Dic@@ t@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad Brief@@ ing Companies in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin is leading , over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous c@@ elli@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others give you wait for the next publication , and the next enth@@ ron@@ ed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agent - gri@@ lled or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham .
&quot; it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we deal with what ?
&quot; however , the truth is : if the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , the media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide and wear -- something that we have been discussing and enth@@ used for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seems very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ d@@ angle .
&quot; so one company has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these prayers . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ ution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there have been no prominent Americans previously mentioned in these revelations that were sc@@ andal .
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle that these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ bags Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we would have a backup of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples to see the connections in the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to provide less information to start a company than to see a libr@@ arian . &quot;
this type of in@@ consistency in the US has allowed the employee of school@@ children to rip school@@ children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip especially to random investors .
it is this sort of behavior that all affects us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent an un@@ covered em@@ it@@ ters in the offices of 13 An@@ wal@@ ts@@ firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ators found himself as an African Minister , who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it truly sho@@ cked that all up to an attorney we made our investig@@ ator suggestions on how to trans@@ operate his money .
&quot; these were all pre@@ pre@@ aches . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was handed over to doing money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not about a single couns@@ el that has made suggestions for our glori@@ fy suggestions .
it is not about a single top police involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to complain that kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound all very well @-@ tim@@ ately , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing could ever have changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful ones . &quot;
but as born optim@@ ism I see that some things have begun to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen precau@@ tions to more transparency what the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU passes in central regi@@ sters at the national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a law firm in both parliament @-@ chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to provide more transparency in the United States and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people , who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy to stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transpar@@ ence is not good for business . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and campaign@@ ing for it , by laws this kind of in@@ consistency . &quot;
&quot; together we can termin@@ ate the in@@ consistency , which now allows this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ urs@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; one day after I had finished my design studies , I made an amb@@ assador . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da was standing and looked upon my stuff .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip throughout the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where is it that night ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; I do not know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; &quot; Oh , Man ! &quot;
what m@@ ach now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ el ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have an a@@ erial mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; in the night I was then in bed , I moved to the ceiling and thought : &quot; &quot; Oh Mann ! what have I built myself in ? &quot;
a wild in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such fear that I got out of bed , on the to@@ ken to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he bought from me depends today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my view completely .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stran@@ ger , actually friends who waited just to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to host people on my air mat@@ tresses , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ ou@@ ghing , my ro@@ omm@@ ates and the rent is raised . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can make it to turn fear in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new fellow people Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I over@@ lay how we could earn something . our apartment is a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we asked a website and en@@ rolled so &quot; air mat@@ tresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happ@@ ier guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress .
they found it super and we too .
&quot; I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ hat@@ s tasted completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we had to say thanks to our last guest , and the door into the castle fell , rigi@@ d Brian and I went . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Br@@ arc@@ zy@@ k , joined us as developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented ourselves to the Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website on which people open public pictures of their private spaces , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms , whose doors can be closed when visiting past . &quot;
over the internet you can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
but they do not act .
&quot; nobody who is still with con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a shop that is allowed to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if one has a problem , one can get up the things that you can do well . we could dis@@ continued . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create an immense trust by design , among people who have never met before . &quot;
can design be able to do something ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a tast@@ ers , which degree confidence we stri@@ ves . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your Com@@ fort@@ Rooms .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
&quot; now , I would like to tell you that you un@@ lock your mobile phone . &quot;
enter your place mobile phone with your left seat .
&quot; this silent flight from panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time . &quot;
because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel like to hold the cell phone of a foreig@@ ner in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
&quot; so , most of the guests feel when they are somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
only so , who is now Al Gor@@ es cell phone ? &quot;
could you announce that he has become the president of the President for the Office of the President ?
you can give the phone back now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we have changed a small detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbour would not be presented with his name ; if he would have told where he comes how his dog or his children hot ?
&quot; imagine you could have 150 Be@@ es@@ sm@@ ents , who say all : &quot; &quot; he can really cl@@ ing very well @-@ kept hand@@ ys ! &quot;
how would you feel if you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ designed feedback system strengthens the confidence .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their jud@@ g@@ ments before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are with regard to age and residence . &quot;
little surprising we trust the people most who are most like us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social transformation .
this is exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents .
&quot; if one has less than three evalu@@ ations , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , it changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation is simil@@ arities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; moreover , we learned that trust is dependent on how much one can get from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if one told too little as for example &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; you get rather no answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells a lot , as for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- , the request is also rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; &quot; T@@ olle artwork in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
&quot; we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on what topics to write something . &quot;
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
&quot; what we did not expect , was the great multitude of people who were more than willing to put these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people are eligible for our offer .
one can see three things .
&quot; first , : incredibly good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , a need , which previously was not covered . &quot;
for us the business is just very good .
&quot; of course , there are times when not all is smoothly running . &quot;
there were guests who have been unt@@ allowed parties or appart@@ ments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I have been working with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence has been broken .
there is nothing wrong than this calls . it hur@@ ts if I just think .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the an@@ ru@@ fer , it was and always will be our greatest motivation to continue to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , among the 123 million people had only a fraction ever a fraction ever . &quot;
because people trust each other too right .
&quot; when confidence works , it can be mar@@ vel@@ ous . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him in the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers , who tend to tend to suffer from sensitive activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Al@@ ej@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels , who save one life , even though they don &apos;t know it correctly . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want to feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
they can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay runs .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are just what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled about this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is here about economic trade .
&quot; but now it is simply &quot; &quot; Rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships
people take part of themselves and that changes everything .
&quot; if you travel nowadays , this is compared with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic . &quot;
but what if trips would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what would be , if in any place you have visited , a group of announ@@ cements that would have to be thorough , and to show a bar with a bar , one which has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays apartments are designed based on privacy .
what if we would like to make apartments from the ground up to the meeting ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of the common ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and separation . &quot;
&quot; in South @-@ south of the city of Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces belonging to the government , &quot;
&quot; residents were now offered . students , who were looking for a lead , &quot;
&quot; were convey@@ ed to people whose children were killed . there were inc@@ ub@@ ator@@ programs , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries are hosted by a foreig@@ ner or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us .
we have not invented the wheel newly .
hospitality there was also before .
there were similar sites before us .
so why did our work work ?
&quot; aside from luck and tim@@ ing , we noticed that one can find the proper design with the components of the trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ root prejudi@@ ces .
I find the ast@@ o@@ unding ;
straight to overwhelming .
I have to think every time when a red Maz@@ da goes over to me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it was able to help us if it had such big influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when to watch me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or suppres@@ sed , a bra@@ in@@ thi@@ ans , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in safety at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
thus the media represent people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
&quot; studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people do not speak with their drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , It is great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee @-@ owner -- a dou@@ ter Esp@@ res@@ so , with Sah@@ ne extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
a Mö@@ ller @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ age
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslims . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , Baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to decide .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual person as some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friend@@ ships were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lus@@ tige was : back then it was for me a femin@@ ist independence , and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old I felt a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not just believed the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought after , presented in question , doub@@ ted and believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and long devotion to deep@@ ened with each reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wines .
I imagine myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone takes you full , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels like .
&quot; later I married and began , as all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had to end up breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; Lat@@ est . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flo@@ ats in buildings , people sp@@ ill out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my lap changed quickly in rebellion .
why should you do something ?
&quot; I moved the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country attacked but in the N@@ u , the actions of others turned into a suspic@@ ious . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start the study program . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I die - when we die , so deeply it went in my seat , and I feared myself that the first time was to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we moved in this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I saw , and I read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d carefully &quot; , &quot; &quot; lead in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; sam@@ pled you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week of it .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a target . &quot;
I saw the complete reporting .
&quot; feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who held for Muslims , into the Free , and proposed . &quot;
there was really brand@@ y on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right now .
&quot; because people who attacked this country , have attacked our country . &quot;
I sh@@ aken the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to have to explain itself to yourself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
&quot; these are the accus@@ ations , which are hard . &quot;
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak about my church like a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or good ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our one as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor can only be found under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the US body , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , sth@@ and and Olympi@@ oni@@ ken . &quot;
will make the closure of Mo@@ vies America safer ?
&quot; maybe there will be a few parking spaces , but do not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit to a mosque leads to view people of other faith toler@@ ant , and to show greater civil participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radi@@ cal@@ ing process , one has noticed that he can start online . as First , the person is cut off from her church , even by her family , that the extre@@ mes is able to kill the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ or their behavior and its ideology is a tra@@ itor , or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally a group like IS was founded their brut@@ ality with the Quran .
&quot; as Muslims , as a mother , as a human being , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to her imagination , if one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology to their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; but if one thro@@ ws a look at it , it doesn &apos;t cycle that they appear in their &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality which allows them to read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding I@@ mam recently told me an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she would pre@@ ach to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought the silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , they would only bring into trouble . &quot;
&quot; by nothing inspired and something that had given to their anger , it was a main target for the instrument@@ alization by the extre@@ mi@@ sts that gave her a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam gave the connection to God and its church again .
&quot; rather than to blame for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept before to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family are concerned .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how affects the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy based on our thoughts of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear , pass at least three things . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian administration system , con@@ form@@ ance and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if one has reported the individuals news , in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an ak@@ ade@@ mis@@ tic problem .
&quot; when you look when the mood against Muslims turn left -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
&quot; it happened in the advance of the Iraq war , and during the two election period . &quot;
&quot; thus , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected it . &quot;
it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public to conc@@ eive the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear sh@@ es us all . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of coll@@ ectiv@@ ism , it is not just about having to declare itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both of them went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a spor@@ tsmen .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , much promise ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , generous man , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is from my Brü@@ der@@ l@@ ein such a sealed young man has become ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , which was in the afternoon to visit him . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after he posted expres@@ sions against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he enjoyed eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we occupy it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we left to our children , one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the Kinder@@ sitz we went well , with high pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , moved my shoes , went into prayer sh@@ alle , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement , printed and was welcome our guests , for half of the gathered Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who have come to take care of ourselves but to assist us . &quot;
in this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and sympathy panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number safe ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than those .
thank you .
thanks beautiful !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a min@@ v . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say , that perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with dr@@ au@@ ght , i.e. an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say does not f@@ ool you . I am totally normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look for Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study among Muslims around the world , people want to normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want wealth for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am not an exception in any respect .
&quot; if people like an exception to the rule appear , then the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for craf@@ ting , is briefly before that to become a billion @-@ line business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for industrial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air pact spl@@ itting into our social consciousness , has built a aut@@ on@@ ome fleet of air machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France in front of an audience a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . a few years ago they began to fly with soap . &quot;
through inter@@ locking passengers reach high speed and acceler@@ ation in the narro@@ west space .
you can also build up self @-@ sufficient structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry the bur@@ dens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
&quot; today , we would like to present you some of our new projects . &quot;
our aim is to cross the limits of Pos@@ sible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; thus , a system of aut@@ on@@ ome works , it must be collective ad@@ mitting where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynam@@ ical Tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alised technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a off@@ springs of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; any air @-@ machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations on board , which should do what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands can be found at the highest ec@@ e. eg &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter , &quot;
&quot; an air device , that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the down@@ ward flight , much more efficient than helic@@ opter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
&quot; a restriction of h@@ eck@@ star@@ ters is , that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind ar@@ ches . &quot;
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often introduce basic abstract questions related to the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smaller number of mo@@ ve@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ opter are known approximately as machines with a thousand moving parts that work together to hurt you .
&quot; several decades ago , trained pil@@ ots were able to fly @-@ controlled air devices that had only two moti@@ ons : a prop@@ eller and a h@@ eck@@ ru@@ der . &quot;
&quot; far , we discovered that flies are with only one works . &quot;
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ apping , hing@@ es and cross @-@ rests , no further actu@@ ator or control rooms , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is simple , happens in the inner life very much , so it can be stable and can move around in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ eli@@ hood of throwing it exactly right if all of me , is low , that &apos;s why I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ ic is a exercise in gen@@ u@@ ity , this machine is here , the bus copies with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ers , a exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is just symmet@@ rical .
&quot; therefore , he is ambi@@ valent in its alignment . &quot;
&quot; thus , he gets the proper ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned , or even like it rotating . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propaganda . &quot;
&quot; some things are adjustable in models , the rest will be learned directly at the flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our day , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
these are revol@@ t in the clo@@ ck@@ wise sense
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them together they act like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
&quot; however , something wrong - a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if it is limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by making a half plane .
the last demonstration studied syn@@ thesi@@ zers .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took negoti@@ able Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and provide them with loc@@ alised technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit white , where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine that I would like to practice on Broadway a flying lamp .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the wages lies in the development and the act of creativity .
&quot; it serves as a memory , as wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it is creative , smart gri@@ ps allowed to form them in the most spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , created in a very distant galax@@ y two black holes each other more quickly , they walked so the mass of three suns in a tenth of a tenth of pure energy . &quot;
this short moment they shining more bri@@ ghter than all stars along with all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big boy .
but their energy do not put them in the form of light .
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was given into the space @-@ time texture itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let &apos;s arrange the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago became a multi @-@ piece life on Earth .
&quot; since then , the earth has brought a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sauce , people and -- God stand for us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group was particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss of MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- to seek a huge laser det@@ ector to seek the gravity of the gra@@ vit@@ ational black holes . &quot;
most they remembered for crazy .
but enough people realized them as crazy gen@@ ies so the US National Science Foundation have financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , construction , design and extremely much hard work , they built the Det@@ ector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could be substantially increased , resulting in the recognition performance enormously improved . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one calls him Advanced L@@ IG@@ O . &quot;
&quot; early September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a final test run , in order to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the far@@ ewell from my to@@ d@@ ill father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all that I had worked for what I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist and their through observ@@ at@@ ories such as L@@ IG@@ O measurable signals . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a c@@ ision in the plum@@ age of space and time .
&quot; when the wave tran@@ scen@@ ding the wave , the space and its whole content are stretched into one direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; to illustrate , lectur@@ ers in courses for rel@@ ational theory often lead a properly competitive dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves is extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us were stretched in the waves of the waves , and expanded . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 N@@ ul@@ ls after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st intest@@ ine , we explained the L@@ IG@@ O staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thousands of the radius of an atomic nuclear . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text over gravity
&quot; K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves like this : &quot; the technical difficulties with the construction of such determin@@ ants are vast . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are fin@@ alised , and with the support of the general public all the obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott holds pleasure , L@@ IG@@ O is more than one ear as one eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial lifts , the size of your hand . &quot;
this is quite handy . because so you can create an image or a map of things by taking the light of the coming light around you .
with fool@@ ish is that different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult to make a picture of things , which mean to you especially much : &quot;
the face of your child is approximately .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties such as sound , rhythm and volume , rhythm and volume , in order to close to the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now speaks just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can no simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by changing changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
&quot; at least , for L@@ IG@@ O the reported frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area . &quot;
&quot; so if we convert wave @-@ mu@@ ster in sc@@ all , we can literally listen to the all . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ v@@ itation of lau@@ ghing , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
SH : two black , non @-@ turning holes , circul@@ ating simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turning the two body very fast , you hear the same circle with an additional key change . this sounds like W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement , shaped to the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date which at least I never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O Fol@@ der : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ der@@ usch &#93; J@@ em@@ and , who knows what he has to hear , see this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which is about as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ er . &quot;
AA : thinking about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns that others with a mass of 36 suns that revol@@ ve hundreds of times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the constant significance of L@@ IG@@ O .
&quot; L@@ IG@@ O opens up a completely new way to study the al@@ ls , as it has never been possible before . &quot;
this is the way we can listen to the universe and the invisible .
much in all we can see -- virtually or basically -- do not see .
&quot; a Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ ked stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes occur but at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers from iron , carbon and si@@ lic@@ on . &quot;
we will never go through since these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the ur@@ b@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the judgment is shining through its own image . &quot;
&quot; using gravity shafts , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
and that is most important : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen before that we have never seen before and of which we have no idea what we can only discover by hearing .
&quot; in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found right in the first leg of things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this subject : me : the type of stars , which rise black holes , such as L@@ IG@@ O she observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the sauce for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; L@@ IG@@ O gives us a completely different perspective on the events of all , the emergence of the stars , and finally on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
&quot; thanks to L@@ IG@@ O , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the sound and p@@ ant@@ elop@@ es of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ at@@ ories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried a experiment .
&quot; one year long I would say to everything &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; in which I feared . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , me in unpleasant situations , I forced me &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
wanted to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly that to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared that my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speeches to keep my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; I changed . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain thing that my life was deeply changed , on an un@@ expect@@ ancy . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; kit@@ ties , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kitt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once I could play with her , when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; of a new attitude towards my family . from there I swe@@ ar to play with them , as soon as you go on . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; fast . I am not perfect , but I am trying very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an intri@@ gu@@ ing side effect : only in short , I actually understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; was saved to play with my children my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things off you wake up to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I generate television .
I make television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; each program provides hundreds of jobs , which previously did not exist . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days of four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series will run on Thursday nights .
around the world I run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of this 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts , which I myself created , and not just produced , so still ob@@ end@@ lessly . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the bon@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still making ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I would not like to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say it to you , so all of you who work so hard if you now speak a company , a country or a household , so I understand that I &apos;m not just talking on the computer and I say , I realize that there is no dre@@ aming in a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I have absorbed into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land from nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set troops on , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; so as portraits , you get a high tone , provided a marathon . &quot;
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ern@@ al , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work runs well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could always go on her . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I tell them the bu@@ zz , that I persu@@ aded writing that writing me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , this does it . &quot;
&quot; but the bu@@ ck -- when I started working with television production , when I began to work and work , build , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this energy . the sums ! &quot;
the sums is more than writing .
the sums of action is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the sums of music . the sums is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have so much sums , then you can not strive for size . &quot;
&quot; feeling , not to be different than seek size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is what you call the sums .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is called genius .
maybe it is called ego .
perhaps it is fear of failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I know only that I &apos;m not for failure , and I just know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I do not want to ask it . &quot;
&quot; to make clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things the more things the more watching me , the more I write history , all the more expectations there . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to succeed , the more you have to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country , which I created , the marathon , which I walk , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz . &quot;
I like this sums . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then stops the sums .
&quot; revised , exagger@@ ated , exagger@@ ated , burned down . &quot;
the sums stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that her mom is a single working no@@ bility .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Behold , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Country . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the bu@@ zz heard . &quot;
the sums of the engine is hidden .
I no longer loved my job . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my sums was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans @-@ work , 15 hours @-@ days , performed weekends , no rep@@ ent@@ ment , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan Sle@@ ep does not exist , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was an interview @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the sums I was .
&quot; so what are you doing , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you from , bl@@ ö@@ der author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you have to love what you do , one ban@@ ker to be a ban@@ ker , a painter , Bill Gates know if you knew the bu@@ zz , when you didn &apos;t know the sums you do , who is one then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart is listening , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then I put my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; a question .
&quot; I am on the way to the outside , late so that she says : &quot; &quot; Mama , you are playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I want to say no , than two things will be aware of : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not . &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; kit@@ ties . &quot;
when is this happened ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan I and my sums have bet@@ ray , and here everything is changing my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , you are playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
that is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude , and in the absence of the sum , I can do nothing except to fit . &quot;
I am foc@@ ussed .
I am silent .
&quot; the country , which I created , the marathon , which I walk , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax glands and the song , in which it comes to release , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Iron Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so little that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
the opposite is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes down and an energy drive comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums come slowly .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sums . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let us remain at the matter .
it is love . this is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the working environment , the Tit@@ an@@ en@@ sum@@ men , this is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I &apos;m telling you who I am when I describe myself with broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours , and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums is . &quot;
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not working @-@ specific .
it is dependent on joy .
the real sums depends on love .
the sums is the current that comes from the life of life .
genuine sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums ign@@ ores the pressure of history , which did go to running tasks , the anticip@@ ation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; the real sums is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps escap@@ ed me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan I ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I do this as a rule so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any guilt .
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no other option if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I am not good at playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; playing , I do not lie in any way as working . &quot;
the truth is hur@@ ting
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I preferred to work at the workplace as a home .
&quot; conc@@ ession is painful , because what kind of man works rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; time honest , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we r@@ asen in the garden around , ahead and back . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play Ball .
we cr@@ ashes soap @-@ bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent , and confused . &quot;
I am always looking for my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe met me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ended with the games ?
you can also say it ! tell them always yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
&quot; then you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at a maximum of 15 minutes , until they st@@ ables that they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a bad@@ min@@ et@@ le or K@@ eks replaced me .
&quot; and speak my teenage girl all 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; each can bring 15 minutes at a piece , even on a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in !
&quot; my children are my welfare , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is to feel the bu@@ zz to have a place for his soul lovers . &quot;
&quot; it is not about playing with their own children . it is about pleasure , &quot;
about the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and keep it out .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I sc@@ iss@@ ors and I victories . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; stands just for everything I got up when I got my first TV show , when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to make myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why not full 15 minutes treat ? &quot;
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seems to return if I do not work .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months opens up a door , the energy flows in , and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown melody , she met me and my soul . she crossed me to new ideas . I don &apos;t use it to new ideas and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz I do not ... not anymore .
&quot; soap @-@ bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my sums .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
the bu@@ zz of the work is part of me but just a part . and for this I am so grateful .
&quot; it is a sn@@ ap that I am a Titan I . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire burn .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ ck . the country , which I gained , the marathon , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ ck , the more this unusual , be@@ ati@@ ful , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think things I awake you to life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
titles have no chance here .
&quot; want you play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a severe stroke or a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgery , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a constant , heavy handi@@ cap . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I have been surgical neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the most famous one of the &quot; &quot; woo@@ dy stimulation &quot; . &quot; it impl@@ anted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that neurological function improves . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kin@@ son , which suffered severe tre@@ m@@ bling and heavy pain . &quot;
neuro@@ modu@@ lation however does not mean Ne@@ uro healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with a little help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading Ober@@ st@@ ine and worked day and night in the emergency .
often found patients with sk@@ ull @-@ shepherd @-@ trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that in sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ mas sh@@ ears the brain and the sk@@ ull pressure .
to save life is dimin@@ ishing the sk@@ ull pressure .
&quot; for this , you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ quar@@ ed brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing the bra@@ ined brain mass , we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to let cells grow from a tissue , is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it made Jean @-@ François .
he saw he under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with great green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the Bi@@ ology lessons that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . you are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal tri@@ bal cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are im@@ mor@@ tal .
but these cells stopped differently .
they were divided slowly and after a few weeks she even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but it was different . &quot;
&quot; we needed long to understand how they came .
you come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ ine @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our large @-@ hir@@ ri@@ rin@@ se cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the funeral of the brain .
but why stay it to us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find it close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear however - of these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , which allows brain healing . &quot;
this was what we had to prove .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
we wanted to see a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells in the same way as Jean @-@ François did
&quot; and they then highlight colored , in order to be able to pursue them in the brain . &quot;
in the last step we rei@@ m@@ ded it at the de@@ fl@@ est@@ al of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ spl@@ antation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we provo@@ ke these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we provo@@ ke the same cells into bra@@ ised brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we lost the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely dis@@ ed after a few weeks as if they were taken away , they go back home . the room is already occupied , so they will not disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added a violation of and rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ant exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they sail@@ ed to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have ri@@ pen@@ ed .
&quot; evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells , which we are in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual work@@ book .
they had to take for@@ pell@@ ets from a tray .
they made it very well .
when they had reached a stable dex@@ ter@@ ment level we have achieved in the motor cor@@ tex cor@@ tex .
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move her hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in people , she recovered spontaneous up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plasti@@ fic@@ ated brain mechanisms . they go to a certain degree , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ ant his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left you will see the monkey , which is spont@@ aneously recovered . &quot;
he can bring about 40 % to 50 % of his original power from violation .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see , when we draw the cells of rei@@ m@@ apped : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and use later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Par@@ kin@@ son . &quot;
&quot; however , our dream is still to impl@@ ant them in humans . &quot;
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to heal itself . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne that is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need this . &quot;
I am definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on people . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilo@@ grams of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time to have a lot of patience and a professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have finished research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies . if you continue to look forward to the future , how many years it takes to come to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi@@ centralized study . &quot;
you have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment any time .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the dis@@ rup@@ tive plant that is in reality , but as a inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ change@@ able stub@@ born .
we believe that capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great rep@@ atri@@ sts in Beijing have undoubtedly proven that it is quite possible to thri@@ ving a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambig@@ uous as a finance minister in Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not likely to influence the austerity programmes that were implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there might be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my cri@@ tic friends told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished when they would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group in a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are mixed , our future d@@ ü@@ ster and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point out you on an interesting contradiction - the currently our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin summit &quot; &quot; par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the school @-@ mountain , who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the school @-@ mountain , &quot;
but few recognize its twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is considered to be anxi@@ ous , however , where it would be productive , where it would be productive and in@@ comes to bring , with which you need to bring the debt of debt and also all the things that humanity urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months have been invested in the U.S. , in England and the Eurozone , in all the prosperity producing goods , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ llion dollars sounds like a lot of money , until it compar@@ es with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ llion US dollars , which had at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing about the bor@@ rowing and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital make up the twin summit , which cannot be distinguished by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the results are stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year old in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently , a low economic demand that would not invest in which they could not invest . just like oils , the prophecy of the organ might be true that his son would kill him if he grows , &quot;
&quot; un@@ aware of the circumstances , guiding the circumstances that oils are killing him . &quot;
this is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely ven@@ erable Art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth . &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
I believe already . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed off course too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to under@@ min@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these proportions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they were involved in the working arms , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive is to them the right to political co@@ determination in questions of the cou@@ sins . &quot;
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held for a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which is very light illuminated , it is also quickly expanded . &quot;
&quot; however , our present liberal democr@@ acies have not their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for the ruling class . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came only until now , as a complete separation from politics and economics , and the democratic process has been incorporated into politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations have been a more democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our today &apos;s democr@@ acies since the time , in which this separation of politics and business began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , and the economy gradually emig@@ rated to politics . &quot;
are you wondering why the politicians have no more so than before ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of its DNA .
&quot; it is the fact that one can still be in the government today , and yet it is not at power because the power of politics cannot be separated into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ dern with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a flock of rob@@ bery , which so lasting the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated , that they are at the end of that . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that grows so far beyond the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of corporations grows , political goods are cancelled , economic demand falls , and the managing director of corporations are frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their firms . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy back , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control , thus , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , the women and the foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t really good .
&quot; the teaching from the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be , that the working poor is reg@@ ained only by a miracle , as in the ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : to create the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ omy employed by automation and robot .
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ating the twin summit , the wast@@ age of hab@@ itable , and social conflicts deeper , just as I think -- as soon as I think -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we must re@@ connect the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and in doing so , we end the re@@ unified field of democracy , otherwise we end the movie &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the question is not whether capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements he will survive . &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to the &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; similar to the &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in which machinery will serve the people and put people into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
&quot; I believe , we must be optim@@ istic . &quot;
&quot; so what br@@ is it , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation I would like to introduce you , in all brief , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies , please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital is working to you from a job to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and dis@@ solve and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but do not work in it , and workers who work there ; no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and sp@@ ar , and ultimately no em@@ powering twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please briefly face that our national currencies would have freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 biggest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; is present in the interest of all mankind . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the overall world trade is tr@@ aded in this currency -- call it &quot; &quot; cosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the merch@@ ant of the respective country to a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment resources . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not realise the technical means at that time .
&quot; today , we have them , especially in the context of a re@@ united policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ally , in which they favor@@ ed privileged people , and Marx@@ ian because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the M@@ ül@@ men &apos;s history , and key@@ n@@ esian , globally key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
are we awakening in such a world
&quot; or are we in a &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ ack teeth ? &quot;
the answer depends on how we work together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ union of politics and economy is ... do we do that , technological development will produce a massive decline in economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we &apos;re currently experiencing it , it will not only be our democr@@ acies but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ational democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just like Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist and how Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also fully equipped . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are at ease . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r , you do not think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosop@@ hical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your presentation mentioned Singapore and China , and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think of the view of the West on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the sem@@ bl@@ ance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of the de@@ plays , -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , when I must say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resem@@ bles that today the England of the 19th century . &quot;
because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake that is historically considered .
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
&quot; he was particularly skep@@ tical , which concerns the democratic development . &quot;
&quot; what one can now observe in China , resem@@ bles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now seems to do that , what the West has done in the 19th century itself , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as a finance minister from the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I know that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back to the first half months later ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to catch a new one with the euro zone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely we say goodbye to self @-@ suff@@ iciency , and the perpet@@ ual denial of the eurozone was carried out , and continues to substantially reduce the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek accus@@ ation -- by the way , the first proposal was to open the denial . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone is elected within the European group , continuing the denial . &quot;
&quot; but you know , what comes . &quot;
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable , due to political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism it will be able to delay in a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- harv@@ ester ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister there , after 6 months in office , especially in such tense situation , he made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was an honest interest on the pages of the don@@ ors , finding a common solution . &quot;
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government to fall , only because they did not want to deal with the tension caused by the Eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
none of the tro@@ ika credit@@ ors who has imposed us this policy : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake .
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive table of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if not survived , the released tile forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not alone be cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we urge ourselves to hit the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , that it seems to me it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thanks so much that you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price did most have never heard , even though he is probably responsible for 22 medium @-@ sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is conductors of Amazon Studios ;
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has a long @-@ term and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for making the shows and the content that they will produce Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought branch . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy may not select any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right at this corner . &quot;
&quot; this turn is the evaluation distribution of more than 2,500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows can get this review . &quot;
&quot; when your show is rated nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; breaking bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addi@@ ctive , where , after going to have a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you what goes on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence to be &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average expression , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , that &apos;s why Roy wants to risk nothing . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses with a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can see each free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon becomes free for free things , it is att@@ acking right ? &quot;
millions of spect@@ ators are watching these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who will receive everything .
&quot; when you collect , when to start the show when you are p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts you ski@@ ps or again look . &quot;
&quot; they collect millions of data to determine with these data , which show them should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and from it arises the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
do someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of that curve 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House laun@@ ches on average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find out a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team have shown the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use these data to find out these little details about the spect@@ ators : what shows they like what producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had together all the parts , they went a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has suffered a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; receives a 9,@@ 1 rating on this corner . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; it has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you coll@@ ects millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should be able to make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you can optim@@ ise it through very powerful computer .
&quot; that is what you can expect , is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis is not working , then this is a bit frigh@@ tening because we live in a time in which we have more and more to take statistics in order to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does someone know the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
&quot; no . OK , this is even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this space ever comes into touch with this software . come in touch with this , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in the United States and for dismis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether an dismis@@ sal is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , which can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite of the many data , &quot;
this is not always the best results created . this is not the fact that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most diversi@@ fied companies are even wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can be predicted by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the lim@@ b way , predic@@ tions - by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success was introduced in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year round by year until it is suddenly no longer functional , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the most diversi@@ fied companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors influ@@ x in decisions made by life a -- on the workplace , in the dispute , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ think@@ able many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or developing a drug . over the years I have recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; as the First enter this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , you set the items again to sum@@ mar@@ ise a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you need to do this several times , but there are always two things to take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something that the brain is good , it is parts and pieces come together again , even if the information is incomplete , so if the information is incomplete , especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe I was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they used data and mind where they are also in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , why not they would have been able to understand all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; that does not stand up in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision . &quot;
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions first than they have broad@@ cast@@ ed around TV @-@ ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a Show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they were able to say : &quot; we say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data are starting to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and not to forget that this device is pretty useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ e- or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most probably &quot; -- exactly here in this moment .
I will get it later with a technology demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions made in my life so that I should have heard in the ball on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a lot of way to make data analysis in order to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the structure .
&quot; in this way , perhaps the ball will be cl@@ ums@@ y and cl@@ ever@@ ly . ultimately it is possible to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging message that , despite the large amount of data still pays off , choices to meet , an expert in what you are doing and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
