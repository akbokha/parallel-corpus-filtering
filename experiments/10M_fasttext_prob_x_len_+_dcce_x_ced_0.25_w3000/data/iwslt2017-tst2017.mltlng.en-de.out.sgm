<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular, that the NSA heard illegal telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US secret operation, in which the CIA was literally overthrown for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not coincide?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for nearly 10 years, the government has established itself against revenge and asked him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistleblowers, to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if the media has not received this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so as the government at Risen he did something, what a lot of courageous reporters already did before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go to the prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the trial, something unusual."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although she had been campaigning for years that it is essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather, rather than to fail and get rid of the statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators are worried without the consent, his phone spelling secretly,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit, and even irritation with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblowers and Risco's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect Whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much from their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">Since 11 September almost every article about national security has been the result of a whistleblowers was a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the play, which is to be protected by the first constitutional delay, because the government has more possibilities to spose all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology the government allows to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"though they can take the moment in which they contact, instead of entering into account, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that has not yet been written as Risen of his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source collection system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed from the Internet-known Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I'm working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"here you can upload documents to upload or information, as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agentur has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so, the government does not describe any more information secretly, and many of the information that would request it would be not available from the start."</seg>
<seg id="36">"Securedrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect the press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments all over the world develop new spy technologies that threaten us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to make sure that not only technology denominator, such as Edward Snowden have a way to do misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"he wants to report about abuses in the supply of soldiers and wants to report by crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm goes to sigh the water of Flint. or a pilgrim insider who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the largest database of history published in tax havens.] [what does that mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer of Global Witness by a Declaration.] This week we have been hidden from news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosbag Fonseca."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to go to companies such as Mosbags Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that a feited of the brutal Syrian Dictator Bashar al-Assad Briefing Companies in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin is leading, over a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others give you wait for the next publication, and the next enthroned documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent - grilled or a John-Grisham.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we deal with what?</seg>
<seg id="54">"however, the truth is: if the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, the media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and wear -- something that we have been discussing and enthused for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seems very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matryodangle.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one company has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these prayers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no prominent Americans previously mentioned in these revelations that were scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle that these tax havens work, Mosbags Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we would have a backup of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples to see the connections in the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to provide less information to start a company than to see a librarian."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of inconsistency in the US has allowed the employee of schoolchildren to rip schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip especially to random investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this sort of behavior that all affects us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an uncovered emitters in the offices of 13 Anwaltsfirms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators found himself as an African Minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">It truly shocked that all up to an attorney we made our investigator suggestions on how to transoperate his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all prepreaches. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was handed over to doing money. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single counsel that has made suggestions for our glorify suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top police involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to complain that kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound all very well-timately, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing could ever have changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful ones."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as born optimism I see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen precautions to more transparency what the owners of companies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU passes in central registers at the national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a law firm in both parliament-chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to provide more transparency in the United States and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people, who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy to stand up and say," Intransparence is not good for business. ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and campaigning for it, by laws this kind of inconsistency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can terminate the inconsistency, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazursed."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I had finished my design studies, I made an ambassador."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda was standing and looked upon my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip throughout the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where is it that night?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," "I do not know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" "Oh, Man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What mach now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says, he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazel!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have an aerial mattress. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"one voice in my head said," "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"in the night I was then in bed, I moved to the ceiling and thought:" "Oh Mann! what have I built myself in?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I got out of bed, on the token to the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he bought from me depends today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger, actually friends who waited just to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to host people on my air mattresses, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a time, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost ploughing, my roommates and the rent is raised."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can make it to turn fear in fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new fellow people Brian Chesky:" Brian, I overlay how we could earn something. our apartment is a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We asked a website and enrolled so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happier guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure our cheese-ham-hats tasted completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we had to say thanks to our last guest, and the door into the castle fell, rigid Brian and I went."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Brarczyk, joined us as developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented ourselves to the Investors:" we want to create a website on which people open public pictures of their private spaces, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms, whose doors can be closed when visiting past. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet you can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody who is still with consolation, would invest in a shop that is allowed to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if one has a problem, one can get up the things that you can do well. we could discontinued."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create an immense trust by design, among people who have never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be able to do something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a tasters, which degree confidence we strives."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your ComfortRooms.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to tell you that you unlock your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your place mobile phone with your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this silent flight from panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel like to hold the cell phone of a foreigner in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most of the guests feel when they are somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so, who is now Al Gores cell phone? "</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce that he has become the president of the President for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can give the phone back now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour would not be presented with his name; if he would have told where he comes how his dog or his children hot?</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you could have 150 Beessments, who say all:" "he can really cling very well-kept handys!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-designed feedback system strengthens the confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their judgments before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are with regard to age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most who are most like us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social transformation.</seg>
<seg id="181">This is exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three evaluations, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, it changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we learned that trust is dependent on how much one can get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if one told too little as for example" "Hi!" "you get rather no answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells a lot, as for example:" "I have problems with my mother" -- --, the request is also rather not accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal level of openness, such as" "Tolle artwork in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">"we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on what topics to write something."</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we did not expect, was the great multitude of people who were more than willing to put these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people are eligible for our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first,: incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need, which previously was not covered."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not all is smoothly running."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been untallowed parties or appartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I have been working with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing wrong than this calls. it hurts if I just think.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the anrufer, it was and always will be our greatest motivation to continue to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, among the 123 million people had only a fraction ever a fraction ever."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust each other too right.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when confidence works, it can be marvelous."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, who tend to tend to suffer from sensitive activities."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels, who save one life, even though they don't know it correctly."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait, while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want to feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay runs.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are just what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled about this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it is simply" "Rental industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships</seg>
<seg id="229">People take part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you travel nowadays, this is compared with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if trips would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be, if in any place you have visited, a group of announcements that would have to be thorough, and to show a bar with a bar, one which has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed based on privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to make apartments from the ground up to the meeting?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of the common?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and separation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South-south of the city of Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces belonging to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"residents were now offered. students, who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were conveyed to people whose children were killed. there were incubatorprograms,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, night 785 000 people in 191 countries are hosted by a foreigner or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel newly.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there was also before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"aside from luck and timing, we noticed that one can find the proper design with the components of the trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-root prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find the astounding;</seg>
<seg id="251">Straight to overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time when a red Mazda goes over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it was able to help us if it had such big influence, I wonder why we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when to watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brainthians, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in safety at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Thus the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, It is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee-owner -- a douter Espresso, with Sahne extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möller-Fitness-Fanatikerage</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, Baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to decide.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person as some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear the hijab, my headgear."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friendships were horrified," "why oppressed you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lustige was: back then it was for me a feminist independence, and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old I felt a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just believed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought after, presented in question, doubted and believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and long devotion to deepened with each reading of the Korans.</seg>

<seg id="289">"I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had to end up breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" "Latest." ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes floats in buildings, people spill out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My lap changed quickly in rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I moved the TV channel and heard:" "Muslim terrorists"..., "..." in the name of Islam... "..."... "..."... "..." "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God. "</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country attacked but in the Nu, the actions of others turned into a suspicious."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start the study program."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I die - when we die, so deeply it went in my seat, and I feared myself that the first time was to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved in this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I saw, and I read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," "be vigilant," "Seid carefully", "" lead in well illuminated areas, "" sampled you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week of it.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a target."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the complete reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who held for Muslims, into the Free, and proposed."</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really brandy on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right now.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people who attacked this country, have attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I shaken the anger of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to have to explain itself to yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">"these are the accusations, which are hard."</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak about my church like a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or good?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour one as a whole and a benign tumor can only be found under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the US body, but a vital organ."</seg>

<seg id="331">"maybe there will be a few parking spaces, but do not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit to a mosque leads to view people of other faith tolerant, and to show greater civil participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicaling process, one has noticed that he can start online. as First, the person is cut off from her church, even by her family, that the extremes is able to kill the true Muslims, and anyone who abhor their behavior and its ideology is a traitor, or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally a group like IS was founded their brutality with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">"as Muslims, as a mother, as a human being, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add to her imagination, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers."</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality which allows them to read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she would preach to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought the silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, they would only bring into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"by nothing inspired and something that had given to their anger, it was a main target for the instrumentalization by the extremists that gave her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam gave the connection to God and its church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"rather than to blame for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept before to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as the Islamophobia and my family are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How affects the 24-hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy based on our thoughts of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear, pass at least three things. "</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian administration system, conformance and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if one has reported the individuals news, in which negative about Muslims have been reported, they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an akademistic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look when the mood against Muslims turn left -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">"it happened in the advance of the Iraq war, and during the two election period."</seg>
<seg id="364">"thus, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to conceive the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>

<seg id="383">"with our son in the Kindersitz we went well, with high pressure on the mosque."</seg>

<seg id="413">"today, we would like to present you some of our new projects."</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of Possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"thus, a system of autonome works, it must be collective admitting where in the room the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamical Tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localised technology of Verity Studios, a offsprings of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"any air-machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations on board, which should do what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands can be found at the highest ece. eg" "start" "and" "land." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called Heckstarter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"an air device, that tries to beat two flies with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in the downward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters, it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">"a restriction of heckstarters is, that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind arches."</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the device doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often introduce basic abstract questions related to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smaller number of moveable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known approximately as machines with a thousand moving parts that work together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"several decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly-controlled air devices that had only two motions: a propeller and a heckruder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"far, we discovered that flies are with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote aircraft. it was invented recently. "</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no clapping, hinges and cross-rests, no further actuator or control rooms, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is simple, happens in the inner life very much, so it can be stable and can move around in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to the fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of throwing it exactly right if all of me, is low, that's why I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospic is a exercise in genuity, this machine is here, the bus copies with its eight propellers, a exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is just symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">"therefore, he is ambivalent in its alignment."</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he gets the proper ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned, or even like it rotating."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propaganda."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things are adjustable in models, the rest will be learned directly at the flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our day, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">These are revolt in the clockwise sense</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they act like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong - a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if it is limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making a half plane.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthesizers.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took negotiable Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and provide them with localised technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit white, where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine that I would like to practice on Broadway a flying lamp.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>

<seg id="466">"it serves as a memory, as wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it is creative, smart grips allowed to form them in the most spectacular way."</seg>

<seg id="477">"since then, the earth has brought a lot: corals, fish, plants, sauce, people and -- God stand for us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group was particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss of MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- to seek a huge laser detector to seek the gravity of the gravitational black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they remembered for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people realized them as crazy genies so the US National Science Foundation have financed their idea.</seg>

<seg id="482">"in follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could be substantially increased, resulting in the recognition performance enormously improved."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, one calls him Advanced LIGO."</seg>
<seg id="484">"early September 2015 LIGO was launched for a final test run, in order to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>

<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves is extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us were stretched in the waves of the waves, and expanded. the stretching of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 Nulls after the comma, followed by a 1st intestine, we explained the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousands of the radius of an atomic nuclear. that's grotesque."</seg>

<seg id="503">"but physicists are finalised, and with the support of the general public all the obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott holds pleasure, LIGO is more than one ear as one eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial lifts, the size of your hand."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because so you can create an image or a map of things by taking the light of the coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With foolish is that different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult to make a picture of things, which mean to you especially much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child is approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties such as sound, rhythm and volume, rhythm and volume, in order to close to the story behind it."</seg>

<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can no simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by changing changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">"at least, for LIGO the reported frequencies are in the audible area."</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave-muster in scall, we can literally listen to the all."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation of laughing, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-turning holes, circulating simply: wupp! "</seg>

<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement, shaped to the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date which at least I never forget -- heard LIGO Folder: [Surrenderusch] Jemand, who knows what he has to hear, see this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which is about as fast as the sticks of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: thinking about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns that others with a mass of 36 suns that revolve hundreds of times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the constant significance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">"LIGO opens up a completely new way to study the alls, as it has never been possible before."</seg>
<seg id="534">This is the way we can listen to the universe and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can see -- virtually or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a Supernova, for example. I would like to know why masked stars in Supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes occur but at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers from iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the urbang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the judgment is shining through its own image."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravity shafts, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">And that is most important: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen before that we have never seen before and of which we have no idea what we can only discover by hearing.</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found right in the first leg of things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this subject: me: the type of stars, which rise black holes, such as LIGO she observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the sauce for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO gives us a completely different perspective on the events of all, the emergence of the stars, and finally on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sound and pantelopes of the cosmos."</seg>

<seg id="567">"yes," I changed. "</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain thing that my life was deeply changed, on an unexpectancy. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for inexplicable reasons all" kitties, "</seg>

<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"of a new attitude towards my family. from there I swear to play with them, as soon as you go on. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"fast. I am not perfect, but I am trying very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an intriguing side effect: only in short, I actually understood that the" "Yes" "was saved to play with my children my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things off you wake up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I generate television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style. "</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"each program provides hundreds of jobs, which previously did not exist."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days of four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series will run on Thursday nights.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world I run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of this 70 TV-hours are broadcasts, which I myself created, and not just produced, so still obendlessly. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the bonfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still making?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you, so all of you who work so hard if you now speak a company, a country or a household, so I understand that I'm not just talking on the computer and I say, I realize that there is no dreaming in a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I have absorbed into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set troops on, when I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"so as portraits, you get a high tone, provided a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could always go on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I tell them the buzz, that I persuaded writing that writing me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, this does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buck -- when I started working with television production, when I began to work and work, build, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums of action is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums of music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have so much sums, then you can not strive for size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling, not to be different than seek size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what you call the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I'm not for failure, and I just know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I do not want to ask it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things the more things the more watching me, the more I write history, all the more expectations there."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to succeed, the more you have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, which I created, the marathon, which I walk, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stops the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, exaggerated, exaggerated, burned down."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single working nobility.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," Behold, I want to go to Shonda Country. "</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the buzz heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="650">I no longer loved my job. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as usual: the same Titans-work, 15 hours-days, performed weekends, no repentment, nothing delegate, a Titan Sleep does not exist, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was an interview-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what are you doing, if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "Heul you from, blöder author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you have to love what you do, one banker to be a banker, a painter, Bill Gates know if you knew the buzz, when you didn't know the sums you do, who is one then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart is listening, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I put my "southern states waitress" a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to the outside, late so that she says:" "Mama, you are playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I want to say no, than two things will be aware of:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "kitties."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan I and my sums have betray, and here everything is changing my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mama, you are playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">That is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "Everybody Poops". ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude, and in the absence of the sum, I can do nothing except to fit."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I created, the marathon, which I walk, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax glands and the song, in which it comes to release, or whatever the girl in" The Iron Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so little that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">The opposite is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes down and an energy drive comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain at the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. this is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working environment, the Titanensummen, this is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I'm telling you who I am when I describe myself with broadcasts and TV-hours, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the current that comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Genuine sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the pressure of history, which did go to running tasks, the anticipation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps escaped me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan I?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no other option if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I am not good at playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"playing, I do not lie in any way as working."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurting</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I preferred to work at the workplace as a home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"concession is painful, because what kind of man works rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"time honest, I call myself" "Titan" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden around, ahead and back."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crashes soap-bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent, and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I am always looking for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe met me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ended with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! tell them always yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naïve for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">"then you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at a maximum of 15 minutes, until they stables that they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a badminetle or Keks replaced me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teenage girl all 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more needs it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">"each can bring 15 minutes at a piece, even on a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my welfare, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is to feel the buzz to have a place for his soul lovers."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it is not about playing with their own children. it is about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">About the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I scissors and I victories. friends meet, reading books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" "stands just for everything I got up when I got my first TV show, when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to make myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why not full 15 minutes treat? "</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months opens up a door, the energy flows in, and I find myself in my office. I hear a unknown melody, she met me and my soul. she crossed me to new ideas. I don't use it to new ideas and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz I do not... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap-bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The buzz of the work is part of me but just a part. and for this I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is a snap that I am a Titan I. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clear my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buck. the country, which I gained, the marathon, the canvases, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buck, the more this unusual, beatiful, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things I awake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said Yes "to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titles have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want you play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a severe stroke or a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgery, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a constant, heavy handicap."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I have been surgical neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the most famous one of the" "woody stimulation". "it implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons so that neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, which suffered severe trembling and heavy pain. "</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading Oberstine and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often found patients with skull-shepherd-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that in skull-brain traumas shears the brain and the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life is diminishing the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, you sometimes have to remove a part of squared brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the brained brain mass, we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let cells grow from a tissue, is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it made Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw he under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with great green cells, surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the Biology lessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. you are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal tribal cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were divided slowly and after a few weeks she even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but it was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">You come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublecorine-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our large-hirririnse cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they ensure the funeral of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay it to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find it close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear however - of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, which allows brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">This was what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to see a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in the same way as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">"and they then highlight colored, in order to be able to pursue them in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimded it at the deflestal of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we provoke these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we provoke the same cells into braised brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we lost the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely dised after a few weeks as if they were taken away, they go back home. the room is already occupied, so they will not disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation of and reimplant exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they sailed to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have ripened.</seg>
<seg id="862">"evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells, which we are in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual workbook.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take forpellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable dexterment level we have achieved in the motor cortex cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move her hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in people, she recovered spontaneous up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastificated brain mechanisms. they go to a certain degree, just as with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implant his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left you will see the monkey, which is spontaneously recovered."</seg>
<seg id="874">He can bring about 40% to 50% of his original power from violation.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, see, when we draw the cells of reimapped: the same monkey, two months after the plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">"however, our dream is still to implant them in humans."</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne that is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who need this. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I am definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on people."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time to have a lot of patience and a professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have finished research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies. if you continue to look forward to the future, how many years it takes to come to hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multicentralized study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment any time.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the disruptive plant that is in reality, but as a inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable stubborn.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great repatrists in Beijing have undoubtedly proven that it is quite possible to thriving a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy comes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous as a finance minister in Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not likely to influence the austerity programmes that were implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my critic friends told me that democracy would be abolished when they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup in a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are mixed, our future düster and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point out you on an interesting contradiction - the currently our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin summit" "paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the school-mountain, who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the school-mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is considered to be anxious, however, where it would be productive, where it would be productive and incomes to bring, with which you need to bring the debt of debt and also all the things that humanity urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months have been invested in the U.S., in England and the Eurozone, in all the prosperity producing goods, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion dollars sounds like a lot of money, until it compares with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which had at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing about the borrowing and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital make up the twin summit, which cannot be distinguished by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the results are stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54 year old in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently, a low economic demand that would not invest in which they could not invest. just like oils, the prophecy of the organ might be true that his son would kill him if he grows,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unaware of the circumstances, guiding the circumstances that oils are killing him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely venerable Art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe already. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy closed off course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to underminate the significance of the athic democracy due to these proportions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor of the Athenian democracy was and is that they were involved in the working arms, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive is to them the right to political codetermination in questions of the cousins."</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenian democracy has not been held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which is very light illuminated, it is also quickly expanded."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for the ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy came only until now, as a complete separation from politics and economics, and the democratic process has been incorporated into politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations have been a more democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our today's democracies since the time, in which this separation of politics and business began, a relentless struggle between the two, and the economy gradually emigrated to politics."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians have no more so than before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is the fact that one can still be in the government today, and yet it is not at power because the power of politics cannot be separated into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hadern with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a flock of robbery, which so lasting the animals, of which they are nourished, decimated, that they are at the end of that."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that grows so far beyond the self-caused economic crisis. the power of corporations grows, political goods are cancelled, economic demand falls, and the managing director of corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their firms."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism the" Demos "[the people] out of democracy, the higher the twins, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that's true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy back, and it would be better if the" Demos "control, thus, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, the women and the foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't really good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching from the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be, that the working poor is regained only by a miracle, as in the ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Niedrigloomy employed by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, automating the twin summit, the wastage of habitable, and social conflicts deeper, just as I think -- as soon as I think -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must reconnect the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and in doing so, we end the reunified field of democracy, otherwise we end the movie" matrix "like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"therefore, the question is not whether capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements he will survive."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to the" "Star Trek", "similar to the" "Star Trek", "in which machinery will serve the people and put people into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">"I believe, we must be optimistic."</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what bris it, how could it look like this" star Trek "-like utopia rather than the" "matrix" "similar dystia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I would like to introduce you, in all brief, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies, please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital is working to you from a job to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all income from capital and dissolve and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but do not work in it, and workers who work there; no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and spar, and ultimately no empowering twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please briefly face that our national currencies would have freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 biggest Emerging Markets] is present in the interest of all mankind."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the overall world trade is traded in this currency -- call it" "cosmos", "in units of" cosmos "" -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the merchant of the respective country to a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment resources."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one did not realise the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in the context of a reunited policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe you is at the same time liberally, in which they favored privileged people, and Marxian because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the Mülmen's history, and keynesian, globally keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Are we awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"or are we in a" "matrix" "- similar dystack teeth?"</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we work together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography yourself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunion of politics and economy is... do we do that, technological development will produce a massive decline in economic demand, which Larry Summers is called" term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we're currently experiencing it, it will not only be our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberational democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, therefore I am a libertarian Marxist and how Keynes, and therefore I am also fully equipped."</seg>

<seg id="988">"YV: if you are not wirr, you do not think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your presentation mentioned Singapore and China, and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you think of the view of the West on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of the deplays, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, when I must say this provocative, China resembles that today the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake that is historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">"he was particularly skeptical, which concerns the democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can now observe in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now seems to do that, what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure many listeners are curious about your experiences as a finance minister from the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I know that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back to the first half months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to catch a new one with the euro zone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely we say goodbye to self-sufficiency, and the perpetual denial of the eurozone was carried out, and continues to substantially reduce the development of the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek accusation -- by the way, the first proposal was to open the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately it is right to do. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone is elected within the European group, continuing the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"but you know, what comes."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable, due to political will and authoritarianism it will be able to delay in a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>

<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister there, after 6 months in office, especially in such tense situation, he made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"I believed that there was an honest interest on the pages of the donors, finding a common solution."</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price did most have never heard, even though he is probably responsible for 22 medium-sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is conductors of Amazon Studios;</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slender, has a long-term and describes himself on Twitter as" "Films, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for making the shows and the content that they will produce Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought branch."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy may not select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right at this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this turn is the evaluation distribution of more than 2,500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows can get this review."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"when your show is rated nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" breaking bath, "" Game of Thrones, "" The wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after going to have a season, your brain asks:" "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you what goes on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence to be" "Toddlers and Tiaras". ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average expression, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, that's why Roy wants to risk nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses with a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can see each free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon becomes free for free things, it is attacking right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who will receive everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"when you collect, when to start the show when you are paused, which parts you skips or again look."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"they collect millions of data to determine with these data, which show them should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and from it arises the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four Republican U.S. senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Do someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of that curve 7,4 is and Alpha House launches on average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find out a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team have shown the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use these data to find out these little details about the spectators: what shows they like what producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had together all the parts, they went a car and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has suffered a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "receives a 9,1 rating on this corner. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"it has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collects millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should be able to make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You can optimise it through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"that is what you can expect, is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis is not working, then this is a bit frightening because we live in a time in which we have more and more to take statistics in order to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone know the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no. OK, this is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this space ever comes into touch with this software. come in touch with this, you are in prison. "</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in the United States and for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether an dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, which can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite of the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">This is not always the best results created. this is not the fact that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most diversified companies are even wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can be predicted by data analysis outbreaks of flu, the limb way, predictions - by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success was introduced in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year round by year until it is suddenly no longer functional,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the most diversified companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors influx in decisions made by life a -- on the workplace, in the dispute, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people unthinkable many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or developing a drug. over the years I have recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you have to solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as the First enter this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as a second, you set the items again to summarise a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you need to do this several times, but there are always two things to take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all possess it: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that the brain is good, it is parts and pieces come together again, even if the information is incomplete, so if the information is incomplete, especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe I was Netflix so successful because they used data and mind where they are also in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, why not they would have been able to understand all these parts, and make it a show like" House of Cards "," that does not stand up in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision. "</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions first than they have broadcasted around TV-ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a Show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they were able to say: "we say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data are starting to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and not to forget that this device is pretty useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Jae- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most probably" -- exactly here in this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will get it later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions made in my life so that I should have heard in the ball on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a lot of way to make data analysis in order to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in this way, perhaps the ball will be clumsy and cleverly. ultimately it is possible to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging message that, despite the large amount of data still pays off, choices to meet, an expert in what you are doing and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
