Munich 1856 : four cards that will change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt where young people should meet today .
&quot; a se@@ pul@@ ls , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tun@@ er will be excav@@ ated . &quot;
small @-@ gar@@ dener tend to provide the cause of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich encourages exciting stories to spend days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; everyone knows everyone who had to rain himself already , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i was taking place in a radius street instead of a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but currently - but therefore very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially when one compar@@ es them with current online cards .
&quot; then clearly , the cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Mer@@ cury has changed since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a mak@@ es@@ try I see as such is not equal .
&quot; in the big review card were made for cities and municipalities for more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; prim@@ acy sheets , &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these emerged according to the Bay@@ er@@ mination administration administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and decre@@ asing the first Ver@@ messung of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French He@@ er@@ leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ of War with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria to order - naturally for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops arrived with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neighbours that created the idea of a surface @-@ covered Bavaria card . &quot;
&quot; Max I@@ V. Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the &quot; &quot; top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische entic@@ ements . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional blatt for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bav@@ arian Library .
the comparison of the morning / Today is the case of the state capital .
the city has grown into all directions and has grown up .
an example of this is sub@@ ver@@ ling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated .
&quot; Send@@ ling was published 21 years after creation of the map , so 1877 , as a Mün@@ ch@@ ner district . &quot;
today sub@@ ver@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ dl@@ ings are located at 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insurrection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when Hin@@ einz@@ o@@ oms appears a smaller map with do@@ zens of do@@ zens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; out of which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small plots do not occupy there today no farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in the Sun . &quot;
a large green space is characterized north of sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 show@@ room of the October Revolution , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century . &quot;
on the other side of Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the field of the residence A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen is not only reads the road name &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ straße , one once used people with ins@@ anity . &quot;
&quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden the furnishings - that of the psy@@ chi@@ ater , which is associated with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the Ank@@ hing of the so called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; in addition , he is not allowed to use the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged in an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients there was first place , later was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity is no longer a result - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ sts in Germany . &quot;
on the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt meet young people in Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the medal er@@ war@@ b built the building complex 1920 and turned him into a youth @-@ home with training .
&quot; west is the football field of the T@@ SV Munich east , east of the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; was prepared for the children of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt during World War II during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was at 1856 as &quot; &quot; Head &quot; , &quot; the purchase street was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change took place during the Second World War too .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies ris@@ sen in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city center .
a great remained until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the English institute , small business buildings and a se@@ pul@@ ls from the Middle Ages was once at the Marien@@ hof , where these days will work and take place on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ ade for the second S @-@ Bahn . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich card can be compared to the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marien@@ hof . &quot;
Citiz@@ enship group publ@@ ishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of coloured states has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is scheduled to enter into force by the state , demanding A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ aner , as a number of ques@@ tioning , racial cases occur in the whole state and here , it is stated in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder to win discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ ution bodies of the State , the dis@@ proportionate to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to raise the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that happen to men .
&quot; they are hal@@ ted for their skin colour , they are assembled or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ansas City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear discomfort in such an incidence , which we have not yet heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group quoted inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist arrest against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in fragile circumstances beginning of the year after having no gas@@ oline &apos;s journey through the state , and was taken into custo@@ dy by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by Mis@@ sour@@ i Office , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people have to be ready to bring Cau@@ tion @-@ money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
Mis@@ sour@@ i signed up in 2015 100 Hass@@ an in 2015 according to the latest numbers from the Hass@@ en@@ bre@@ w reporting program of the F@@ BI that defines the state with regard to the number of such violations at the 16th place of the country .
&quot; travelling is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it harder to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union had issued before the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) , after the states of immigration laws passed , people to mig@@ rate because of immigration law , which will contribute to the view of AC@@ ES to further r@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but in the last time interest groups has been used as a reaction to specific laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
past@@ ure project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary Peter White and Kor@@ du@@ la K@@ ovac started a picture on site .
&quot; at the right @-@ grab@@ enhof of the family Schwen@@ de@@ mann met representatives of the fisher@@ man CD@@ U town , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann gave first insights into its operation , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and also houses many kitt@@ ens and houses in five apartments Ferien@@ ga@@ este . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; black milk &quot; &quot; is for him the altern@@ ate mark@@ eter way for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively region@@ ales .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ H@@ V Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he marked the Wei@@ dener project as &quot; &quot; elementary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I cannot act on such a steep land .
&quot; the green surface for a lot of work , a lot of nuts will be dealt with with the Motor@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; we have been here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the el@@ ic@@ able operation and managed this without chemical @-@ based pesti@@ cides and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it does not lead to bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the importance of the White project , and is pleased with the Leader of the leaders . &quot;
&quot; at the expense of 3000 to 4000 Euro per h@@ ect@@ are , farmers must be supported . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the for@@ estation of the areas could be pushed aside for quite a while . &quot;
&quot; the biggest treasure that we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot;
farmers are often standing in criticism due to promotion
more than 25 plots were fenced in 2013 by eleven participants in 2013 .
&quot; the entertainment surface is 40 hectares , which can be kept up to at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 Euro , half of the leader was being promoted , a quarter contributed to the community of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers hi@@ ring 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of wheat . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; stated Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Kor@@ du@@ la K@@ ovac said : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ lords , it does not go . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter White stood : &quot; &quot; here best food produced . &quot;
the Land@@ sc@@ ans ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of past@@ ors .
the aim is the disclosure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
prerequ@@ is@@ ites is the presence of one of the L@@ PR signed .
&quot; in addition , the fence should not be sl@@ ed@@ itable ( Hang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ man &apos;s ordination project , 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the entertainment surface is equivalent to 35 hectares , the cold costs are more than 112 000 Euros . &quot;
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime transfer is to carry out the statues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the restoration of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly what he did when he took a symbolic struggle by Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the president to the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller handle not the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators could have suffered it if he had done it .
&quot; but he laid their significance , and in particular the meaning that you have been written when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta im@@ min@@ ed : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that glo@@ ws the world . &quot;
the poem on which you refer to that later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is properly capable of properly , but as he formed it itself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the emerging words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your exhausted , your poor , / your be@@ dr@@ ang@@ ed crowds , who longing for after@@ ward to breathe free from the el@@ ding waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time , in which the &quot; miserable waste &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot;
Miller did not get involved in liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after her death on the basis - did so good that they have accomplished a high @-@ political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republi@@ can@@ ism by portr@@ ayed the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminine cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed , the people of the right wing wanted to switch it long for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great Schrei@@ er Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of Johannes of the Illusion for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is nobody lon@@ ged , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame into the um@@ ph@@ ed world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes ahead . &quot;
it is intended to bear the tor@@ ches of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something stolen .
the significance of the statue is quite and at all a question of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted to see them as they were of the exhaus@@ tive , miserable , but hop@@ eful humans after long and often terrible travel to the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people , seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tru@@ mp will ever recognise . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hat@@ red , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ ides Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle rec@@ alls itself at a time when only two vill@@ i had belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member accounts will be a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland a little special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom have to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the corner .
whatever the combination of the circumstances is absolutely brilliant .
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes have medals there , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - that will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected from the team to the team &apos;s team . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is rather modest .
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feel , the E@@ ili@@ dh naturally brought forth , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth @-@ Silver medal winner , who is playing at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 r@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes on the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the middle @-@ cycle @-@ runners Mu@@ ir leads to this path and has five British and two European recru@@ its last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5.000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another shot , which you should look after a great season , which was included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ yle rec@@ alls itself at its first world Championships , when the only other fl@@ otto in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was . &quot;
&quot; the teams leaders say that they are &quot; huge &quot; of the fact that many of their land men are not only part of the team , but in some cases even with the medals and with the fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; the special thing to be in this team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor to know that my team mates voted for me and have chosen me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we got .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to rise to Po@@ dia . &quot;
what my speech concerns as a captain in particular ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
&quot; I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship . &quot;
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympi@@ astadi@@ on .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it &apos;s going to be a great atmosphere out there .
blocking of critics about Facebook : Be@@ wir@@ b does not block you to take a public office when you cannot wear the heating of voters .
the father of our country knew a bit of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t last long until the newspapers sw@@ allow him because of all , from domestic policy to its political principles . &quot;
he shi@@ pped in criticism , safe . &quot;
but he did not bring his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; the speech of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we will be guided like the sheep to the s@@ laughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work on how Washington must be . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ endant him this beginning of this week .
&quot; the st@@ ab of the Gover@@ nor did the law@@ suit was called fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a return campaign with &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a Republi@@ can governor in a stunning democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the highest approval of the 50 Govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary H@@ itz@@ ring .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his State and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with its elec@@ tors and playing his ha@@ ired head after chemotherapy on its side .
&quot; therefore , the rec@@ ti@@ ation of individuals who come to the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ ll@@ es or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ amm@@ able people , who vibr@@ ate online the P@@ eit@@ sche . &quot;
the mail spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a busin@@ es@@ sman and a pastor , not tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments are respectful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ited . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyers at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked to break Hass@@ an . &quot;
&quot; I commented polite , that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , she wrote in the commentary box of the message &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a collective collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the associates of the Gover@@ nor was &quot; &quot; focused spam attack &quot; , &quot; other probably would be called &quot; &quot; provi@@ denti@@ als &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to he@@ ap a message by blocking a critics or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , when you have done the same that employees were dispos@@ ed to collect newspapers with critical control , and to burn or prot@@ esters and to silence . &quot;
but that is exactly what is happening .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is min@@ ted by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell to Virginia last week .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ as , the last A@@ mend@@ ment of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , the last A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they registered a voters from their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ LU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so heavy .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous let@@ tering on his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; petition that critic@@ ise his position on the contract of am@@ ity , the trade and navigation of the UK cri@@ tici@@ zed his office , according to the historical documents , which were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not lead them to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and disco@@ urses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept .
Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
&quot; the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty will hope in the next three days , since the Renaissance club will be held in East Lot@@ hi@@ an , 25 edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , which occurred next year at the Ar@@ cher@@ field links until the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new venue , as a tournament ban on behalf of the Association of the Association and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved with this event , &quot; said Raf@@ fer@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he fixed this place .
he is an eager advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ anders E@@ ales is looking forward to a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly true , &quot; said the player in South@@ port heated player . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as it was in the year , after I had won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r who came back to the European Senior Tour early this year to return home promotion .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel these additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
glad how far it has been .
&quot; with the trio at the field , the former Masters @-@ winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six guns on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the car park costs £ 5 per car with an inn@@ amon and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds will go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pneum@@ onia through passive exposure
in the last two decades fewer people have died due to passive lung cancer .
this results will be scientists of the university hospital in Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates are attributed per year 167 lung cancer accidents on passive exposure , &quot; said cur@@ rant Hei@@ ko B@@ echer . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved to this subject in 1994 . &quot;
at that time there are still 400 lung cancer cases because of passive smoke per year in Germany .

house connections will prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; lie reasonably at the time , &quot; says the head of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the field of household sections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground much w@@ ess , which is not seen in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which always hin@@ ders construction work again , represents a major problem for the Bau@@ tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the mot@@ orists in front of red lights and lock@@ ers is already huge , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the buses are entitled to access .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been busy with working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were very nice , exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina Deg@@ ree the dinner coo@@ ks , she uses no stove . &quot;
it even use rarely a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the in@@ quiet in@@ don@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually lists a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
after half an hour the fo@@ al lob@@ ster will be taken with cold @-@ eag@@ erly ed hands and sm@@ elled .
Deg@@ ree is sitting on the lo@@ ol@@ ism - she has no furniture - where it also performs their daily work such as clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of their man they were not assigned to fields .
Poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late at work can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there is the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody we@@ ars it after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was founded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 El@@ ders should vote before the occupation forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , applied for independence against the Dutch rule turned down quickly against the Government of Jak@@ arta , which holds control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or juris@@ dictions . &quot;
in 2003 the province became officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour car with the car .
there are no public transport .
&quot; the city with approximately 19.@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo , and from cor@@ rug@@ ated ro@@ oft@@ ops , which were converted by r@@ ust into different yellow @-@ brown plates . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esian made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , the Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says Deg@@ ree and points on their lively , handy tur@@ ban , her dar@@ kl@@ es Hem@@ d and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indon@@ esian Province where 28 % of people are living under the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ alli@@ zation and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine in the world , grass @-@ mountain , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a strongh@@ old in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has declined in the value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollar gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources in value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these rich@@ es are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indon@@ esian military has preserved a refreshing presence . &quot;
&quot; an examination from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort will pay local anth@@ ill relatives and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ ua &apos;s demands after greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden g@@ ans and are treated in grace .
&quot; according to information from activists , more than 500,000 papers have been killed and thousands have been tor@@ tured by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 . &quot;
Mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal hoch@@ land in the 1970 @-@ 1970s were conducted in compliance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone the Indon@@ esian police have more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we do this all , in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ bane from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are , such as un@@ law@@ ful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular , and brutal ra@@ inf@@ all protests . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week is happening , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have been reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources have a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % christ@@ mas , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing , since Muslim economies are populated by the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ anese War@@ ning @-@ Kant@@ inen @-@ sell chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a brick vegetables served with pe@@ ppers . &quot;
local people are struggling to collaborate here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ detached , who went to work in the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has the native pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market costs .
&quot; the Indon@@ esian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the folk and Jo@@ kow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jo@@ kow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point in October only two months after Jo@@ kow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas lie@@ der in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness . &quot;
the sho@@ cking children told them that they should stop their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took the impetus at their sound , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , who had dr@@ unk , j@@ agu@@ ed , and sm@@ ote the group with their hon@@ ors , said sacrific@@ es and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , became so heavy that he fell into the coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was set in fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Committee for Justice . &quot;
they carried red hunting ar@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle regularly and a bird @-@ hau@@ ling - of Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started to sl@@ ate stones on police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was up@@ lifted up , the soldiers were sent more than three times by the soldiers : &quot; &quot; when the masses res@@ ist more than three times by the masses , they shoot it dead , &quot; it says in an official document of T@@ IME that has not been released the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the risk of danger and called for peace and called for the amount to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned myself , I suddenly got into my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said T@@ IME on the porch of his colorful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who has strengthened , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were strengthened , &quot; &quot; adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the sho@@ ots was . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and under@@ sought his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who has as many Indon@@ esian only one name , the T@@ IME in d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the che@@ ering spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said re@@ por@@ ters that his officers wanted to secure their station &quot; &quot; because they will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten us to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others wo@@ unded . &quot;
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings came only the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks ago Jo@@ kow@@ i held a passionate talk in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he sympath@@ ies sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ or , the historic ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be resolved right away , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; security Mr. Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he entered a non @-@ judicial mechanism for laying historic human rights violations . &quot;
but the talk began almost immediately .
&quot; most injury have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must go through . &quot;
&quot; then S@@ anto made an retreat when he spoke on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with T@@ IME and said , he had no plans to set a complaint in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the Wir@@ anto , which was indic@@ ted for crimes against humanity because of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua was already being attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ victims are contrary to such alleg@@ ations of gri@@ ff@@ ness .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I fear , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid of being arrested by the military , I will be afraid . &quot;
&quot; his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated that people in panic fear , to discuss the incident . &quot;
&quot; he says that he was be@@ aten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting are not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; while a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refuse to bring a mind @-@ free man into hospital , died a person and 17 others were viol@@ ated , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he was caught in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
Ascen@@ ded vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the location office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers stones were on officers , who re@@ acted upon it by war@@ nings . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( in@@ don@@ esian param@@ il@@ it@@ ary police ) began to shoot the amount and a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness was , like the last here was quickly supplied , so the T@@ IME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to withdraw the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police in the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an Un@@ ru@@ h@@ eh@@ er@@ d for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bal nation@@ als Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , which live in the green Highlands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebellion which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by stopping spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of in@@ don@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to these years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , under the pre@@ text of securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &apos; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty rein@@ forces the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the bit rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as a range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and vegetables and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a precious only 10,000 Indon@@ esian R@@ up@@ ies ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities has grown between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants that have arrived at the airport of Nab@@ ire in larger numbers . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better trained and prosp@@ erous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary ability to guide their own business competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Executive Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on international media are tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ ll Long@@ ch@@ amp was ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission to the film was given . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jo@@ kow@@ is election campaign to lift the restrictions of the coverage in order to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esian in the most tranquil provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in March , six Pacific States - Tong@@ a , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen islands - the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; diverse and widespread injury &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai &apos;s shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian State Department Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still holds a democratic system and there are free media , so it is difficult to waste the evidence for human rights accidents . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , conducted under the direction of the human right amb@@ assador K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4th May visited , bra@@ ised their silence and liber@@ ated him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also wants to participate in the meeting , but will remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably will not be able to vote again for Jo@@ kow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ kow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is involved by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ eme , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the President of the Chief Executive Board . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jo@@ kow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ people knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ People lives , apart from that it is living under the constant threat of a pure military army , in alarm and health services . &quot;
G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people like other pap@@ ua to consider her voice for Jo@@ kow@@ i as a &quot; guilt that he has to pay .
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ i led a last symbolic act of f@@ ool : the cor@@ pse of an offering was buried on a terrain just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that maybe they will never come to justice , but at least let them do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with soci@@ able head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &quot; Tor@@ ch &quot; sky@@ scrapers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai his book and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ stor@@ ey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that took place in just two years through the sky@@ scr@@ aper , which is to be acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evac@@ u@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept in , and we got up in the fire alarm and for the scre@@ ams of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran@@ ged the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; told a resident who has his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ishing and the building cooled .
&quot; the government said , they work on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot;
&quot; incident may have questions about the safety of materials , which are used in external areas of sky@@ scrapers around the world . &quot;
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after whose fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damages from the cl@@ adding , the outside cl@@ adding to the decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police , they believe that the system of plates to insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell @-@ Tower in June was led to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ ch in June , with which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : continue Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through the General Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the Ho @-@ Chi @-@ Min@@ h City meeting was supported for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single only on two winn@@ ings , Hau@@ ch@@ thin@@ ly supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; that is often very long , but also very estimated Five @-@ sentence @-@ classics remain the tradition of tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , was therefore just almost absent . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership would not have accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change in order to ensure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historic competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
they will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not only until the vote was before the proposal before that the proposal reached , the finals on a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : this will be the Fin@@ alist in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup future in future , in the first round the host law will have . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the cost of organis@@ ers , the requirements placed in terms of training sets etc. and players will need to complete the Davis Cup less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US travellers , there is a survey of objects in the airplane , finds a survey . &quot;
&quot; a survey among passengers found that more than 20 percent are conscious or un@@ aware objects to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which em@@ ishes the plane while being acci@@ dentally com@@ promised knife or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent asser@@ ted , they would have been del@@ ayed that they have traveled er@@ ron@@ eous with fire@@ arms , am@@ muni@@ tion or explosive . &quot;
&quot; the survey with more than 1,000 people - provided by a jet charter service , the STR@@ ATOS Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger travellers are more likely to abuse the rules . &quot;
&quot; from the respon@@ dents said that they kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19,@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common objects , which have been prov@@ oked by T@@ SA agents , were food and liqui@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent , kno@@ w@@ ingly have driven items with blades by the safety check , while 2,@@ 2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of male respon@@ dents were also confirmed that they would be inten@@ tionally reported war@@ med drugs into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , it has asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gled up by the airport security and how many it could have done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that men , the most sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers - kno@@ w@@ ingly or in@@ wis@@ ely - by the safety wearing those who were most common . &quot;
&quot; however , the company pointed out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uns@@ ure which liqui@@ ds are allowed to take them or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items made by the T@@ SA are conf@@ isc@@ ated items .
&quot; a time long thought the people , the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la &apos;s clients
electric @-@ thous@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k has a huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far he has under@@ estimated that a part of the customers had already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in addition to the continually tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s numbers , and even gigantic sales aim , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has given the first time a different , lesser @-@ lac@@ ed number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k has often advertis@@ ed more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k ks : from a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have been drawn up to 63.@@ 000 . &quot;
critics were repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; for cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 euros ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) . &quot;
&quot; at present , 45@@ 5.000 of such un@@ binding reservations before , spatial Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ al@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la Chef does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered . &quot;
&quot; 2018 - all models are assembled - 500,000 , by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is evident .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; should be reck@@ oned in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , nor even in practice tested production roads without greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum exposure . &quot;
many experts are doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to larger delays , then the non @-@ binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not prevent un@@ satisfied customers from there , in gravel . &quot;
&quot; EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt refers to the rules of Obama &apos;s delays to reduce emissions . &quot;
&quot; a day after he had been lam@@ ented by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authorities , his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g par@@ ables . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as its agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities to react more quickly than previous administrator .
he did not mentioned the law@@ suit against his previous place in a German occupation court .
&quot; it is a deadline , running on 1 October for States , in order to adhere to the standards of 2015 for ground @-@ down oz@@ on . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt proclaimed in June , that he will delay the adher@@ ence to a year to study the plan more time , to study the plan and to prevent growth in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent in the field of environmental protection rules for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington P@@ ru@@ itt repeatedly had to block , blocking or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the cut of regulatory roll@@ out agenda .
&quot; last month , a German career court in Washington decided that the EPA administration has exceeded its authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas company to monitor and reduce meth@@ an@@ lec@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; in one on Wednesday &apos;s opinion , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his turn@@ around at o@@ zone standards simply hit the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states by the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under earlier administr@@ ations , the EPA often did not viol@@ ate the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to put an appointment for the implementation of activists , and agreed upon an agreement to prepare for the implementation , &quot; he said P@@ ru@@ itt , who mo@@ ur@@ ned the EPA more than a dozen time in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by juris@@ dictions , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority that there are us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA approved by EPA have at some point his &quot; authority &quot; to delay and all others are legally available to ensure that the rules on a solid policy and the best available information is based . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a wider new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month by 2015 should delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet provided in the Senate .
&quot; the New York State General Manager , Eric Tro@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states , who promised the EPA in this week , the group said that the group intend to maintain statutory print . &quot;
&quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - after our charges - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , who is in their communities . &quot;
&quot; new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , Rho@@ de Island , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; o@@ zone is created when toxic substances from cars , power plants , o@@ il@@ stores , chemical refined , chemical systems and other sources in the atmosphere on sunlight . &quot;
the smo@@ g smo@@ g can result in sensitive groups of people serious breathing problems and every year will contribute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alist che@@ ered on a surprising change of course .
&quot; it is worrying about how much pressure it takes to receive this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air we receive , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government , addressing environmental pollution and their specific interests . &quot;

&quot; the newly created bell rack , then for the first time in 16@@ 92 , had to be released later during World War II in 1942 . &quot;

society wants to test permission of Win@@ dr@@ yers
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is looking at no legal condition for the construction , and therefore has turned into the country . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; hon@@ ors &quot; has promp@@ ted Andreas Co@@ ated ( CD@@ U ) to res@@ ist his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval of 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the edge @-@ border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal have existed . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible at the same time causes the concentration of wind power for the rest of the region . &quot;
these zones should avoid a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; a few days before , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change a second wind turbine zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but had not approved the district government Düsseldorf , because of a form@@ ulate . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the declared approval of author@@ is@@ cation will remain un@@ law@@ ful and therefore also raise it , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; hon@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; current status of things : the council entered again the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , a permit of the district government is still standing . &quot;
&quot; kens : &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a licence for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the challenge .
&quot; the corresponding writing have been given in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes it on occasion to check the matter again .
but they do not expect that the procedure will be stopped .
&quot; with a view on ongoing proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle of Thursday did not want to speak to the reason@@ ing of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on a surface at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , construction of four per 200 meters high wind . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , where the city of Vier@@ sen was involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen is involved , pl@@ edged contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of large bank@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of four wind turbines , the electricity demand is due to be covered by around 11 400 households - this is equivalent to approximately one @-@ fifth of all four thousand households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sens gave green light to buy three wind turbines in Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen and a stake in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ acks together : woman dies at an aw@@ ful accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday afternoon at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and B@@ ecke ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn district ) .
a woman was fatal .
two more people have been slightly in@@ ju@@ red .
the country road stayed for hours locked .
&quot; according to police , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch went out with her car as part of the accompanying ride with her 53 @-@ year mother as a companion to the L 333 in direction . &quot;
town and dealers plan &quot; home @-@ sh@@ oppen &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city in September .
&quot; the Commercial Association and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th of September , to attract the residents to the shopping mile in the city center . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the profession , Christian King , announced the &quot; &quot; home @-@ sh@@ oppen &quot; &quot; weekend the clients seeks to raise awareness of what offers the own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional vendors is expected to be similar to the weekend market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city should be inviting . &quot;
the promotion of this promotion is not only on inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an Internet video and printed bag , which refer to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian King . &quot;
municipal management and commercial organisation cooperate with the industrial and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; thus the commercial center and the city enter into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest and sold @-@ selling Sunday , conversations with all the commercial l@@ ending and hosts to move it to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and reference to parking fees in this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential new or again should be used again . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals have lost the city shopping at shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ate the city center - to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it was to overcome with a network of overcoming the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , who made themselves globally , King had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stri@@ ch , leader of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen divided to participate in the nation@@ wide third &quot; &quot; home @-@ sh@@ oppen &quot; &quot; day , for the first time in five Thür@@ inger cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ ligh@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day &quot; &quot; meant &quot; &quot; for the esteem of local trade and spread its significance for the common good of our cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign led by the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also make it clear that every citizen can be influenced with his purchase environment .
two dead and several wo@@ unded after explosion at US school
&quot; during construction , there was a gas stove in the school building . &quot;
new people have been in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; for an inn@@ acle in the U.S. city Minneapolis , two people are killed and nine have been wo@@ unded , some of them heavy . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , the fire bri@@ g@@ ade was in critic@@ ised . &quot;
a man died as part of a school building at the explosion .
&quot; first of all , a first missed was also dead . &quot;
&quot; in the dead , it was a question of the school . &quot;
&quot; as a mis@@ fortune , the authorities thought work on a gas guide . &quot;
the holiday time only few people were staying in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tru@@ mp set up according to sc@@ anned tran@@ scription by phone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of Grenz@@ wall
tran@@ scription by phone call between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and Le@@ aders from Mexico and Australia have been published by Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27th , Tru@@ mp called on a phon@@ at with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President described him because he had called publicly proclaimed the wall , saying he said to him , &quot; This may not tell you the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and pregnant , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first attack with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that trade for the USA refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid , &quot; &quot; he would like a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the USA . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp be@@ ended the call , after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ mass@@ acre : activists conduct rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury went through a group of spect@@ ators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ ink@@ ed on the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men joined forces to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man aged man in a needle @-@ pull @-@ off - took a long train at its cig@@ ar and looked out on the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; bel@@ lows the man .
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
Schrei@@ e sh@@ ris@@ sen the silence , as a young black man from the passenger &apos;s seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , just a post @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost all in the audience are very real pl@@ ague . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens of Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody was ever indic@@ ted for the murder .
&quot; it is truly indisp@@ utable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congreg@@ ations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps with the organization of performance . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 year old conference of parliament of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
&quot; for him , the quot@@ ation as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community , that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosec@@ ution , we want ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a Jur@@ assi@@ um car@@ er puts a to@@ wel over the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files , which were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding villages in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process have been suspected . &quot;
but nobody has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on the open base for decades , they say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions around the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , at the pre @-@ board competition in the summer of 1946 . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ächter Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , while a fight down - alleg@@ edly for a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said , the smells of the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby , she carried her , not by her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 Dollar to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; but when she turned away from the prison , and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford bridge closer , surrounded by mo@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that has prepared and arranged the mor@@ ale and closes it out of a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a compl@@ ac@@ al between national and local criminal prosec@@ ution , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks are form@@ ulates even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a elec@@ toral mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you let yourself register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
nearly a decade long Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual report of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their representation is vi@@ vid , touching and is based in a kind of deep racism that many believe it does not exist in America . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to take a look , and even more difficult to see , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about mo@@ ck , because we are confronted with his ugly in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year @-@ year production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - into a space and lou@@ der , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ens Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss c@@ lan@@ co , but he said , the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , playing Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester , and pus@@ hes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , w@@ win@@ ch from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona acc@@ entu@@ ate the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actor ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still batt@@ ling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think that white people back &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you just have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly there shifts the energy in the room , a sense of camera replaced the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is employed to get this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time Ras@@ cona the N word says , he says it sharp and with re @-@ pressure . &quot;
absolutely no one is lau@@ ghing .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed with a dre@@ d@@ dress , is about the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and guides Bil@@ lie Holidays sad Lob@@ ster &quot; Str@@ ange Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen spect@@ ators silence and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost even@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , they were fed to see the performance , many are only down the road . &quot;
they have experienced all nearly eight hours of Georgia &apos;s impressive humidity if Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point the mur@@ ders have stayed an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de takes place , the air feels like that . &quot;
&quot; when the last record of the song sound , Gre@@ ene loads the amount to come closer and insp@@ ects the body name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken in their heads , sign the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ ots a little boy , as if he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes thanks Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actor throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l away and cry their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the withdrawal , who has played the cl@@ an . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ ns two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks out in her arms that breaks the emotional burden of performance finally with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience continues with the actors for dinner together .
&quot; ch@@ atting with a table , a white pair made of Atlanta stimul@@ ated over the post @-@ performance with a black couple that they have just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought hard to find words what feeling the performance has left .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who like themselves and do that , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me , makes me think that the Lyn@@ chen still exists &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; today , the only police officers is mentioned . &quot;
in the same space Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks courtyard at his table he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights .
&quot; he said , he already started to plan the performance in the next year . &quot;
&quot; the im@@ position is inspir@@ ational in a certain way because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we have nothing to learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; who has not studied his own history , who knows his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &apos; , the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth &quot;
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental works , Frank Cast@@ orf works on a colour@@ ful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging from gigantic , six @-@ story scenery . &quot;
&quot; the turn @-@ stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) either shows a s@@ hab@@ by street corner and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that par@@ ked an open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the Rhine is more pos@@ eful than rock@@ erg@@ ers , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;

Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous fi@@ esen H@@ agen that surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he strikes Sieg@@ fried .
later you must believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus Ei@@ che ) dran .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with vigor@@ ous appl@@ ause .
&quot; stor@@ my are celebrated Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Di@@ rig@@ ent Jan@@ owski which prev@@ ent@@ ately in hum@@ ble and hands @-@ smoking hands . &quot;
large appl@@ ause is there for the concert band that shows itself on stage for the first time - given the big heat back into more embarrass@@ ment wear .
&quot; with tension , the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am was expected . &quot;
&quot; he had to make sure that he had to make sure , in 2013 , there was five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the ten &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; ruin . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner may be happy about this .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also a understanding of his view . &quot;
I am a positive resource .
Max crowd works as a volunteer

is it not something unusual during the volunteer service to have several different places of use ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where one does his F@@ S@@ J makes .
you can do it from Alter@@ sheim to Ju@@ gen@@ dar@@ work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
for me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , that was exactly what I got stuck . &quot;
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it was really happening .
differently than in the building of engineering ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
one always has other people front of your head who each have a very different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been fet@@ ched from the family - you must always go individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have any touch ?
quantity : this is not the guy .
there is one area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , a lot of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so life is just . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son is shor@@ tened for more 3,000 jobs and abbrevi@@ ated divi@@ dend to rein@@ vigor@@ ate the business . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son T@@ essa said on Friday , she will build further 3,000 jobs and cut its inter@@ divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the company with which the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; the job creation , the General director John Fall@@ on mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring , in which already 4,000 jobs were lost . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program for a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to rein@@ vigor@@ ate a business , which was made through the quick step to digital learning . &quot;

con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul : NATO @-@ Sol@@ dier killed in self @-@ regul@@ ators
&quot; a self @-@ ord@@ ained has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , one soldiers of Nato killed and several others wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter had been viol@@ ated , an explanation of Nato . &quot;
&quot; confirmed local reports , according to the case of the quarter of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h were also three civilians . &quot;
bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a self @-@ m@@ ord@@ ial two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of Nato is to happen , the explosion on Thursday nights was done , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; of people &quot; impro@@ vised Spr@@ ace sentence . &quot; &quot;
the statement reveals that all the last in a stable state are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital on the field of Bag@@ ram .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there was at least 1.6@@ 62 civil deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
at the end of July a su@@ ic@@ ide @-@ motor@@ om@@ be at least 30 people in an mainly chi@@ ef@@ ic district of Kab@@ ul .
&quot; the Taliban said , they would have carried out this attack . &quot;
&quot; on 31 May , a tremendous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city had more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops 2001 the Taliban from power . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops , the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the self @-@ folders in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns the decision to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule by law@@ suits .
&quot; the US American environ@@ ment@@ ality has made a decision to delay a regulation of the Government of Obama , repe@@ aled that the states are committed to in@@ dem@@ ons the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states def@@ ends the agency due to the stri@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the &quot; &quot; o@@ zone Pro@@ visions 2015 &quot; &quot; and said , she will show the obligation of the agency with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; said T @-@ CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA - in which in part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions should be determined to determine where inc@@ isions are to be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , held on Tuesday c@@ rank@@ y and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental issues that the former President Barack Obama has risen , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost the economic growth according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of democr@@ ats and nature schemes that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and can reinforce the breath@@ able symptoms &quot; as for example as@@ thma . &quot;
municipalities wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts of the council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln , the establishment of a common area in the future seniors . &quot;
&quot; prior to discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the remaining key@@ piece was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; though it will still take , until the so far in the church community , there is no planning space in the community @-@ owned property , but there is now no plans for a private investor to st@@ em@@ ate project more . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a common area . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , has been offered to the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor he would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters , and an adjacent terrace with all 70 square meters area for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the management and the majority of the council are deb@@ ated , such a common room cannot be seen as a meeting point for residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ just living , but open to the congregation . &quot;
&quot; for example , the word made of &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; round . &quot;
&quot; if the decision is made , the decision by providing funds for the current household has been decided already in the last autumn , through funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction lies in the refurb@@ ishment region .
&quot; the establishment of a joint space would be , thus reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 per cent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision maker looks to sign@@ aling to the investor that in this respect , he wants to throw him no bill@@ ets between the legs - as well as P@@ ult@@ z - which reduces the lac@@ tation and the construction of economic power - is possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , this means not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this option . &quot;
if it helps : unanim@@ ously happened to the panel .
it is not that simple as a common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many of its own buildings , with which one can not go so quite quickly , but it is now in common with the common room of the window , says : &quot; I am very difficult to do with it . &quot;
Yvonne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it a deck@@ er sub@@ invention in any case @-@ like or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give any grant , but also get a real , in the two @-@ field turn @-@ adjustable counter@@ parts , is the head@@ line . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , decre@@ asing the decision @-@ proposal , finds three advocates . &quot;
&quot; for instance , it remains in two counter@@ parts of the original program , which summ@@ ari@@ zing Stefan H@@ aller so summ@@ arized : &quot; &quot; if we put the decision so we make a giant step forward to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : Rad@@ ler is lit on the street

the confirmed the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the Mün@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ jen Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
that was last not good . &quot;
&quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an performance level in the first official trial of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the game is sold with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spect@@ ators , the Deutsche Football League ( DF@@ L ) distributed on Friday with . &quot;
to mig@@ rate in the Har@@ z from Stern to Stern
&quot; in the Har@@ z , the nation@@ wide &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; was created . &quot;
this plan is planning the association Observ@@ atory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a Plan@@ etary path exists in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; is used to meet the information needs of many har@@ ass@@ works . &quot;
&quot; connect nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to split up along the planned route and inform about stars and constell@@ ations .
&quot; in the first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well @-@ reaching installations in five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber &quot;
the information on the boards should be added via the internet .
&quot; therefore , at the location of the selection , a good mobile network reception can play a role . &quot;
also accessibility be a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ ring train should be extended by train .
&quot; on the star trail , the observer know a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; declared the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star stronger than another , even though it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; I also im@@ part@@ ed to see what constell@@ ation is a selected star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
the association has been operating in the mountain city of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 .
the location in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z counts according to the Federal Minister of Har@@ z to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y are clearly visible .
&quot; in the uni @-@ town , there have been an initiative since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen , some simil@@ arity like the planned constell@@ ations - the planet . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel near Goe@@ the@@ all@@ ee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ eten@@ weg path leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ ks ( municipality Glei@@ chen ) with the Planet S@@ edn@@ a . &quot;
st@@ ables with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Pl@@ uto at the end point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ ink thus to a sphere of 6,@@ 5 milli@@ meter diameter , while the exact 75 meters away from the sun is 70 cen@@ timeters . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometers .
&quot; while the light is needed from the sun to Pl@@ uto about eight hours , we need a good hour until the pier with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
pedestrian are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
&quot; the march to the next fix@@ ture , but would still last a half year . &quot;
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision event to staged the most thri@@ lling box@@ ing in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ trained World Box@@ ing Council Li@@ ghtw@@ eight @-@ Champion , the cor@@ ridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ spring champion . &quot;
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory over the former four @-@ divisions @-@ World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ zes on Saturday at Show@@ time are both fighters of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How does it go to you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturdays evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple recommended for photos , commented Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to shut down on lightweight .
and he must move on lightweight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
these are demanding the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko vote .
&quot; box@@ ing takes this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asking if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that has to fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to arrange a date in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight @-@ title fight in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this battle might take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and op@@ ted himself openly , to fight the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he appreciate Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; and he will possibly take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the triple champion from River@@ side look very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you did the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show perc@@ ussion , then box@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; both said , they could feel the Mom@@ entum , that built up for his own battle . &quot;
&quot; this is the battle , which has to be performed . &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I waited for the top fighters and that is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four tw@@ ist after tire @-@ space
on Thursday afternoon four people were severely in@@ ju@@ red on Thursday afternoon .
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost shortly before the junction , and probably after a tire @-@ seat control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger sh@@ ud@@ dered to the right of the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he suggested and then lie on the roof at the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ ST@@ IF@@ EN . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely in@@ ju@@ red with the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the past through the lif@@ ebo@@ at service , the A7 was locked towards north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be guided by the accident . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoff@@ mann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andre Hoff@@ mann hopes to return after 2 : 2 for the season @-@ season to Braunschweig that the optimization of def@@ ences in Au@@ e points brings .
&quot; with the first season , Andre Hoff@@ mann was happy with the result , if not the two oppos@@ ore had been at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ore too much , and we have to do even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defen@@ ders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Ore Mountains the Trinity should also be further optimized .
&quot; and a gate after a release , the For@@ tun@@ es want no more to be reached . &quot;
for the future it will be so that no longer imagine Michael ( R@@ ensing ) to the line .
&quot; Hoff@@ mann is convinced that his team is better to fit in preparation with the Trinity , as well as the four @-@ chain . &quot;
&quot; still I do not know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoff@@ mann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are just able to build on the semi @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann player who can build well , &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the requirement is , however , that we do even better harmon@@ ize and we do not afford to make a lot of waste . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoff@@ mann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one cannot speak of a mis@@ sl@@ ing start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance might be quite okay , &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; if we can d@@ ged on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will surely be able to speak of a decent season . &quot;
he wanted to know his coach nothing .
&quot; the start in the season I judge only after six to eight game days , &quot; Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who didn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken pre@@ matur@@ ely due to an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoff@@ mann believes that the players from Au@@ e could even be a little fres@@ her , as they could have had a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascen@@ sion in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 @-@ percentage where they are currently standing , &quot; says the internal defense of Fort@@ una . &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland as easy Favor@@ it on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we throw them away , only because we have the claim to come under the top six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , its balance sheet in just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2 Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from pre @-@ in , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement to meet is arrogan@@ t , and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to do his players on Sunday in no way .
new findings of the Swedish asylum @-@ application tests released
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( R@@ ät@@ t@@ sm@@ e@@ dic@@ ine ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
&quot; they should do more accurately during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration authorities ( migration cuts ) because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees were critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; up to date , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency were told that the person may be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; could possibly be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results in the past months are resistant . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see any major difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person was judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the under@@ sought person 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det found the 5@@ 81 published results , she asked that in 243 such cases the person had openly told that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of the medical age assessment , used in x @-@ ray photos of wisdom , and MR@@ T recordings by Kni@@ fe , which can then be analysed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later as usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had the reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot say it sure , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended however the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk , a child as an adult is neg@@ li@@ gible . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk lies in it , if the person is almost under 18 , in this case it is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes of strong emphasis was put on the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Street and Transport in the government of Freiburg . &quot;
in April the work started at the same time at all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , which disgu@@ ised with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total @-@ length of 4,@@ 80 metres . &quot;
built in 1900 it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it now has come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and road safety , the three components are now thoroughly re@@ constructed . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on Wednesday morning a 1,30 meter wide , and seven tons of heavy so named br@@ ück@@ cap . &quot;
&quot; this is a del@@ usion , which is also used as an operating way . &quot;
the southern part of the bridge is to be used on Friday an extensive meter wide fr@@ appe .
then the pedestrian went out .
&quot; the special thing about it is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been equipped with the patent rolls .
particular f@@ inger@@ ability does this set the wir@@ ing of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; for there , there is also a glass fiber , which are connected to many companies . &quot;
the inhabitants were notified in advance of the work by hand@@ piece on the project .
&quot; in addition , first fish and canc@@ ers had to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building @-@ building and the gathering pace in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by a amp@@ el . &quot;
for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher Local entrance is the road in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three brid@@ ge@@ ani@@ ons are over 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with German potato salad
&quot; it does not come so frequently that parties are moving to a string , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes along what else is difficult to bring to a hat . &quot;
&quot; the Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ DP , F@@ DP , left ) belong to a broad coalition which shows on this day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell invites for &quot; great elec@@ toral campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , which forms together with Alexander Gau@@ land the top @-@ duo for the German Bundestag on 24 September , and the dep@@ uty president of the Beat@@ rix from Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; however , those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D football , but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colour@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; the city was originally planned on a table under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain square , but is now taking place at the parking below of the r@@ ond@@ ary square - and therefore directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum , One World and one of the leading organizers , are really happy : &quot; &quot; great , how many people came here together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &apos; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have be@@ amed many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how is the Af@@ D really reached on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D Vul@@ can@@ ei@@ fel tells you about such an event and got the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was no badge because of the already constructed Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes are not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; overlooking the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; it also does : against 8 p.m. taking a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers that are waiting for the German duo for the Par@@ ag@@ re election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the dep@@ uty president of Stor@@ k of Stor@@ k their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence appears , but so far the officials had a peaceful evening . &quot;
&quot; something more than an hour will take the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is also short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can tor@@ ch - no special benefits .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a repeat with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ ster@@ concert tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , there is a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; on the Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ ko &quot; meets a classic German vocational training with roots in the brass music . &quot;
both lists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ o@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European top @-@ level spre@@ ader .
this is Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist the SWR Symphony .
&quot; both combines the desire , not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also merge the limits of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach like the two like in a new gu@@ and , Daniel K@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece of &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ club N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram , mix classical , jazz and free play to a fascinating whole artwork . &quot;
this core part of the program was performed only this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the prestigious composer N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram has written it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with her special acou@@ sti@@ cs is deliberately included into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art talks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat him to the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art quite openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; when I eat in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes as next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known relationship of the Dutch arti@@ stars was the one to her &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson , which eventually went bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all in@@ sured the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ ar opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine , &quot; I was seriously fallen in everyone I thought . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation there were critic@@ isms that they were bis@@ ex@@ ual , &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and seriously believed in it . &quot;
so it has never seen or hin@@ ders me .
I just liked it never to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them , they turned out to &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; but at school time when they prefer to dress like a Bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been very in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b . &quot;
I really felt attacked and frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed .
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they would not like to be aware of their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that angry me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps I call me some as un@@ think@@ able , but I don &apos;t like it to justify myself before the whole world . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in che@@ ers .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the republi@@ cans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised a great announcement in the West Virginia Rallye .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice inexpensive not the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
Justice which is according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes has noted that he possesses carbon@@ em@@ inen in five states and has inherited a carbon business by his father .
it is worth 1,@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee held on Thursday evening a statement in which it said , &quot; the Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party that would rather work more than it would be great to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 gou@@ vern@@ s and the control of the least legal entity in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , expan@@ sive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by the C@@ BS News . &quot;
co@@ e lo@@ gi@@ sts &apos; Russian ap@@ ology for D@@ oping sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to get back to the sport . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics Chief Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ el said during the IA@@ AF congress at the eve of Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championship that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he is determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , those who were destroyed in competitions and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments the IA@@ AF Congress for the maintenance of the For@@ bidden , which was negotiated in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) notices on State funded by D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ president Co@@ e the Repor@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; all the Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself , that they have experienced some pretty hot times and everything will do to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; , &quot; that Russia will accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the se@@ ated system , &quot; he added . &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will commen@@ ce at the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championship that starts on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
&quot; the head of IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; Dro@@ gent@@ ests are still inadequate and ban coach are still free , he said re@@ por@@ ters in London after a presentation at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
grape act for in Mali cr@@ ashed soldiers
&quot; at a funeral party in the north @-@ polar Fr@@ itz@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two are thought at a helic@@ op@@ crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; for even uns@@ ett@@ led waste , Defence Minister Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) nothing . &quot;
&quot; they drew the two transform@@ ations , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot;
&quot; we tend to be of this highest victim , which they have been undertaken in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year Major and the 47 @-@ year of Nord@@ h@@ essen came from Nord@@ h@@ essen on Wednesday one week ago in the West African Mali .
their s@@ är@@ ge were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead Guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
&quot; at mid@@ day , first only the members of the Church was far@@ ewell . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral party began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
these were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General Manager of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; mo@@ g@@ ings laid down on ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm to the che@@ ers . &quot;
in front of the church followed Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers took the ceremony on a canvas .
Defence Minister of the Ley@@ en marked the ren@@ amed soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and s@@ cour@@ aged .
the St@@ er@@ pillar t@@ mann has built the flight operation of the martial arts tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar with and be one of the first six trained tiger pil@@ ots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ lau@@ s , com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the reg@@ iment to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if these crew could not turn off the crash , then it could not have missed . &quot;
a doubt about the UN Mission in Mali showed the minister of Ley@@ en : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but it is also of high importance &quot; for a country where we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral party the s@@ är@@ ge were brought from the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information . &quot;
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried in his wife after his wife . &quot;
this shared the Royal House on Thursday with .
traditionally the Danish King@@ fis@@ her is attached in the cathedral @-@ church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard was already made a Sar@@ k@@ op@@ ag for the two .
&quot; the Queen be agreed with the decision of her husband , it says further in the press release . &quot;
where Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik bury , be still unclear . &quot;
but he does not have the intention to put together in his French homeland .
&quot; Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik never had a secret of it , that he was not happy with his title . &quot;
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would gladly become king .
&quot; in 2016 he went into retirement and also puts the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ cess &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he don &apos;t see himself as equal in his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Ball@@ eby , the Chief Apostle of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; where the last rest of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he does not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ sex , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Thames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 years of reg@@ att@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography of vo@@ iced Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was s@@ ank@@ le , I preferred wine instead of beer , Silk stock@@ ings instead of stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the reputation of being the soci@@ etal intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not as@@ ham@@ ed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a swift re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP from possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green ruling majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday for the dissolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising resign@@ ation of a Green vote had led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) in a difficult crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official appointment of the country election , the red @-@ green coalition lost its scar@@ ce a @-@ vote majority in the parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ ables welcome her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in Rot@@ enburg ( Des@@ er@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; stated her on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ ac@@ sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend to his Group to accommodate them .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP were supposed to have 69 seats in the low @-@ Sax@@ on land , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new country @-@ tag will be elected on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green country government will now decide whether they can continue to gover@@ n in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l does it however , for indispensable , that the country develops as quickly as its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on another procedure on Tuesday .
the state frame also sees the possibility that the governor of the Prime Minister draws the trust and choose a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; these options have to be legally tested clean , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will discuss all the questions , if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; but somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the policy@@ makers himself says : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it drew himself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the de@@ bian members to return their country @-@ meeting .
&quot; we of course go out of course that she received her Land@@ sc@@ and@@ at , who has received her through the green country list , shared with immediate effect , distributed the provincial met@@ a J@@ ans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the Group Leader of the Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ets . &quot;
they deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the fac@@ tion .
&quot; even before the background that there was no other differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ l@@ erk@@ an@@ did@@ at Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over@@ head of the Sax@@ on green @-@ MEPs El@@ ke T@@ asi to CD@@ U as a betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Members of Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al to the constitu@@ ents and voters , but also betra@@ y@@ al of Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , the country to choose quickly . &quot;
the resign@@ ation T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Nieder@@ sachsen the majority .
&quot; the policy@@ makers of &quot; &quot; in their final van@@ ity and in her frustration , their personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ for@@ e@@ play , and attempts to beat from political capital . &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ ac@@ sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his MEPs to absor@@ b El@@ ke T@@ aps into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , cast T@@ west before , with personal career paths , to fal@@ si@@ fy the result of the country @-@ election in 2013 . &quot;

&quot; agricultural Minister in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses over si@@ gh eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Land@@ sm@@ in@@ ister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is speech and answer in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against det@@ ox@@ et@@ ected eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumer drivers and encourage the eggs in your refrigerator accurately and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer &apos;s consumer portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ .com the federal states represent the latest information on the affected eggs char@@ ms .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to everything we currently know , health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now , Al@@ di is taking the best possible crisis action - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ tening of the Federal Minister is not really perceived ? &quot;
the food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately rec@@ alled immediately and since the announcement of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same way as the manufacturers to bear care of that the products sold @-@ in @-@ time and health are harmless .
&quot; if the resi@@ dual content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not limited . &quot;
un@@ contaminated eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not the companies to blame .
sitting operations and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the same characteristic , the production facility meets no immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is necessary to reck@@ on illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the harvest . &quot;
is it only missing on the staff or even in the conclusi@@ ve competence ?
but it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; however , for truth , food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled by 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; precisely because of this , a consistent education of such events and the hand@@ over to the cou@@ sins in the cases where crimes can be found , of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have been clearly stated several times that I expect a seam@@ less clarification from the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular alarm system with food sk@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer goods and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and traffic @-@ capable foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ conden@@ sing insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumer goods and consumers are entitled to justice . &quot;
&quot; by the pan@@ ed means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ law@@ ful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cides Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals is not acceptable and must be completed immediately . &quot;
&quot; it must be consistently applied to all levels , and be worked with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I expect from all the competent authorities , that the atomic fact is un@@ resolved and un@@ resolved . &quot;
how to impact the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent un@@ restricted issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s World tre@@ k@@ ord will not distur@@ b from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A yet , as the leading organization that the European game has over@@ looked at power , cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair play rules that have been launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to point out that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar without great losses have been financed . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid € 222 million ( 262 million $ ) to purchase the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can certainly make money loose so N@@ ey@@ mar writes and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team through the energy rich ro@@ jo@@ king of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; to apply a lot of money for the purchase of players , but need to control with legitimate revenue streams , which enable them to store the Bre@@ ak @-@ E@@ ven point in their way of football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini at the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that a huge debt had taken tremendous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ked to ruin , when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P from concentration on the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then a strong investment to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P pre@@ disposition period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of € 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ r@@ ots continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly is FF@@ P not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future yet , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible at the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P compared to The Associ@@ ated Press &quot; last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of its contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year deal so that the deposits can be taken over for the next five years in the amount of 44,@@ 4 million euros .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has taken the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G has been reduced by 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams members earn for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to persu@@ ade their financial perspectives by connecting their revenues by companies , associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could be the PS@@ G &apos;s PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ings should exceed the default market rates , the UEF@@ A would do not apply as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; that was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsorship of the P@@ SA managed by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar about payments of the Organis@@ ing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar could come .
but PS@@ G and Kat@@ ar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar Cup amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will simply be able to find out of such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEF@@ A remain silent , every attempt to consider the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepared discussions with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , which are familiar to the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the final reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsorship De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ ics . &quot;
the Association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will increase .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players go to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s sign by declar@@ ing that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financing dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s latter &apos;s ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state which is an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play , because there are different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new mold
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y aboard chocolate is produced for Swiss Swiss .
&quot; now , the s@@ avor@@ ed collaboration is in front of a possible end : the airline writes the contract new . &quot;
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; northwest @-@ Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the Air@@ line will be close to a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speech . &quot;
some 17 million small red @-@ white pack@@ aged sh@@ utt@@ les to 14 grams per year distribute the passenger in front of the landing to the passengers .
the Swiss cost does not want to make any information available .

but more important is all@@ em@@ al of advertising effect : for a shift manufacturer it is a prestigious order .

&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nost@@ alg@@ ically because of the glorious day of the 80 @-@ he years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter the Sk@@ etch @-@ Kom@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories . &quot;
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like would the time barely .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; functional surprisingly good , not just because of its absurd lob@@ ster ( it contained a original story for an speaking di@@ ose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;

&quot; at one point , a character with an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some In@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .

and there is another crazy mal@@ icious P@@ lot in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ known impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the ex@@ classes are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
&quot; it makes especially great fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons under@@ li@@ ppen@@ che of &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; , &quot; whose former big @-@ Man @-@ on camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of acci@@ dental del@@ ity that could cause this fran@@ chise like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ ET Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon is now remin@@ is@@ cent of a different type of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; with its east @-@ against @-@ west ring @-@ ring . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy of Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka written com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director gives us a found TV series : a Romanian Drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;

&quot; there are some beautiful g@@ ags on the prestige ( the police spend the time doing chess on TV , how Americans may do it with football ) . &quot;

blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
police is a blow to the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar @-@ district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart numerous objects were sear@@ ched out as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office Kon@@ stanz am Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , 15 def@@ endants were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 , and have already issued arrest warran@@ t against this . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the officials presented large quantities marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at the same raid in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two bel@@ lows Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ t .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany according to Germany .
at the action Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators were involved .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia is organised crime crime , heavy violence , tried , and rob@@ bery , as well as rob@@ bery and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office is determined against organised drug trading in the South of Germany . &quot;
&quot; between the prosec@@ utor &apos;s lawyers in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the grand@@ use was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; into the vision@@ ary of the investigations , especially Italian nation@@ als with close connection to the Italian Mafia . &quot;

lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; data from citizens that should not arise . according to a report , the foreig@@ ner in Germany has considerable shortcomings . &quot;
the lead to partly gra@@ zing errors in asylum procedures .
&quot; the representative for the refugee management of the German government , Frank @-@ Jürgen ways , has expressed attention to large gaps in the Aus@@ länder@@ al register in a media report . &quot;
&quot; defects during the registered data may result in asylum proceedings and deport@@ ations &quot; to partly gra@@ vi@@ ating mis@@ decisions , &quot; war@@ ned in an analysis , which is the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the properties , there are ten million people with foreign nationality , including about 5,@@ 7 million out of non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data are therefore managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data were not adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good yet . &quot;
&quot; some cases have been found in cases of 1921 , &quot; &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizen and in the register they should no longer arise . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data allow@@ ances can be in@@ slo@@ w@@ ingly slow , &quot; says the report to further . &quot;
&quot; in statistics about rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ able people , those EU citizens have seized , who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; but such false rules , however , led to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with expression &quot; , &quot; it means that it is said to be analysed . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the German government has apparently started to send refugee families with 16 @-@ year children back to Italy , when they were submitted by there . &quot;
&quot; this arises from an internal paper of the Federal Minister for Migration and refugees ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re Newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper it means that the BAM@@ F lead such procedure &quot; regarding families with children - except for inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - after Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , the newspaper also has a reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin treaty , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to achieve them first . &quot;
&quot; if a Mig@@ rant can reach another EU country , this state can res@@ ign it into the in@@ sel@@ or . &quot;
&quot; for reason , the Office write : &quot; meanwhile , the capacity of families with min@@ der@@ aged children in Italy increases significantly . &quot;
Italy gave birth to the reception and accommodation of families warran@@ ted .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) consider these commitments for sufficient .
&quot; also , other EU states would send back to refugees in the scope of the Dublin Convention . &quot;
&quot; the interior political spokes@@ person of the Bundestag in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children , because of the fau@@ lts in the Italian asylum system of human rights un@@ law@@ ful conditions and a haz@@ ard to Kin@@ des@@ ist . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is likely to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulations have taken over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; y@@ ields &quot; &quot; when they engage the interest rates on family members in the midst of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 , which has reduced interest rates to 0,25 % , whereas in this month less members stri@@ ves a rise , as weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.9 % and for 2018 in 1,6 % and war@@ ned that the pressure on the budget would continue to rise to almost 3 % in autumn . &quot;
&quot; but they realized that in the next few years Zin@@ ser@@ ca@@ vities would be needed to breed the inflation of the Bre@@ xit , and she said that the credit costs may have to rise more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also vote for a part of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s economic package , which was published a year after Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for finance for finance from next February cheap financial aid for banks , although said now , that they are expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after deciding on interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the real households continues to be charged further consumption . &quot;
&quot; the interest rates repeti@@ tive that &quot; &quot; a certain trigger of monetary policy &quot; &quot; to cooling inflation and a &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; amount would be expected to be the markets . &quot;
the markets is currently forecast for the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank stressed , however , that increases and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts for this and next year are compared with the 1.9 % and 1.9 % in comparison with the growth forecasts .
it has retained its growth forecasts on 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell according to these messages from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0,5 % to the US dollars and fell to 0.2 % at the 1.11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes , after the recent disappointing growth will have taken the increasing expectations of an interest rate and GDP rise in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth will be expected in the third quarter at 0.3 % , although it will easily recover after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation review offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by a rising inflation and low @-@ day sal@@ aries , since the tigh@@ tening will first get worse before they get better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy can not prevent the income of income in the next few years , &quot; but she added that wages becomes clear to the end of its three @-@ year progn@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributed to the weak pounds , which is compens@@ ated for a part of lower consumption . &quot;
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0,25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote that resulted in the for@@ ks of the lease .
the Bank appreci@@ ates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the final Jud@@ gment of the Bank to the interest rates , the call for a Zin@@ c has risen , since inflation has pushed pressure on hard households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July had a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; in June last month , inflation has declined from 2.9 % in June to 2.8 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will come back in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said , the crossing in relation to their goal of 2 % be &quot; &quot; completely &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ mmer , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent return of s@@ wap products , the mort@@ gage market may be more competitive again since the l@@ essor are looking for stores and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those who take the existing De@@ als and complete the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) shall be controversial for more than 10,000 people
&quot; from September , after a fight against the High Court against financing the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV prevention treatment . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one prior to the intercourse pre @-@ prescribed prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the Inf@@ ection risk of high risk assessment by around 86 percent , now supplied by health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process , after the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court had confirmed a verdi@@ ct of the Supreme Court of Justice , the N@@ HS had the authority in order to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ un@@ announced chess message was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first , who will enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October 2018 before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 . &quot;
prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV medicines that be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduced HIV @-@ transfer in infection @-@ endangered types .
taking pre@@ p before the intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent a HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or as two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come to question for the treatment are s@@ alo@@ ule , or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners that were not successfully treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics the participants will identify appropriate participants , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV @-@ status will not be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and registered with a doctor , can also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic . &quot;
the program is signed by £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply medicines that week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p to be collected and implemented in a large scale , and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said , &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevention of HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if it is targeted at most vulnerable and vulnerable people , the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a hearing with a partner , resulting in improving many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority has to be done so that the study will be done quickly throughout the country and that no one who has given a risk to HIV . &quot;
&quot; now since the pre@@ p test@@ es was coated , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected persons . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow of the Minister of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome after monthly , late @-@ late implementation through the government and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence showing how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us one step closer to the understanding of the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it is contributing to the ending of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and cl@@ ever@@ e designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , took part in 2014 by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I sear@@ ched for something that was similar to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I have fallen in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square kilometres was completely out@@ dated . &quot;
originally a A @-@ room estate with a wel@@ ded layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne Stau@@ ber and a mezzanine to use the generous cover level .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , big windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my request , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose they made the architectural and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.5 @-@ feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine which you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative thinking to release the en@@ core .
&quot; the steel plant is rather complicated , &quot; &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were floo@@ ded , without that we had to bear . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or at the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled it to place Er@@ fan , two rooms in full height - with lots of extra drama . &quot;
for the mezzanine looks a classic copper window by Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mir@@ r@@ ored Gold Fur@@ nit@@ ure , sil@@ ber@@ ne ac@@ z@@ ente and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille Li@@ ghting put the style for the program . &quot;
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in addition to theatre , space and light . &quot;
at both ends is a short cor@@ ridor mir@@ r@@ ored to let him take longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance mir@@ r@@ ored units place for all the bests@@ eller and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; by the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ y space , the beauty of living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went out there , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ fied M@@ DF door . &quot;
&quot; it is quite important , so it is when you slide the door very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the cl@@ ever@@ ly use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or as your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate mak@@ ler will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the ground floor and use high quality materials , which provide the room to its luxury advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not forget you into the electric plugs at the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
&quot; it shows that an apartment can turn out into something quite admir@@ able by a good design and increased square kilometers . &quot;
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollars in real estate
&quot; two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the Dyn@@ asty , in a confrontation due to one of the greatest property of the property of Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developers Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he led him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets shall be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw himself from family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 li@@ stings in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family has since 1973 bought a shop in the Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded in je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of de Lu@@ tis comprises offices in the town centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her died father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; chief operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two @-@ thirds of the enterprise , and Paul about a third . &quot;
a jurisdiction that implies that Col@@ in property has the value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul as a problem .
&quot; the chapters proposed by Col@@ in proposed agreement have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; wrote in 2015 in the first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; on Friday last Friday , the initial hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claimed , excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in argu@@ ed that this is not true , but also throwing Paul before , some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hope to submit the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes , that the family is the most important priority , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs are in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides of the law firm . &quot;
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her husband &apos;s husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and delicacies made from the late 1950 &apos;s years and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , opened in Col@@ in the first je@@ ans of the family . &quot;
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co when he was in High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their ownership g@@ unpleasant to their sons . &quot;
Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court &apos; wrote them .
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claimed that Mark were paid by the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , says Paul &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very back although he was a former AF@@ L manager and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and her lawyer .
&quot; just Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts may be . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to complain about and drag our family name by the dishes , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not have deliber@@ ate that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our issue will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new Stab@@ sch@@ ef is planning to limit the media @-@ ab@@ stin@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and are failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reports that the new Stab@@ sch@@ ef of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to president Tru@@ mp , including reports of the news media - in the hope of keeping the head on a more uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece by re@@ por@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Stab@@ sch@@ ef of the White House , met at his first working day with leading employees , he presented a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he w@@ ool up : bad information that fall into the hands of the President . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow , whether on paper or in brief@@ ings , because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to pi@@ mp Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media diet . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television is sufficient for centuries - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if Candi@@ date was angry when a unfair coverage was angry , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , &quot; said the former elec@@ toral advis@@ er Sam Nun@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to hold Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter &apos;s habit under control , according to six former elec@@ toral campaign , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter will ever &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps these camp@@ agn@@ en@@ ers don &apos;t know what we don &apos;t know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets would have to contain even more po@@ inter without their interventions .
we will probably never experience something about the twe@@ et that Tru@@ mp has not been sent .
&quot; if his staff made it a few times , tried to follow him away from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but nobody has consistently prevent it , that Tru@@ mp has been highlighted . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , which consists of competing parties always try to present their own agenda by bringing Tru@@ mp material that possibly promotes their views from the world . &quot;
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this history - reported in May about the preference of the consultants to dubi@@ ous information about strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by re@@ por@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks and that he will find out how these come from . &quot;
&quot; precisely this happened at the end of February , when someone was a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty Stab@@ sch@@ ef@@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks to be in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was ban@@ ished because of chic@@ ks permanently from Twitter , or that he has no concrete evidence offered or that he vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; he added that the former Stab@@ ur@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &apos; tried to dep@@ loy a system to manage the paper@@ work and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ si@@ ves Self , and his consultants are still seeking influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ sear@@ ched crimin@@ als get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the co @-@ aid of the population will be praying and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police in all of Europe will be ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards at dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the sear@@ ched sword @-@ bre@@ eder are not known , indications of the population is hop@@ ed and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , following the &quot; &quot; Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; calendar of the winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences could have shown that many wings of holiday destinations are hidden , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 post@@ cards have put together 21 post@@ cards from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , there are the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times it was viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online ges@@ tures could have been arrested , at least eleven of it due to evidence following the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; million@@ aires series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some deci@@ ph@@ oned travel@@ er on war foot@@ wear , who have negotiated one of the congregation to return to a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosp@@ erous road from Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aires series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of Transpor@@ ters , after they were shot up only in May , without negl@@ ecting from one of the Council , to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tak@@ e@@ full group found a gap in the defense lines and drag@@ ged their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry people have pus@@ hes the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &apos; useless be to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous residents said : &quot; &quot; you have moved there on the eve , after being sent out by Bentley He@@ ath , where they cast stones on the pas@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the Council has to be forced by embarrass@@ ment to implement , since when dealing with the problem was useless . &quot;
the travellers were there in May there were moved and are back again .
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long under@@ lines in order to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy , continue to pay my community if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot;
&quot; a resident who did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of these travelers just to pl@@ unge from another round . &quot;
the numbers have this time increased and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp in the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and working with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to continue it as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many residents can report a anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by invo@@ ke 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation where the court has to test , when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt will be renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambience operating company mbH to the 13th of April 2014 , the time spent around 30 000 nights per year and also revenues by the city tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in view of the increasing numbers of refugees who arrived at the district , the hotel buildings offered by the Land@@ rat@@ ory as a collective accommodation , which cat@@ ered for contro@@ versy . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the deployment of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was at that time in the community not un@@ disp@@ uted .
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt , Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the site location and already spoke at that time by serious prosp@@ ective buyers in the house . &quot;
he should reserve right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with chair@@ men Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof with a voluntary au@@ ction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus @-@ category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter building four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s Men .
&quot; you hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof have been standing in front of the entrance for a longer time , and when one enters the house , it will be clear that extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were taken out , blankets to be part , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is supposed to be renewed in the black style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with great gif@@ ted showers , the entrance area is converted , there will be new windows . &quot;
&quot; everything was later &quot; &quot; nice brush &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expressed . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece , &quot;
&quot; the spa , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; it does not want to position at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale center level . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual leisure , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
conversations with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism @-@ direc@@ tor Michael Kr@@ ause he already led to so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are equal to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants not to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; under a million euros , he expects it . &quot;
&quot; outside the outside , the outside was already visible , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard creates a large terrace , which is open from the restaurant that is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ ists : US @-@ Special investig@@ ator sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair for US President Donald Tru@@ mp is intended to have approved Robert Mu@@ eller according to a report a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
&quot; the panel has recorded the work in recent weeks , the Wall Street Journal wrote under appeal to the matter of familiar people . &quot;
the paper exam@@ ines the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has extended its investigations and intensified .
&quot; the sender CN@@ N reported , there are already first demonstrations in the body related to a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s and a Russian Ombud@@ sper@@ son . &quot;
U.S. intelligence agencies compl@@ aining the Krem@@ lin for a longer time target@@ ing specifically in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there was agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investigations , several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ cans . &quot;
&quot; finally , Mu@@ eller accepted more and more tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment among the magni@@ fying glass . &quot;
&quot; the Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special investig@@ ator has moved to the center in front of a few weeks , and I am looking for the accus@@ ation whether the President in the course of the affair may hin@@ dered the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to check and decide the evidence in possible failures , and decide whether indic@@ t@@ ment should be charged . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called charges .
mostly they are switched on when it is bigger and contro@@ versy .
the procedure always carried out behind closed doors .
&quot; the panel can also be switched from the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office to read , for persons of the em@@ bodi@@ ment under E@@ id . &quot;
&quot; according to the sender CN@@ N broad@@ casts were already exhibited , in order to rot@@ ate the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp j@@ r. and Russian lawyer . &quot;
individuals who were involved in the meeting were asked to be a statement called in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tru@@ mp j@@ r. also Tru@@ mp@@ s consultants and son @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ p election Paul Man@@ a@@ fort continued with conversation .
&quot; legal experts spoke on Thursday evening on Thursday evening TV , that the entry show that Mu@@ eller lay in his work not too shy and that he should be needed , should act quickly . &quot;
&quot; but it does not necessarily mean that Grand Jury will stop at the end , in order to decide on the survey of an indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the replacement of the body at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tru@@ mp is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the president on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ history is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the theme give the Democrats a possibility to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion , he kno@@ b none of the creation of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this work is also usually in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House feared all measures that accelerated the work of the special intermedi@@ ary in a fair &quot; way accelerated .
the former F@@ BI boss James Com@@ ey told three times that not to be determined against the President .
there is no reason to accept that something was changed in this statement .
&quot; but Mu@@ eller was only used , after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been rep@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; because of this rag@@ m@@ eric , accus@@ ations were loud against Tru@@ mp , he used to hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him for a setting of investig@@ ations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; according to the representation of US @-@ media , the White House gathered material against the special medium and its employees . &quot;
the delet@@ ing spec@@ ulation about whether tru@@ mp is released .
&quot; unlike in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , such as President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position where he could be strengthened on the President of the President of the Minister of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to have a step but prev@@ ent@@ able .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented on Thursday , according to which the special investig@@ ators could no longer be released so easily . &quot;
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ice @-@ ice drives in the Antarc@@ tic
in the west @-@ arc@@ tic Arctic has solved a gigantic ice @-@ hill from the narro@@ west size of Berlin from the Schel@@ del@@ s .
&quot; this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar@@ stern , and Marine research on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the length of a tri@@ llion tonnes of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large Kol@@ oss , now coming to the north and will probably need two , three years until he is mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , one of the largest ice gi@@ ants who have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; how the climate change has played a role in the break@@ down of ice , is unclear . &quot;
&quot; overall , there have been a series of un@@ common break@@ through@@ s in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( N@@ S@@ ID@@ C ) in a factor background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be combined with the warming . &quot;
the Kol@@ oss was now a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s .
Schel@@ del@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by major gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it is thus growing constantly into the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this Schel@@ del@@ ses was the balance of w@@ ax@@ ing and breaking down a few years ago .
a complete Schel@@ del@@ is be there and writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
&quot; I speak a lot about it , that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s in danger be , because the forward @-@ edge can@@ did have never with@@ drawn as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice @-@ plate under tension and can be broken , if at a key place a piece brake . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ del@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level as it pus@@ hes on the water and pus@@ hes water as much water as it is after the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the Schel@@ del@@ usion leads to the gl@@ aci@@ ers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the sli@@ pper@@ y degree , writes the British research project to observe the Antarc@@ tic ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s is after AW@@ I @-@ data with almost 50 000 square kilometres the fourth biggest Schel@@ del@@ s of the Antarc@@ tic .
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front @-@ edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it &apos;s a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice sign comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most widespread withdrawal since the beginning of the records , &quot; he confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists have been controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s will now grow again or long in the long run , and perhaps together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even though this researchers fall back to the break@@ up of this gigantic ic@@ eberg , does not fall on climate change , so in the past few decades many king@@ doms of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula are falling apart . &quot;
&quot; this long division of Antarc@@ tica , in direction of South America . &quot;
according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey the ice surface of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has gone to 28 000 square kilometers since the 19@@ 50s .
the decline has contributed significantly to the decline .
&quot; the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has passed in the past 50 years by around three degrees , and thus t@@ amed to the fields in which the temperature at the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to use Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy free places , the CD@@ U , coming out of the worker @-@ association , to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only just before the summer break , the calendar has 41 new places in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 An@@ ders and officials work for the roundabout in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have gone on their first working day .
the cur@@ riculum in the circle are apparently very sought .
around 620 applications were to be listed in vain places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to be able to address the increasing requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are still 50 connected parts in the circle M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers are also sought by the forces of general management . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now work together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG to take the initiative and start the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
the management shall work according to the desire of the parties &quot; a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term condition for professional forces , but forward @-@ oriented of the application scar@@ c@@ ely is called it . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on the internal and external , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a imaging system , request CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this already sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has done it with a personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities advertise good officials and presented and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is given by a regul@@ right &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age of employees comes from the service . &quot;
so high time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes out with his party even beyond the joint application . &quot;
he has long ago been at the roundabout for a lazy surprise when he was publicly challenged to the staff cost @-@ free and the rest of the parties were stun@@ ned .
people want to be reviewed all the options that make a resign@@ ation from the municipal work@@ ings association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the roundabout should also work with trade unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the circular cities - as peoples . &quot;
&quot; thus the CD@@ U , the employees and officials try to pay better than the collective service of the public service is actually fores@@ een . &quot;
&quot; sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money there is only when you switch to a higher level that is based on vocational years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up , in which to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitutes Act . &quot;
last but not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers have coun@@ ties Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ tor Martin Richter a problem : they have too little personal .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone of NGO @-@ migrants @-@ lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has NGOs to use the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they don &apos;t have to continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ niti@@ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth ret@@ ains &apos; , because their team worked effectively with human traffic@@ kers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organization that has only been operating for one year since one year , it has been to express itself as a detailed pro@@ pul@@ ling of the Italian public prosec@@ utor &apos;s Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . we are so sorry that we can &apos;t operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can use all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , super@@ vised since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his crew cap@@ tures infl@@ atable migrants on board , which can be delivered directly from human traffic@@ kers and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; meeting at least such a meeting , just 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the Ak@@ te of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents of Italian media has been published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected , referring to the authority of the Italian coastal guard , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of conduct , boats like I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must first have an Italian police officers on board their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations , have so far explained to hold down to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not make any &quot; major changes or disability &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ out actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign in , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organization doctors without borders ( M@@ SF ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants that came to rescue operations in Italy , in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan territorial Guard and the cooperation with the local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Cher@@ ad , Niger , and Mali . measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;

&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ s@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region , to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and sights . &quot;
there were three available guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ s@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ s@@ heim was a welcome Extra .
the first tour led with hot summer @-@ temperatures along the vineyards of Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; it followed viewing points , partly in the towers , of which one could look far beyond the fal@@ seh@@ ood forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;

&quot; fact : e@@ sports has long been a serious sector to become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels . &quot;
they have also recognized the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ a who are increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid July an e @-@ sport department and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to ama@@ ze over new young audi@@ ences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; that there are still several shifts on this train . &quot;
&quot; in the coming weekend , the football World Association will organize FIFA in London the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; where the gam@@ er of various clubs can compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; besides switches and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven qualified . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t looks great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 year old , that young people will still go to the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ spor@@ tsmen under contract , one could be much more often present on these markets than once a year . &quot;
what is it about ?
&quot; in the E @-@ Sport computer games as &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sports they have established , in which the pros compete against each other . &quot;
and in the Asi@@ ans 2022 E @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many people the idea is secure for sure .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has long been dealing with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is Com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions , which one can also find in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress@@ ful change . &quot;
&quot; moreover , we need cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response time . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only work on the console but also train their body and respect the nutrition .
&quot; the pitch player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but there are also problems : &quot; &quot; D@@ oping is becoming more and more a subject . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls must be difficult for online gaming , and in the scene the structures of classic sports . &quot;
positive highlights the scientists highlights the high inclusive effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; the players are on the way , that is like a big global family , there is no intercultural communication . &quot;
a study of the management consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Association &apos;s Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , in Germany , 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly on advertising , sponsorship and big tournaments . &quot;
sales at 130 million are expected in three years .
&quot; against the almost 2.1 billion euros in the Bundes@@ liga , this is very little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant . &quot;
international are a number of countries already .
great markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball ho@@ ists Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton &apos;s co @-@ invested in the e@@ sports competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe does a lot .
&quot; in an norweg@@ ian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a teaching , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the Bundes@@ liga team is now committed to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is lag@@ ging Germany &quot; , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to fall in nostal@@ gia , and the old times clari@@ fied , is no longer sufficient today . &quot;
&quot; it is about to preserve the tradition of the organisation , but the company at the same time to al@@ ign the company at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; there you can not stick to it , that only when football remains as it was always . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy for su@@ ic@@ ide , condemned &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encourages their friend to su@@ ic@@ ide by lyrics and calls for su@@ ic@@ ide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed on mal@@ nutrition . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned in June due to the casual killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ tr@@ eastern .
&quot; my son was my best friend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carter &apos;s allowed to stay free up to appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psych@@ ic disease .
&quot; dressed in red h@@ oses and a cre@@ me@@ ager Bl@@ use , Carter as with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ down eyes , when it was condemned . &quot;
&quot; your actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ ution of the Court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ry lawyer &apos;s lawyer , it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance which she is completely depl@@ orable . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find that their &quot; old age or maturity &quot; or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor was a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there is no day , in which I am not praying without the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want it to be proud of me and how I am going with everything . I try , despite all my p@@ ains that we will carry with us for eternity to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it in it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never be persec@@ uted by the realization &quot; &quot; that they will never be part of the wedding of her brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have with whom I have been together for my birth each day , is a pain I will always remember for the rest of my life . &quot;
&quot; the case appears to set a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit another su@@ ic@@ ide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of a carbon @-@ oxid@@ ation in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention on himself , after carto@@ on@@ loo@@ t texts that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hands you down , spr@@ ing@@ ed of a building , er@@ ste@@ che yourself , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she was sent over the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of his su@@ ic@@ ide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All that you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy , and ord@@ ained that she would benefit by any press from the fall . &quot;
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; the few , the Carter defended , belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was condemned in Italy because of Mor@@ des at their British ro@@ ommate before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua could have allowed me to run the Audi Cup as captain , is not a coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern has been a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner .
&quot; something was there different on his place in the cabin , that Joshua saw Kim@@ me immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide , on the second day of Audi C@@ ups was of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made himself random t@@ ying on the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria &apos;s captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the one could have been better running than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of Coach could tell me so .
&quot; not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al had been chosen by youth players , Deb@@ üt@@ ants and straight from the holiday of the existing C @-@ El@@ f as player leaders , but he was chosen . &quot;
&quot; sugar be@@ ca , one just distri@@ butes to those who want to see a lot , which one wants to keep in La@@ une . &quot;
&quot; so who was chosen to enter the heritage of Lah@@ m , a small extra motivation can only use well . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed , &quot; This is what you want as a player to take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
&quot; right behind , that is now his position , the white ties at the arm did its others . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , Kim@@ me in this start @-@ formation like the one who can also take the rod in his hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ divided tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had the look for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
&quot; Vid@@ al thus , to over@@ play his lack of fitness ( fol@@ dable up hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches to tie out on the devil &apos;s come out to the achievements of Asia travel ( fol@@ ly also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not fall negative into their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
that is all fol@@ ly good .
&quot; Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the resistance , both ag@@ ated sou@@ ver@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the renowned Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition they tried to be successful in the game building a few times . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy gave that the result was not that way we had hop@@ ed .
but also he showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; temp@@ ting , Tem@@ plates : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bavaria is still used for the new , it looked after the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example was not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me after a few scar@@ ed declar@@ ations in his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting phrase &quot; &quot; what happens here , I have already noticed . &quot;
you just need to win any game with Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new . &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates O@@ F@@ B @-@ ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s ground@@ floor foot@@ b@@ aller reported just before the game on Twitter and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best desired .

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ical Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ ła Tempo
&quot; it was often uncomfortable , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) and economic minist@@ ries in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
&quot; this is evident after more than one year , in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request of a change in economic policy - and bl@@ acks at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , chairman of the Association of Tri@@ er companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing cher@@ ish the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt . &quot;
the largest K@@ ehr@@ e sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the rag @-@ closure of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now very top .
&quot; in this year , the ministry will hopes for a planning process , until 2021 the building is supposed to stand . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country is also playing the West@@ um@@ ination Tri@@ er , which stands in the urgent need for the federal traffic plan . &quot;
&quot; aim is to take the track in December 2020 , says Minister of Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
Nat@@ us sees in it a sign for regional but internationally competing companies .
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce ) Tri@@ er stri@@ ves , as stimul@@ ated by the Wis@@ sing , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend in supermarkets for ten years . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to set up an own company lo@@ wed the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Tri@@ er sees in the new master @-@ bonus an additional incentive for young train@@ ee , says CEO Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
planned is a bonus of 1000 Euros for the best@@ informed Master@@ check and 2500 euros when gradu@@ ates within ten years after the master training is self @-@ employed .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; in the planned street construction , quick facts are to create , at the same time fl@@ ap it the country the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive leader of the I@@ HK Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; from 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing wants to adapt to regional mobility , so far 29 places are occupied . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ respon@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to calculations of the accounting station to invest in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of national roads .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the skilled workers in the region .
ern@@ ü@@ tern@@ ess is also the previous l@@ ati@@ tude in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had only evaluated the network supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the 3.4 . &quot;
it fittings on stock@@ pil@@ ing Internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
&quot; ex @-@ Economy , E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is at the moment left out of politics and is still sitting on the Super@@ visory Board of the Wind@@ mill Pro wind . &quot;
&quot; in April , the Gre@@ ens left Lem@@ ke on April to be President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they had already cleared the field after four months due to dis@@ agreements . &quot;
Audi is to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel cars - car manufacturers face with a counter@@ action
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chair said , the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; there is intelligent options as driving restrictions , and thus referring to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - Diesel to prohi@@ bit or to restrict . &quot;
Daim@@ ler announced that there are three million Mercedes cars to be modified in Europe for reducing its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprise as recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines are considered a car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ obil@@ es , systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles to install exhaust mani@@ pulation , take too , which makes it difficult to keep the price of the car competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignore the powerful auto@@ firms and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies attempt to avoid the errors of Volkswagen to prevent the use of so @-@ called waste devices , which could regulate the provisions if a car has been tested , but with normal travel conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several of Volkswagen were charged by Volkswagen , others will be examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , Itali@@ ans , and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put in court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen to have installed a system to handle emissions rules in Europe and a request that focused on the United States . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be the Volkswagen hard strain : the luxury automobile manufacturers , contributes to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Sh@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against g@@ rief
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most @-@ released Car@@ to@@ on Zeich@@ ner , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ases of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian still features and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; during the first years as an artist , he proposed among other things as a char@@ ger for lucky cards by which he frustr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris ended at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his Car@@ to@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo has found many fans .
over and over again the artists of cities inspire .
&quot; large , ro@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures c@@ avor@@ ting in drawings with the slide tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he still sits his own information on the drawing table , she works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; via calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , pupp@@ ets and watches will find his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread much spread throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a Giraffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los and test@@ es animals in his drawings - who has a thousands of thousands . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come into the cinema wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the screen@@ play is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , it is rather focused on the TV series that is produced , as its original design@@ ations , wor@@ ris@@ ed . &quot;
lav@@ ender in Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is due to the d@@ rought extreme conditions and due to the diseases of transmitted insects , what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to find great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ im , expert of the agricultural research institutions of the CRI@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively at risk , because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in spring and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the lifetime of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ fac@@ ades , and with very dri@@ er weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; lav@@ ender oil lo@@ ops not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also in demand for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ m said , &quot; &quot; instead of having a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ ENT@@ W@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or curved . &quot;
so we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered to be considered , a better water distribution and the slo@@ wing of the plants with a protective blend of sound and water and the development of varieties , which are resistant to dry . &quot;

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the managers of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce are normally brought together to review their plans for the reporting of recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and c@@ eas@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
&quot; it was told to them , that it is important to change their routines . &quot;
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : you should take their children with the office , who were the target of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or they leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; ask the re@@ por@@ ter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and stomach . &quot;
&quot; there are drug regul@@ ators , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists , who are suspected to stand on the sal@@ ary list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no retirement from violence , and during all the land the cor@@ p@@ ses , are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to began in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , their editors and their inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of its numerous books on violence associated with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his lack becomes deeply felt , although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which indicates the fa@@ ç@@ ade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , who will be his smiling face with spectac@@ les or his typical Panam@@ era . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mare , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 is a Son@@ der @-@ Federal Prosec@@ utor &apos;s office , in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with the most thousands of murder that are linked each year with drug and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed in court . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ tr@@ un@@ east and although the terrain is now even tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to w@@ asting my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we sm@@ ashed all . &quot;
in the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez has left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks far before its rot@@ er Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men and 12 times he was shot on him , presum@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; &quot; twelve &quot; &quot; river . &quot;
the cap went away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to fly free in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest last year and delivery in the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a , one of the most bloo@@ dies@@ t battle areas of the country , since ri@@ val@@ isi@@ tive groups are struggling to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ver@@ ized , two @-@ stor@@ ey mouse ole@@ ans for drugs , which are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the blame that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to murder .
&quot; first , in February the release of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have ref@@ uses the children , susp@@ ect speed members bought each copy of the output , as soon as they have been delivered to Tim@@ et@@ ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was not to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which had released the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived his friends and colleagues so he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as a senior re@@ por@@ ter for Nor@@ the@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to run journ@@ alism , without to encounter on the pre@@ dat@@ ory problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; in time , the newspaper served a reputation because of cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ter loved it , hard accurate investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories , which no one else could treat . &quot;
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists from the persecution of Mexican drugs , wherever they lead . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily to be that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drugs in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a lifestyle , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I do not want to be asked , &quot; &quot; what did you do about so many still@@ ers ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was living like a port worker , the friend , who knew generous with hu@@ gs and rat@@ ch@@ et , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always sit in El Salinas , the bar opposite of the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now ask them , was his love for the routine be his promise ? &quot;
&quot; his death also has forced them to ask her own assu@@ mptions in question , how they do their work best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their dom@@ ain@@ able Start@@ - and cross @-@ ways &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
to trust his own inst@@ inct .
&quot; if it smells wrong , keep away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , said the publisher of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say they are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas , VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ans , weak institutions and corrupt government at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly there were no mobil@@ es allowed . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside studied two polic@@ emen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ story district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the Scher@@ z , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked whether this officers belong to the 50 per cent of the police officers , that the Gover@@ nor was rather trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain scenery , where the drug gangs de facto under control . &quot;
for the output of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has dri@@ lled on three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending , focused on the hom@@ etown of the Gover@@ nor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group that introduced in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the State lawyers , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug retailers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ por@@ ters from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader , who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which dominated almost the whole century of all political levels . &quot;
recently several pron@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ level cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ por@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this eat@@ ery , including one , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; had escap@@ ed a military attack . &quot;
only a few months before the reader had seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body stat@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been re@@ directed to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , dedicated to the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something they have never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ ake a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office . &quot;
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared and three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is of it . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become more lou@@ der by making them written in organized &quot; SOS Press &quot; on hearing and construction . &quot;
&quot; on this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is located in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; in a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , on the day after ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez accused R@@ ami@@ rez the authorities , journalists , and bring them to release because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since then asked that she is once again divided by the government , because it is concerned that their hum@@ ility has wo@@ unded their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico from organised crime , they took part in government officials and a valid society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs but also on the command of politicians and security guards , organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico @-@ minded you , because they want you to be the mouth , &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a not@@ ebook that alleg@@ edly signed by the Z@@ etas Kart@@ ell , &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer sounds and ear@@ phones in addition to their se@@ perate head .
some branch have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as there is El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after ass@@ ass@@ ination of their direct director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez opened on the drug card with an editorial page on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have flo@@ wn out of their native states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and are looking for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they will be h@@ unted down , as it was obviously murdered by the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was ass@@ ass@@ inated with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay back and continue , it is a daily dance with risky choices . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives to that the drug control it start@@ led . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I was re@@ por@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was started on the side@@ walk before the office and tran@@ ches of beer , as at once all their phones began . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ en@@ riv@@ als and security guards near the bath@@ or@@ tes Maz@@ at@@ lan has left 19 confirmed T@@ ote .
the war escal@@ ated further as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the boarding @-@ edge @-@ edge they released the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via cell phone .
the introduction page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ s he@@ ed near to - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a view on the polic@@ emen , the guard held to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid of all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , the Mittel@@ finger for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a was visible , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its marks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only remember it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day he asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ ften its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue even though a terri@@ fying .
&quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nas@@ horn of a Canadian Berg@@ worker were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even find that his ti@@ lt skin of red@@ dish brown was - and they said , she could have had something of a &quot; &quot; in@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; presented him as &quot; the conf@@ essed din@@ osau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens in the world . &quot;
F@@ ossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs that lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well preserved state has researchers looking to describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ph@@ ol@@ oured plant fres@@ ser is the best preserved F@@ ossi@@ l of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed to be out of the surrounding rock at the board , and decided to see more accurately . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to exp@@ ose the wild animal within the 2.@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy cl@@ aws . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a little with the eyes blin@@ z@@ eln , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to see . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant fres@@ ser , although it is covered with an arm@@ aments and resem@@ bles a mut@@ ing tank , probably by meat fres@@ hen din@@ osau@@ rs was threatened . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ rests din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age , to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shi@@ el@@ ding technique that is known as a counter@@ part , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to blend themselves better into its surroundings and say its enemies , say experts what suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made its head@@ lines in May and is now seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta @-@ mit@@ ch@@ elli named after the museum techni@@ cian Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7.@@ 000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing maintenance of the specimen , it allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and form of shed and arm@@ our through his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ady , a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the const@@ ancy is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exce@@ eds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was liked by enough pressure through meat @-@ looking din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution was fav@@ oured the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of contemporary animals , which apply the counter sh@@ ady - think of deer , z@@ eb@@ ras or g@@ ür@@ g@@ inal - are much smaller and vulnerable as boot@@ y , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong sm@@ b@@ tier behavior on a massive , strong ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs be@@ asts must have been &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life , including its con@@ ser@@ ted intest@@ ine to find out what it has eaten as its last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , went out into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank in the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and Ocean@@ e are probably far more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ative skin , but also in three dimensions remains intact and the original form of the animal &quot; &quot; she said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost as much as it was in the early stages .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time , when huge ther@@ opo@@ lies , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ rests din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ unted by some of its fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Current Bi@@ ology appear , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was vers@@ ed after the death in the sea and in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the best @-@ kept din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have wei@@ gh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tops that rag@@ ed on his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ph@@ oned plant fres@@ ser caused by the Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater removal of the din@@ osau@@ rs kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
&quot; the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the skin @-@ tr@@ ams are still hol@@ po@@ ised tr@@ ams along the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko , written for National Ge@@ ographic , is such a level of preservation as &quot; rare as a profit in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I ans@@ ed , the more conf@@ using it will . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin cover still the b@@ ump@@ y tank @-@ plates that carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
&quot; his right front @-@ foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed by the top . &quot;
I can count the shoes on his sole .
in the th@@ under@@ storm : mass @-@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wo@@ unded
fier@@ ce accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wo@@ unded , long distances , and g@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age approximately 20 people have been in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; according to the first information of the police were at 5 : 00 p.m. between the junction , Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ storms almost 30 vehicles , including probably also trucks . &quot;
the exact number of publishers will initially have no information available .
&quot; it is very light to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a big break@@ up to rescue vehicles was at the exp@@ ir@@ ation place .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in direction to Munich .
a few kilometres in the Munich Residenz was signed a long way back .
&quot; as a AZ re@@ por@@ ter reports , it also came on the bac@@ kl@@ eway to massive disabilities - through numerous g@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
&quot; the fire@@ bri@@ g@@ ades not@@ ated the characteristic of the vehicle , who now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 then a second accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between a car racing and a car .
a Res@@ cue @-@ Hel@@ ic@@ opter was on the road for the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that has experienced almost everyone already : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or she is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the creation and w@@ akes an uns@@ an@@ ed or pull the g@@ ast in the middle of the work@@ flow .
ticket check .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently test@@ et the job @-@ free cycling control .
&quot; it is simply confirmed by mobile phone , that you have taken your place and will be upgraded to the ticket . &quot;
&quot; currently , a test run will run on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer goes , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it is then expected to be available on many other remote transport routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a train speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train the ticket card de@@ valuation without creation .
&quot; in order to use the use , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what already do most passengers do .
&quot; one has to have bought it via the app of rail , the DB Navigator software , which is the easiest type of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reserved .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : one climb@@ s in the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the test customer then appears a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the bike companion will get a message on its mobile devices a message that is located on the train and has taken the built seat Y .
comes the traction companion in the ticket check in place Y white he knows that a passenger is already sitting with already ent@@ angl@@ ed online ticket .
&quot; so you can still sleep , continue to keep on . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who likes to relax without ticket control through our traction staff , it tastes in the DB navig@@ ator just yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to shape their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of DB correspondence . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives the train , knows that next to delay and missed the ticket controls are among the biggest nu@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; because often one does not , in any case , but one of the competitors do not send all documents that you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the ID : or else a document , which you have to point out . &quot;
&quot; the result are endless discussion between mig@@ rating and driving , which leads to poor mood in the finish or large space and delays in controlling your own tickets and the activity at the end takes time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
even a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to the links ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further draw@@ numbers on the same track are not yet released .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &apos; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ?
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to their core .
&quot; just one day after having arrived at New York City , sitting in St. Louis Con@@ genital on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat , which they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and there is still on the street . &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one else had posted the information on their Fe@@ ed , she closed Facebook and opened on Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly praying on her Tim@@ eline .
&quot; the rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was there , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old that was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live on twe@@ et . &quot;
&quot; he posted an image of black@@ smith &apos;s alive , which was spread on the street and stay there four hours . &quot;
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell at himself . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people , the scre@@ amed , and of a man who claimed a sign with the wor@@ ding : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live @-@ feed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ish dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , escap@@ ed another polic@@ eman his ri@@ fle and cri@@ ed , &quot; I will kill you ... Animals all killing . &quot;
&quot; this is not custom@@ ary , &quot; reminded of Fer@@ rell on their statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and that we can call it typical .
in this moment I felt sho@@ ok .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would leave the next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , &quot; in the cin@@ emas on the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and the protest , of love and loss , strength and resistance , which is from the point of view of the people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , which took a fl@@ oral and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for fighting , what they believe ? &quot; do they remember what she said . &quot;
&quot; we go now to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happens today is a climax of what happened in the past .
you have to know it and it must be taken up and raised in it .
&quot; it needs to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also know the various layers of black experience and black constitution , and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she is personally not experiencing a bl@@ at@@ ant racism , it is no different from the next black women . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would like to show her a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
&quot; the first stop , when she arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was to a camp@@ ground as the activ@@ ist had waited for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began to embrace a new type of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell figure .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after the 9th of August , she said and noticed that she was at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urses Association and focused on eating fairness and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it all came . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rell met in an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the Co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; &quot; do you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; these scep@@ ticism has been nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited by their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his activ@@ ism around the death of his activ@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ ck@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we speak &quot; , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are depic@@ ted , because I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that it is in the movement &quot; &quot; not about a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show &quot; a surprisingly personal aspect of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life , as she loves herself and her wife mar@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ generation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells history has repeatedly the role of black @-@ tail women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which , after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as sul@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must wear the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it consists of that &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action , &quot; in the Fer@@ rell &apos;s identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who took this energy &apos; , she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because with a life at these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel her energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on are long gone , but the rac@@ ist links between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is for 2 ½ years due to rec@@ turing a highway in a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless it cl@@ ears to a vocals and she feels obliged to this memory , since then she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the street three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss over bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although it is far from being built . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south @-@ end of the pedestrian zone divi@@ des since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advocates and opponents .
cold leaves the subject hardly any .
on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; will be discussed .
&quot; while the one to say to the bit gallery : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; This would be real &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Festival ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; does not need a human &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ anks ) or simply &quot; &quot; Si@@ w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while supporters are building that a gallery attracts more customers in the city , of which the rest of the stores will benefit , are the opponents that then tre@@ ach the pedestrian streets . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery will be planned exactly on the property , on which the peasant market hall is available , where 13 Direct marketed products are available . &quot;
with the start of construction work will be concluded .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - and to the Bed@@ a place with opportunity to sitting outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the peasant market for many years .
&quot; mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lords were again very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for ourselves .
we would like to see that during and above all after construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether Direct marketed in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , it is likely not to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothing , shoes , dr@@ on or supermarkets : I find that super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
one can see how many stores will be empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but there is not even a decent weekend market , it is all the more important that us to at least get the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , is largely offered directly from the producer and is above all inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop@@ ke@@ epers are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , as the dor@@ sal renting are often non @-@ portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special stores there is almost no more and what is left there will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where should the peasant @-@ riding hall during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - also in duration when the bit gallery will eventually occur .
&quot; or does it offer the gh@@ ost bit gallery before , all shops from Bit@@ burg to distribute ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , also no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my view it would have been better to encourage a real farm market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peasant market it is possible thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ ess many - as I find - sensu@@ ous construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place more .
&quot; when the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ compar@@ ably identical - the on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist in He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tup@@ ers and H@@ ints that you were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ zer has raised a 35 @-@ year prison @-@ sentence , after being raised as secret diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ embl@@ ance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline , whose discipline , her professional competence in technology , computer science and art united , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama than he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg was created by the algorithms analysis of DNA , which could be extrac@@ ted by Mann@@ ing and could look out of 30 portraits , if someone can interpret with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ated determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing had been born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already talked about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 law@@ suits , including six violations of es@@ pi@@ on@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer and theft . &quot;
&quot; by the prison , her picture was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only a single photo - a gr@@ ind , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which cre@@ ing is inten@@ tionally sitting on a driver seat and a plat@@ former per@@ ch - with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; stran@@ ger &apos;s &apos; .
&quot; in this , the artist manufactured by stran@@ gers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cig@@ ar mu@@ te and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extrac@@ ted the DNA out of the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look . &quot;
that was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper ag@@ azin .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press tour of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were sent to un@@ equal spectac@@ les , which were recorded several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
they even inv@@ oked a from Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ str@@ ated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images &quot; who would fores@@ ee a future in which the President Chel@@ ation would change and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release was asked for seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ansas , was a welcome sort of happy coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp leads us a war against inform@@ ants from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ ez@@ ers to explore the rigi@@ d divisions that he actually should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange tim@@ ings of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery , written artistic statement demanded Mann@@ ing with its superior sub@@ title among them ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name is equipped with a heart ) an end of the automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis gender , race , sexuality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand feet from C@@ s and GS and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , to show the inclusion of 200 characters ( or nu@@ cl@@ e@@ ot@@ ide by the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological ways , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , so are the 30 of these stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room is one page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; it shows cre@@ ing , as it emerg@@ es with a free phone in the hand from the in@@ arc@@ tic bar@@ racks of the United States like King Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they put your speech , then they won . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; said the artist to greet people from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps , if I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was pres@@ ci@@ ent in the com@@ ic@@ book - but if they should do it then it will be greeted in the center of the room by their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ it@@ ars like hor@@ des of pesti@@ cides .
&quot; this was also targeted , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic fi@@ ap@@ log@@ istic groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed to Chelsea , like the movement , which was also hidden behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford because of killing
&quot; a nation@@ wide human hunting is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which had been sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday they were exhibited for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) Ar@@ rest due to its alleged participation in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Official Local Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
&quot; one of the police authority of Chicago published common warning system , that the loan was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injury to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still explained at the place of the event for dead , and det@@ ective exam@@ inations the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seeks after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them has been an extraordinary Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ es , Vice President for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them were now in be@@ ur@@ ped out and excluded from the campus of the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal issue that is investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ es . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ators for every conceivable manner .
&quot; the statement added , that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want it to be . &quot;
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , he said he urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip that had just happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it is unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the offering , and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic waste . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada timetable in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vi@@ cul@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
Russian Vi@@ cul@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ USA@@ DA has received the right to plan and test it in collaboration with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada timetable was updated in this regard , &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ introduction of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t have anything that could give concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list is noted , however , that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the results obtained from the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to con@@ gru@@ ent nation@@ ally sponsored by D@@ op@@ ings in Russian Sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos words agreed with those of Vital@@ y S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian outlets R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report has been disp@@ uted positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has before to accept this report uncondi@@ tionally , &quot; added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of the D@@ oping sk@@ and@@ als , from the carrying out of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the Organisation in Moscow in July W@@ ada @-@ General director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ USA@@ DA is moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be restored . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next u@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys are not working .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you owe anonym@@ ity , some workers dis@@ continued the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce H@@ air Care Society Madison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside to help .
a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is at the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ n allow the C @-@ Suite executives to handle and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Str@@ ava and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software tools is used by companies to measure our commitment . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap Sur@@ v@@ eys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat @-@ card of the company that indicates which units have most ail@@ ments and which managers have low supplement results - so that you can keep track of why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture have to be involved , so that you won &apos;t be the next u@@ ber who has published a blog post office , which describes an environment of evidence , in which those who have spoken , pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t is this wish for an overview a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
&quot; the Global Governance , regulation and Compliance industries could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value , following the financial website let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behaviour , saw an ascen@@ ding interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the u@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; convert nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , makes Conver@@ cent companies tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys send to collect sensitive answers in real time and see the warmth of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report a real behavior .
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints were directly related to the Super@@ visory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has seized the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his staff is treated badly or un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cot@@ t , worker @-@ cur@@ ation and pl@@ edges , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , convert Conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or email for the company central to submit a formal complaint and hope that he was seriously taken . &quot;
&quot; it was often an inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Conver@@ cent uses , can problems that have been hidden from senior managers that have been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or und@@ less practic@@ ality can be identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view in the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders in front of employment and employment . &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , values and employees in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took , until the &quot; Social Media &quot; came to their right , &quot; that companies knew that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and strain the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that exam@@ ines the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; convert $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ app@@ hire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which has raised the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ itz@@ ern secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , and brought its entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising considering the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s staff are more expected from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only assignments .
staff want to have the feeling that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to feel in a company that &apos;s yours , and that the work you are doing , then she felt stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In which both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; investors achieve return , if their portfolio companies are well run . company run well if employees are campaign@@ ing and engaging . &quot;
&quot; if the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on staff members are important according to the experts of the workplace culture .
&quot; however , the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , when an enterprise asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation , that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if changes does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments can breed and acc@@ entu@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 questions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , the company has seen too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow your employees , &quot; &quot; did you really hear me ? &quot;
to take care of it ?
and if you do not worry about why should I ?
&quot; Madison Re@@ ed , who now goes on monthly surveys , was able to initi@@ ate action on the same day when a problem about G@@ lin@@ t will be reported , so salvation . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to organize a new teams within the company by the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of arran@@ ging multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights about the staff , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond between workers in a sector which is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you are losing people , you will lose too . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it &apos;s going on 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercise fields of teams on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot@@ ted parts and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these unt@@ a minutes represent a lunch break . &quot;
&quot; players who are in@@ scri@@ bed to the summer , are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the Aqu@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday was closed . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed time plans of players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise comes from the two days is more than a day , at which the brood is moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ a six seasons in West@@ wood . &quot;
they are supposed to ab@@ ide in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; MOR@@ A said that he support the modification of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add a wide @-@ standing routes to the players another point of view . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it down , they plac@@ emar@@ ks themselves further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished , in view of the clear sight@@ se@@ wage of its fields from an adjacent parking and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which is already being washed with foot@@ stool , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a sp@@ ade that there might be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched that people rent a room and then setting up a exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ and from an exercise , it is a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ feit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fal@@ seh@@ ood to fac@@ ten@@ dence to third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , then the world &apos;s largest online @-@ social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so called f@@ ake News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website , that it will start with the use of updated machine methods metho@@ d@@ ologies to realize possible fal@@ cons , and to send them to factor check out of the original article . &quot;
Facebook was cri@@ tici@@ zed as one of the main points mentioned for so @-@ called f@@ ake news that many believe they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereas the French voters were floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany should support a plan according to the social media networks , if there were not to be able to eliminate h@@ asser@@ tive post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration on German that will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review . &quot;
&quot; besides the realization , which stories are challenged by the fact , the people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product manag@@ er for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook continues to test his feature on the &quot; linked article &quot; and work on other changes to his news Fe@@ ed to decrease wrong messages .
creating a com@@ ic strip : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney castle was to be seen in a squ@@ ee@@ ze @-@ music video and was a s@@ laughter house for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Mag@@ gia River Valley in K@@ ent and now is now for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos;@@ sp@@ ans lived from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented their families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emoti@@ onally . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b on the side of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ ag@@ enten in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is its thum@@ b !
&quot; and letters always smell to smoke , because at that time a fire was founded on the light of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he even though . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so with old papers is that he supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have been a little exagger@@ ated &quot; ) , this seems to be all too nice to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; New &quot; castle to explore the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed hy@@ enas of the walls and the bottles , spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated by the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ sc@@ ans , gar@@ dener , and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank a whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access in 2006 as the last Er@@ am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive that he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats told &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; books books , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , those who represent what poss@@ essed , &quot; &quot; said Rhodes , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to view to bre@@ vel@@ er base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who built the newly built castle to get to the farmer up of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that came to 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ fe Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farmer has started in this area and I thought , an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the story of the Jes@@ u@@ it &apos;s , who hid the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell was shown from the 18th century , having filled his own funeral , by having a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only years later , when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen are seem@@ ing g@@ aun@@ er to be always debt and spend money on things they could not afford .
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men delet@@ es their debt crisis , by married old women - I imagine them as a p@@ ile of well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to spread Er@@ bin@@ nen . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle Rhodes is in search of other unique scre@@ am experiences .
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ ders , the grounds of a san@@ atorium on the early 20th century , which has been back since the nature of nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; ah , now I have to be done with the dam@@ n life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the cover of the 301 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign for the introduction of a new roof . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his Marketing Team for Nelson Art@@ z want to hold the logo and the slogan secret . &quot;
at the end of August it should be the highlight of the campaign on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; asking the creators of the action since yesterday on the poster at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write it on their yesterday released website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
&quot; and to make clear that man@@ is better , than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we as the Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer &apos;s citizen to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in the action , it is more than just a logo and a slogan , it says further . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all@@ ein@@ ous promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able all@@ rounder . &quot;
&quot; finally , it stood in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a mid @-@ dig@@ it amount is the town of Bad Honnef and its new Dach@@ stein and the campaign .
military re@@ forming in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
every year in early August consul@@ ts in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) across Pen@@ sion@@ ings and carriage in the officer .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
&quot; but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the meeting took place in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the official seat of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; the proceedings under the presidency of the government now took the five fourth recipes , as well as the Minister for Defence , Home , Justice and Ex@@ ternal Action . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians of the Y@@ as were in the number . &quot;
the government moves the military to the military .
&quot; General Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the host , of air @-@ forces and the Nav@@ y have been demol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; since the failed cou@@ ps , President Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als have been consolidated . &quot;
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of inn@@ ed connections to the movement of exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who looks the Erdo@@ gan as a wire .
&quot; for 486 people who should immediately have been participating in the coup , this week in Ankara is being negotiated in Ankara . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of God as a &quot; divine gift , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan does the army really bear under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hürriyet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; accidents in the military @-@ headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the general manager there were concerns , because of an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , which manifes@@ ts itself in the abolition of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the grand@@ master at the army and the security guards goes on .
&quot; mid July Erdo@@ gan was left by Dec@@ ree more 73@@ 95 citizenship , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 54@@ 6 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed to be Erdo@@ gan &apos;s military as Erdo@@ gan .
the gener@@ als formerly known as the actual men of the country .
three times they called appeal to her role as guar@@ dians of the world@@ ly state .
&quot; after his election of 2002 Erdo@@ gan led the power of the military step by step , not least by calling for the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is targeted towards the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; V@@ oc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; had not been an endor@@ sed officer after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; if this is , such a development could not let Nato fail . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is no doubt available in the alliance after the inf@@ ants of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , commented President Donald Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited from the media . &quot;
&quot; he faces , reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for the issu@@ ing of vis@@ as for a fixed working permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is said to be discussed in the two chambers of the congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty reduction , increase wages and billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by the US to change the way the citizens from other countries of green cards are issued . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will come to good , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited from the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to tie @-@ to @-@ tie track for racing
over the past few months over the future of the racing boo@@ klet has been sl@@ ed - now it is very quick to go .
&quot; even before the end of the year , on the mar@@ ten circuit , on which the tourist car drives , are built . &quot;
&quot; to secure the future of the racing boo@@ sted in the long term , we are to start working on the track according to information provided by the Ministry of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , conf@@ esses the country above all for the tourism , &quot; stated Traffic State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of over@@ hau@@ ling the route he rose to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the land will take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Treaty on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future of the country , I definitely will finally be coordinated , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen train as an operator has already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; thus the timetable , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tr@@ aded , &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for eleven years for a period of eleven years .
thus the race side@@ walk @-@ shuttle can be ordered in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is one of the most popular rail links between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the past few months , the course of a pilot farm has been tested , whether the route is used by sufficient many people to order them in the future . &quot;
the circuit is also very strong in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought , in 2017 it is not yet crazy , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , in fact . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) report a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ fied Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the She@@ ff@@ ield University and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to begin to take their ascen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the ey@@ color of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; Mr Shar@@ key said in the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex doll@@ s have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a si@@ lic@@ as that feels warm - with aware human reactions which can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robots even according to his beliefs &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot to the type of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still disturbing , as many robots had the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; , &quot; that would let a st@@ eppe @-@ woman look progressive . &quot;
modern sex @-@ doll@@ s have developed into robot with a si@@ lic@@ on .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robots allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics , which they find as promising as for example . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the True Comp@@ ani@@ on developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conv@@ eys the impression of pup@@ il and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted as good as possible to your personality as well as possible , war@@ med the website of True Comp@@ ani@@ on . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she does not like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day her m@@ oods - like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can &quot; be &quot; in the mood ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female qualities , the inv@@ itations to rape , if one gets a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( meaning here : contradic@@ tory ) Far@@ rah , be@@ ween the most of the most . &quot;
on his website True Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men then do not have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is stated on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex player . &quot;
their formation and their increasing refinement point out on something dar@@ ker and deeper understanding in our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation as an optional addition .
&quot; most men will of course hold no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ marked their growing popularity , they remain provisional on the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what flow out of the boundary zones , in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or animated , until they have the free market to do so . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a certain over@@ cuts that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time where the rights of women are threatened around the world , in which there has been a president in the White House who has pra@@ ising women to have sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most aw@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report &apos; The Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the encrypted body and the stolen eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although with porno@@ star @-@ pro@@ por@@ ections ) .
their buil@@ ders want them to make human feel that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , on the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , the robots represent no real women . &quot;
you can not separate yourself from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or a background history , nothing , which hin@@ dered on independence or anything that could inter@@ fere with the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
otherwise expressed : they are counter@@ part slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the in@@ comprehen@@ sion of the healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a bin@@ ess of the Tru@@ mp @-@ era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate , even families in the small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to cope with the horror of Tru@@ mp &apos;s relatives . &quot;
we all alleg@@ edly produced us all in order to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; even less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this , because my C@@ ousine , a lef@@ tist poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been visiting with the republi@@ cans in our family , who visited me this week in New York . &quot;
they remembered that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can relationship , with which they fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and very peculi@@ ar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; in order to the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it is related to me that this will also be significant risks associated with it . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gray possibility that we no longer break up his toll for one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a still start@@ led long @-@ time scenario , in the tru@@ mp republi@@ cans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alised &quot; that suddenly appear in comparison with its standards suddenly as in@@ comprehen@@ sion of denial . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s strange version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least , we knew how he saw his tax declaration ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact occur as a very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate the Republi@@ can only be spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify as in@@ im@@ meas@@ ur@@ ably improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my C@@ ousine was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ uss@@ les of New York Park@@ department , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if there is no caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fiber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all the cl@@ owns and the animals revol@@ ve to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark , and the clim@@ atic music conv@@ eys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disappointing : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not justified to the dream . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five years later , and I am still not entirely across the day when I found Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the topic pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park @-@ carousel is still a strange experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ he can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have seen the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one has been asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option that valuation with a 15 % drinking money at the same time - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slo@@ ping of what is actually a neutral exchange should be , but also practice pressure on the server to put personality into a situation where no one is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor wife in the department store was exc@@ itation exc@@ eed@@ ingly , while I made tired of experience to reach her my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital .
&quot; last year he was brought to hospital due to the treatment of cuts in the hospital , which he suffered the pris@@ ons , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned according to murder in favor of an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors to the first nec@@ essi@@ ties .
he car@@ et@@ ched Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by passing them several times through a door of the toil@@ et@@ ine in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria on her .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night in@@ tru@@ der , who hid himself in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time to appeal against the six @-@ year imprisonment of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal , by which they say they may be too si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; the national criminal prosec@@ ution said that they will rise in the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us runs danger that his sentence increased to 15 years , when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no penalty in South Africa .

&quot; but the hope to make out of him a chicken , the eag@@ le spread out on a high mountain its wings and escap@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; the her@@ es dances with the young Go@@ ck@@ le , the cylin@@ ders to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Adler stand for the integration , said T@@ ail@@ er Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is unlike the other young animals ( chic@@ ks ) , but they belong . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
&quot; his purpose is to be free . &quot;
&quot; in every quarter , you wish that he feels in his new school . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the colleagues , the former deb@@ tor of Michael Müller , who repeatedly le@@ ased once again in teaching , and the par@@ ental representatives . &quot;
&quot; die Kü@@ ken@@ zeit is now over , the class teacher Sophia Schum@@ acher . &quot;
they leave their students after two years of teaching only very strong because it was a really great time .
&quot; finally , they can rely on the districts of the district . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all the students had to sound a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
the children broke great joy with the children .
the new school year already registered for the first year .

&quot; on the same day they were released , while currently an examination is running . &quot;
the State Department reported on TV that Bulg@@ arians later released .

software update for diesel cars : what they need to know now
how exactly can the software update instead of ?
do diesel drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the gas @-@ behavior of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europa gives ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents :
is the new action compul@@ sory ?
no , the supported software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ ann software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has been arranged the motor office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a fast implementation in the coming months , but there is not yet an accurate appointment . &quot;
Daim@@ ler has shared to write every person concerned .
&quot; if any inspection may be charged , it will be done within their framework . &quot;
how long should the change of change come up ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
it depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen voluntarily , the car manufacturers have not been doing so far from the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
&quot; time @-@ consuming could be , an appointment to get . &quot;

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
&quot; the first prize will be awarded with President Tru@@ mp , politically to become politically . &quot;
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is first of Rap@@ ture a of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution on Thursday announced , this year includes the Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograp@@ her in Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman LE@@ AR ( 95 ) . &quot;
we are handed over the awards at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding . &quot;
the prize winner of the Progressive TV series announced that it is already announced to rel@@ inqu@@ ish the g@@ ala to take part in the g@@ ala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New York Times &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - to them even the funds - and that ent@@ ails me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 year old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to make their point of view . &quot;
the Kennedy @-@ Center named after the former President John F. Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
&quot; among the former winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city lively
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes in the coming year in R@@ ente . &quot;
the passage is already written - suitable applicants are r@@ ar .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister
&quot; and work is still great fun , as he conv@@ eys in the press . &quot;
&quot; he reports of varied , but also challenging tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
at the same time wondered that so far there is no application for the requirement .
the city is trying to get an architect or engineer at the next time .
this way - taking account of the regular periods of cancellation - even enough time for a development .
&quot; since Has@@ l@@ ach acts for the administrative office as sub @-@ law authority , the applicant has to be corresponding to the applicant . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they could not fill them out , they would have to go for advice up to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but Bür@@ g@@ ern@@ ees , the city and himself is important , says W@@ acker who reported by a good business li@@ ma as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; over 30 years in office some significant projects have accumulated , the che@@ acker can look back with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city lively , he is sure about the building office and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects on the agenda : the design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ stage park@@ .
the kin@@ dest bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed although the stadium is still subject .
&quot; the latter alone will strike with approximately EUR 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; If we &apos;re doing it right &quot; , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
gest@@ alt be there for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister large margin .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own construction and gar@@ dener can be quite flexible to react .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants are often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is as ensemble from monument protection , whether it is important to have an eye for what rein@@ suits , &quot; if re@@ constructions are approved , stresses the schei@@ der Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is the client , &quot; at the end everything is going here over my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been living since ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Deep @-@ bau ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; even though his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who wants to truly identify and remain in place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good business li@@ ma , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; who would like to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , the course of the town of Has@@ l@@ ach was able to present a complete study as a diplom@@ in@@ genie@@ ur or Bachelor in with specialists in the areas of construction and planning . &quot;
&quot; the municipal office under@@ stand high @-@ quality and deep @-@ building , construction planning , atro@@ city areas , administration of urban areas , municipal work@@ places with Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ g@@ ärt@@ ner@@ ei as well as sub @-@ law authority including monument protection . &quot;
bike on pipes : southern ground locked
&quot; according to police , the previously un@@ known perpetrators had the blue bicycle from the rail@@ road over@@ pass in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) thrown into the lea@@ der@@ ships . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the her@@ edit@@ ary freight train had to be hal@@ ted .
the investig@@ ators go from two male men@@ ters and look for the night hours after them .
near the Tat@@ ort had been observed by witnesses a ros@@ ar@@ er sco@@ oters and a bike @-@ driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ st@@ reich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA . &quot;
&quot; or the offen@@ ders would have brought themselves into great danger , and also the tension is at risk . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the complex as well as the late &quot; &quot; delays &quot; &quot; and the costs of rail transport could also be pun@@ ctu@@ ated by rail customers to the perpetrators . &quot;
&quot; in total , be excluded from a &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; sum , &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ line could be run without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten person@@ ages were Friday afternoon , two of which amounts the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; spre@@ aders were not falling out , but they were bel@@ at@@ edly . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged approximately 200 metres of upper lines . &quot;
the insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , milk products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflamm@@ able bo@@ wel disease ) to lin@@ ders &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study reveals exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with infl@@ amed intestinal diseases might be . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million and in Britain 30@@ 0.000 , causes magn@@ ets and bl@@ ouses , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ als , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; in the person concerned , meat and dairy products are ste@@ ep@@ tive to rel@@ ieve their symptoms found researchers at the Washing@@ toner University , that contributes to the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol , to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hiding in the body , do not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells , which are capable of compens@@ ating inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body , without sensitive tissues to be as@@ ham@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; in experim@@ entation has been determined that a type of tolerance is applied to mice , that occurs a certain bacter@@ ium in their entries . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins and the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food had , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he proposed that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ate toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel disease , if the same system is bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ do@@ kt@@ or@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an studied a kind of immune cell that promotes the tolerance , when she found out that a group of cur@@ ators had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe but that had not been accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oma of mice , the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the stomach @-@ intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ är@@ me of mice , DNA sequ@@ encing and there were six bacterial species available in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing with mice . &quot;
mice were raised in an ster@@ il@@ ous environment so that they did not develop a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not developed this type of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; to understand how the bacteria should grow on the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then over@@ led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were ins@@ ulated by the mice . &quot;
the immune @-@ cells developed into toler@@ ated cells .
&quot; as the active component of the fluid has been cleaned , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers have double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells rose by around 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ go@@ ings have been hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ on stated that people have the same toler@@ ant con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ fac@@ et products made by L. reu@@ ter@@ i the cells in men develop as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to a extension of this population .
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; says Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut on S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million Po@@ unds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last Pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressive in the oral role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , MAT@@ IC had been excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia @-@ Tour of the Blues and managed only 45 minutes , which had to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho launch his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed in this week , that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had another new obligation , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic work , &quot; three of his four prime ministers . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given themselves great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. automobile manufacturers Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the Rad@@ par@@ atro@@ men the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole thing was a break @-@ out for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; thus , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo has been painted into the sky . &quot;
&quot; new woo@@ p for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
&quot; however , like the wind blo@@ ws : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD @-@ Chief Prime Minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; just no stor@@ fire from the party central , merely no head@@ wind from the covenant , so the most important desire of the elec@@ toral fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed , the fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees of the Willy Brandt @-@ Haus has been monitoring the events in the SPD @-@ ruling national capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , the head@@ wind would not even be described in the approach . &quot;
there were underground .
and indeed one after the other .
the federal CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Nieder@@ sachsen a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this one shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be sure , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber from the editorial network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
the surprising frac@@ tion@@ ment of a Green @-@ Parliament has led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a difficult crisis .
five months before the farm vote his red @-@ green coalition lost its A @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party of the Green Party of Michael Kell@@ ner has promp@@ ted the Ab@@ ün@@ de Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ ables requested to return their mandate .
the transition to CD@@ U means a clear for@@ gery of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ets must immediately return its mandate , &quot; &quot; said the German business leader and campaign lad@@ der of the Green Party Network of Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true all , si@@ ghing out a SPD vote , than on Friday afternoon the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ amb@@ assador reached the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands after crossing the green MEPs El@@ ke T@@ asi to CD@@ U without its own govern@@ ors . &quot;
it is the provisional peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD @-@ state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland elections in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ ming himself down the com@@ rade . &quot;
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia everything will be different .
this was then too - and it all became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel , the SPD brought the SPD to the sc@@ am , the Düsseldorf @-@ bank@@ rupt , the party smooth . &quot;
lab@@ orious r@@ ages down the comrades in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then when she had just had a new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ summit of Hamburg arrived . &quot;
and he came with him the next woo@@ fer .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
and because he did so much all in the crisis communication after that which one can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z struggles for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ gas @-@ gas and its role in the Super@@ visory Board , the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Prime Minister has already stood in criticism . &quot;
mi@@ ese con@@ formity came to added .
&quot; nevertheless , or maybe this reason , Wei@@ l tried to put more and more strongly in the covenant in the past weeks . &quot;
&quot; the desire of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , has also not been hidden from Martin Schulz in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him give him a stabil@@ isation of the party in Wei@@ l .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could enter . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party internal constraints , the Green Gre@@ ens is basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz didn &apos;t even say .
&quot; ein@@ st@@ les , the comrades try to keep the own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger depends on the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the tr@@ ams of parliament@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs T@@ ens puts their own career food on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Party Left in the SPD German Bundestag , the Edit@@ transaction Network Deutschland ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; MS Mid@@ west has not been elected to parliament because of its person as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , so the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische MPs continues . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they return their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD German Bundestag , lam@@ ents a &quot; &quot; democratic Man@@ ö@@ ver &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate before four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann who leads the Dutch SPD to the German Bundestag , the R@@ N@@ D . &quot;
&quot; now fal@@ si@@ fy the personal career of a future CD@@ U members , the W@@ ah@@ ler &apos;s result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called to clarify the background .
I want to know if more or there has been more pl@@ agues of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen

who wants to extend his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler there were once again looking back on the events previously .
since 1991 it has been held in delicate refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; back then , in the refurb@@ ishment I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg has adopted two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment II from 2005 to 2016 , the grants was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for s@@ in@@ dler the previous re@@ visions are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote inner development , and not only close new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , you will receive the information from the Karlsruhe Presidency on April 4 , that there will be a refurb@@ ishment III . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ vey@@ ing sum of 833 euros , of which would be more than 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the municipality received . &quot;
how does a re@@ organisation comes now ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area in general interest , to san@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territory may have to postp@@ one another . &quot;
the pier contracts on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; the cellar presented the contents of the federal government &quot; Social @-@ Programme &quot; , &quot; which would then be carried out in its frame . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of interior cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would object in object , which means per plot . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment would eventually be defined as stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for the funding runs from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2026 .
&quot; even until September this year , however , the inventory would only be carried out , within the frame of those who were able to fill out a questionnaire to fill in the retro@@ fit area . &quot;
&quot; in November or December the pro@@ posi@@ tional order must be carried out as possible , so that in the coming year with the mark@@ ings can be started . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every Comm@@ une will carry out the pl@@ ague of advance @-@ investigations .
&quot; it is about to evaluate and decide the urban planning of the city , and decide when re@@ mod@@ elled and to what extent . &quot;
it will then also be entered into the basic book for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come again and make a picture of the situation passed away .
&quot; Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of those involved . &quot;
&quot; therefore , questionn@@ aires will be posted to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building of building , &quot; in which it is related to the construc@@ tional state and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; can be made information about size , distribution and residents of a living room . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; blue &quot; &quot; arch &quot; &quot; is only to fill if in the building areas are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , it is noted that Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed out that the distribution of the funding after the &quot; &quot; wind storms &quot; &quot; - who first comes , re@@ membran@@ es first . &quot;
you can not book any promot@@ ers for later &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Locations II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a rehabilitation &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip in order to arrive with a hand@@ ball in the home and car
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open its door@@ step , enter his office and can even launch his car . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ on , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and foref@@ inger now offering the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has performed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aesthe@@ tist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ ant micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr North@@ am also wants to change the castles in houses and cars , that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , to fly a nav@@ y helic@@ opter for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month , costs tax pay@@ ers according to the information of the military that have been issued to the T@@ IME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House took a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ opter @-@ helic@@ opter was issued in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House required the presence of the helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter found on the South La@@ wn , following the records of the Marine Hel@@ ic@@ opter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted that you are aware of this because it &apos;s an un@@ common event with high visibility is , &quot; wrote the com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event its front , the dep@@ uty Marin@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helic@@ opter arrived on 17 July at 7 am in the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 pm , and so long stayed until the la@@ wns between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening was given . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team needed for the return trip . &quot;
&quot; the original flight care was during the event at the helic@@ opter , while the san@@ itation of unity during the time remained on the ground by plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by the T@@ IME were not clear , if ultimately a second air conditioning was necessary . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits local ownership for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the appointment .
&quot; a question we asked , whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; rep@@ lied the dep@@ uty command@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was referred to by the White House as official event and would not be covered by H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus for reform of the health reform , which was in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to contain the government &apos;s regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the plane that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual . &quot;
Tru@@ mp was conducted in February a investigation as the presidential plane in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ Services and his Twitter account is full of announ@@ cements that describe themselves about the use of the presidential aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products made from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty Pres@@ idential Secretary of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often perform training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn by setting the U.S. President in the White House with precise c@@ timeters in cen@@ timeters .
&quot; as a Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House 58 exercises . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event in the training needs of the aviation for the month , said an official . &quot;
helic@@ opter @-@ units additionally flew 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential implementation . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other Re@@ qu@@ ires , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company had not been involved to get the helic@@ opter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not present budget design@@ ations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Ministry of Defence for the year 2017 , the DO@@ D equipment is valid for the V@@ H 3D but 24.@@ 380 USD per hour &apos;s hour . &quot;
records of the unit record the flight time of the flight than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virg@@ ina .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of running the helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for the refund is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to an R@@ AND study from 2015 , the refund has not included the costs for DO@@ D , but consider the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time the former pres@@ ses@@ si@@ cher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state , Connecticut very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I am assum@@ ing that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to elev@@ ate the result . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether tru@@ mp with the helic@@ opter inter@@ com@@ pressed when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the seat of a fire@@ man . &quot;
in the White House Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of the tricky task
top rated of the Second tennis Bundes@@ liga joins the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ dor@@ fer SV .
the TC blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ ent Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
&quot; despite having five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance , the top leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga has received the sense of reality . &quot;
teamwork Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; especially on the rear , I find the crew very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV primarily ensure the imports from the high north .
&quot; their plans and fin@@ s can even refer to assignments in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with view on Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Sweden ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas Bj@@ er@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; that is as always hard for us .
&quot; you also need a good serving happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the Trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; this is currently not currently in the Chall@@ enger @-@ game in the Italian Bi@@ ella , active Fr@@ ench@@ man in the Italian Liber@@ ec game , comes the tournament in Czech Liber@@ ec Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for its first use in this season . &quot;
the hitherto un@@ defeated ch@@ ill@@ nik ch@@ ill@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the white @-@ rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski even at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the ball .
&quot; he should also be in Kiel , but also like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ es@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; following his two victories on Sunday last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could turn again into the team again . &quot;
&quot; enough for the 18 year old Hungary , which was in January 2016 still the number one of the Jun@@ i@@ ores World tr@@ ang@@ list , does not fill someone out of the trainer at Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the K@@ ader . &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tru@@ mp does not really happy than on Wednesday , his signature under the law on the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his h@@ ast to en@@ acted the law , the Congress introduced a few &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; , &quot; he estimated . &quot;
&quot; the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels has fo@@ amed against the US leadership . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft is to pun@@ ish European companies that help Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors of domestic O@@ MV are since then funded with other European companies to build the Russian Baltic Sea North Stream 2 . &quot;
the dr@@ ones is violent .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil business . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions against the executive order of an executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; &quot; has been viewed , which could deny the Group and which could really do it . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the Hit@@ ti@@ x series at the center of Net@@ fli@@ x .
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo of Es@@ co@@ bars k@@ iller is un@@ vei@@ led , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the Stre@@ aming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest Bob@@ se@@ wich@@ ed of the Show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed their attention to the richest organisation of the world trafficking : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une @-@ 500 company &quot; only with more state bri@@ bery and violent actions . &quot;

roll back@@ wards : the city poses 46 ch@@ k@@ enh@@ il@@ fen
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban kinder@@ gart@@ ens the clock is turned back .
&quot; on September 1 , the town Kre@@ feld is taking over the food supply in the urban kinder@@ gart@@ ens care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ reg@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , acting leader in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; we all enjoyed very much . &quot;
&quot; bo@@ iled beyond house , a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh bo@@ iled . &quot;
&quot; the city runs in the Kre@@ feld area of 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens , in 44 get the children for lunch time a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; by now we eat not only children who are cared for 45 weekend in the K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies to 35 @-@ hour care when children stay up to 14 pm .
&quot; 46 participants from the 1st of September kitchen service : you have warm the angel@@ i@@ ded dishes , complement them around salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , clean off , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group installations as well as seventh facilities - decides on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen@@ ware now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; thus they are much more involved and it is easier for the K@@ ital@@ ist simpler , educational concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is about healthy nutrition and cooking .
the kids will help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is because sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - will be done in the future of special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , it also has the charm that it turned out into the cost between self @-@ reg@@ ie and foreign policy for the city as the most economical , it is by the press . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces will be re @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at approximately 750 people in the educ@@ ator range not so strong in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , &quot; says the UN
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , the veterinary director of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are en@@ cap@@ ac@@ ing in the provinces . three women run for the role of Vice President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
&quot; &quot; &quot; a trade union would like to meet with managers from the Bis@@ cu@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow . &quot;
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has failed to weigh about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ Cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cu@@ its .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union officials would be first experienced when their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the managing director of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s , &quot; to express concerns that the funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be prop@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ Cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here , and the workforce focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ xit , the rising of life costs and of the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently to urgently table production of production at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; the branch office at T@@ oll@@ Cross has only yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly since we estimate continuous engagement with employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives in T@@ oll@@ Cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we deb@@ ated with the staff that we are active as all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our stores continuously check and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ Cross as a production site and completely to change . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona has been war@@ ned three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not given in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar since she has given an offer of £ 189 million so that they have war@@ ned over three years before the world war ?
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has stopped the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record for more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive players in the world and for the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out to the outside , although a source is near the Catal@@ ans pro@@ vocation , that the club has always been his best to take care of his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 to take care of it since his arrival . &quot;
but the football world was war@@ ned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this view ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 , interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i converted , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried , because they know if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign in , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish Association had expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G clearly did that they wouldn &apos;t permit it to the International from Italy , under some circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese is seeking the police witnesses .
&quot; because him ent@@ ail a car on his driving track , the driver had to rec@@ ede a VW Tour@@ an , and tou@@ chi@@ pped the leading plan@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was coming to the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction to Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the plac@@ enta of Stol@@ zen@@ au came to him a passenger on his driving track , so that he had to turn right to the right . &quot;
here tou@@ chi@@ pped the tour@@ an @-@ driver the leading plan@@ ke .
at the passenger there was no harm .
&quot; the driver of the opposite truck , a Mercedes Benz , had out@@ dated a truck and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; it may well be good according to the in@@ genu@@ ity , that the merch@@ ant cyclists had not noticed the accident at all . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Review un@@ load Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report on the ab@@ abuse of Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the ab@@ usive sc@@ andal over the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussion .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; &quot; We are Church , &quot; &quot; declared by the former Reg@@ ensburger Bishop and today Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ kt X@@ V@@ I. , an excuse . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have expressed deep regret on their own om@@ is@@ sion or their at that time false assessment of processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; however , cri@@ tici@@ zed that in the reporting of violence in the cathedral @-@ cats with &quot; two different measure . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in terms of over@@ gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no doubt that it would have to be sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; u@@ pri@@ ming , but the &apos; degree medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; says the author in Luc@@ etta Scar@@ af@@ fia , histori@@ an and a member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the day @-@ day experience , and is preparing public opinion that is normal for normal &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ af@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; in Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is , in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; you would like to go to the church and that is a strengthened fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; saw a quite normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; , &quot; to cope with friends as I was one , ready to finish . &quot;
it &apos;s unfair to use today &apos;s standards for earlier decades because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of the ab@@ norm@@ alities he often visited Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; completely wrong , says author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann , who recorded with R@@ atz@@ inger mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; says E@@ emann , &quot; because all that had nothing to do with him , he adds the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report that took charge of the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber presented ?
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; &quot; with high Pl@@ au@@ si@@ bilities &quot; &quot; victims of over , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , that was applied by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be viol@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other def@@ endants , many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases , despite violence even having positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview E@@ emann , who explains the final report for the abuse of the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; &quot; inci@@ dents of violence &quot; &quot; with the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for a lift , many students raise his &quot; &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ er@@ ker and perfec@@ tioning that has become tangible , when a cathedral @-@ sp@@ atz has no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his Bi@@ ograph of this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : once you read the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger does not happen at all . &quot;
he has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly spoken of any suspic@@ ion of the medi@@ ator or co@@ wis@@ er in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
&quot; also , the non @-@ violence at the pres@@ ch@@ schule is outside of its impact . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to take it to it , too late , or have not taken the first cont@@ amin@@ ants seriously . &quot;
&quot; the cathedral eng@@ ages school , on which he did , was received by virtually all respon@@ dents as - as literally - &quot; rede@@ mption &quot; , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus , the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes it as &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; honest &quot; , &quot; &quot; honest &quot; , &quot; &quot; honest &quot; , &quot; &quot; honest &quot; , &quot; &quot; honest &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; comprehen@@ sible &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tionist and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to W@@ ut@@ ro@@ ses too . &quot;
&quot; he did not only bo@@ died with chairs and the mu@@ zzle and laid down on the ground , but also ear@@ nest@@ ing guys to the hair or ears , he himself had already given years ago , deeply regret and exc@@ used for it . &quot;
&quot; to its honour , however , must be said that such educ@@ ative methods were widespread in the frag@@ mentary period , the 1960s and 1970s , widely used to parents like with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; also , I have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state @-@ Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the ent@@ able sexual abuse and non @-@ violence on the pres@@ ch@@ schule , are the fre@@ est@@ ly bag@@ at@@ ella . &quot;
you ask yourself whether it is not more likely to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ V@@ I. that many media have just rus@@ hed to him .
&quot; on the Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood him , still free@@ zing . &quot;
but the truth is : the report bur@@ dened Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every sense !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report a lot about the issue of abuse in the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also placed any trans@@ ference or co@@ zin@@ ess with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very much no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual over@@ gri@@ ps claims to have become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugur@@ ated .
&quot; I never aw@@ aken me to talk with my father or mother about it , &quot; he said a beg@@ ged assistant for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims are silent .
&quot; if they do not even familiar with parents and bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral conductors that would have been a colleague of the offen@@ ders . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ pupils R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers play a role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a respon@@ dent disciple wor@@ ded it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any event in which he would have had to susp@@ end ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely insights and would have been able to hang out the offen@@ ders .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that there are no more urgent or more clear or more likely to be opened compared to their parents , dormit@@ ories , confidence etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; in this way , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that in advance the students involved in advance and / or their environment , could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free from any fellow @-@ knowing .
he cannot be accused of him or have not prevented him or to show him .
&quot; therefore , there is also no reason to connect his good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as it was unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; non@@ violence &quot; &quot; was to be read with the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the earlier Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown out in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the great problem that in the coverage it was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the midst of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this again is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; namely clean , there is clean apart : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the high school of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence as well as , we say once , other represent@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report dealt with inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir conductors of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole horrible check @-@ in , the cases where Kn@@ aben of s@@ adi@@ sti@@ cal teachers were regul@@ ated and mal@@ ef@@ ed , ex@@ propri@@ ated himself on the pres@@ ch@@ schule in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states must be healed . &quot;
&quot; but with whom , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys only to face , when they were already on the cathedral &apos;s place . &quot;
&quot; on that was , like most witnesses emphas@@ ise the subject &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ schule &quot; &quot; t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; it was only happy to be escap@@ ed and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states . &quot;
what was different in the domain of the building ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline , but just a Canadian force . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at the most still the accus@@ ation , to have taken away . &quot;
&quot; despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ schule . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself straight and was responsible for a school , at which he was not acting and responsible ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
En@@ oss Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently in the ears consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral eng@@ ul@@ un , which the report was even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in that he points this point , &quot; &quot; that in the primary school the test will continue to be practiced . &quot;
&quot; at the face of the danger negative presses recommended , it is recommended to progress . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time when it was legal clarity , as exam@@ ining in Bavaria too long ago . &quot;
&quot; before , it acqu@@ ets itself in a legal gray area , as everyone of us are still white . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate heavily , where the affected individuals might be exagger@@ ated or dramatic and where really the per@@ missible border had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but one cannot say , he has always been removed . &quot;
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the exam@@ in@@ ward sentence was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too .
&quot; princip@@ als Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards at the time . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we speak there from the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger , the past of today &apos;s moral leaders . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has already been right .
&quot; but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ omin@@ ous at all times , and also not for what has been ban@@ ished in primary education and violence against im@@ min@@ ent children &apos;s rays , which goes far beyond that way . &quot;
this is all quite aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally working .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection because all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; its means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ ching and pul@@ ling to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as physical punishment , then he was strictly prohibited . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Reg@@ ensburger time , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has given the talks to you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ? &quot;
did the topic examine the test also in terms of language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I didn &apos;t mean that he carried out there a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once again : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the un@@ solic@@ ited un@@ condi@@ tional discipline , it would be hardly possible to form an institution of world tran@@ scen@@ ding , true cultural botan@@ ist Europe and his musical tradition , which went just twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) on tour . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not make any big singers and before each success stand for whatever area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , and again and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , sincere and warm @-@ good people , from which one could not imagine doing something even a fly . &quot;
&quot; I am coming regularly with , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ zation , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treated him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not forgive him today that he was once more strict to them , they are clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; most of the cathedral @-@ cats are grateful to him today , that he enriched her life and has made them the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he always was a good , v@@ esti@@ al teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but still a loved respect was to which they still have a look and which they go straight away . &quot;
&quot; and please , again , once again , everything you imagine , are educ@@ ative methods that were then on the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just one man , just because it is promin@@ ence and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al s@@ inner bu@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention that stands behind it , only too apparent . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eved him . &quot;
&quot; now the rush @-@ up was , a 93 @-@ year man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , and maybe Germany no one would probably know the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
