<seg id="7">"everyone knows everyone who had to rain himself already, because the Auto-Navi was taking place in a radius street instead of a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of Geoportals Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but currently - but therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when one compares them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then clearly, the cities and communities in the spread-area of the Münchner Mercury has changed since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a makestry I see as such is not equal.</seg>

<seg id="15">The French Heerleaders occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Koalitionof War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical survey of Bavaria to order - naturally for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops arrived with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, there were today's neighbours that created the idea of a surface-covered Bavaria card."</seg>

<seg id="21">The city has grown into all directions and has grown up.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subverling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was published 21 years after creation of the map, so 1877, as a Münchner district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today subverling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are located at 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when Hineinzooms appears a smaller map with dozens of dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered plots from the so-called" "urine" "out of which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots do not occupy there today no farmers more - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in the Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is characterized north of subsendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 showroom of the October Revolution, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century."</seg>

<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended for example the Ankhing of the so called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he is not allowed to use the staff to apply violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has engaged in an exhibition with the Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients there was first place, later was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity is no longer a result - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists in Germany."</seg>

<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was at 1856 as" "Head", "the purchase street was called" "Kaufinger Gasse." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change took place during the Second World War too.</seg>

<seg id="50">Citizenship group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured states has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory politics and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force by the state, demanding Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourianer, as a number of questioning, racial cases occur in the whole state and here, it is stated in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes it harder to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution bodies of the State, the disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to raise the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that happen to men.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are halted for their skin colour, they are assembled or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear discomfort in such an incidence, which we have not yet heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents like racist arrest against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in fragile circumstances beginning of the year after having no gasoline's journey through the state, and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by Missouri Office, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People have to be ready to bring Caution-money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri signed up in 2015 100 Hassan in 2015 according to the latest numbers from the Hassenbrew reporting program of the FBI that defines the state with regard to the number of such violations at the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"travelling is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it harder to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union had issued before the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), after the states of immigration laws passed, people to migrate because of immigration law, which will contribute to the view of ACES to further rents."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but in the last time interest groups has been used as a reaction to specific laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Pasture project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisheraun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Peter White and Kordula Kovac started a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right-grabenhof of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the fisherman CDU town, together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann gave first insights into its operation, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and also houses many kittens and houses in five apartments Feriengaeste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "black milk" "is for him the alternate marketer way for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he marked the Weidener project as" "elementary". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot act on such a steep land.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green surface for a lot of work, a lot of nuts will be dealt with with the Motorsense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been here with the conditions and with the topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the elicable operation and managed this without chemical-based pesticides and fertilizers, even if it does not lead to biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" the Commune has recognised the importance of the White project, and is pleased with the Leader of the leaders. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the expense of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare, farmers must be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "I hope that the forestation of the areas could be pushed aside for quite a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure that we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how to continue their operation," "said the Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in criticism due to promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">More than 25 plots were fenced in 2013 by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the entertainment surface is 40 hectares, which can be kept up to at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 Euro, half of the leader was being promoted, a quarter contributed to the community of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers hiring 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of wheat."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," stated Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac said:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and landlords, it does not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter White stood:" "here best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscans (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of pastors.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the disclosure of the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisites is the presence of one of the LPR signed.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fence should not be sleditable (Hanging over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisherman's ordination project, 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the entertainment surface is equivalent to 35 hectares, the cold costs are more than 112 000 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transfer is to carry out the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the restoration of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Place in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly what he did when he took a symbolic struggle by Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the president to the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller handle not the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators could have suffered it if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid their significance, and in particular the meaning that you have been written when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta immined:" I don't want to enter into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that glows the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem on which you refer to that later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly capable of properly, but as he formed it itself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the emerging words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your exhausted, your poor, / your bedranged crowds, who longing for afterward to breathe free from the elding waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time, in which the" miserable waste "on our screens was better to see."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not get involved in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after her death on the basis - did so good that they have accomplished a high-political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by portrayed the female embodiment of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminine coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed, the people of the right wing wanted to switch it long for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a sort of Johannes of the Illusion for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is nobody longed, but rather an early Neoconservatives that bring the American flame into the umphed world:" Lady Liberty goes ahead. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to bear the torches of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something stolen.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and at all a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted to see them as they were of the exhaustive, miserable, but hopeful humans after long and often terrible travel to the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it's in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people, seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump will ever recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black loides Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle recalls itself at a time when only two villi had belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member accounts will be a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland a little special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom have to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue it until we find it," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of the circumstances is absolutely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes have medals there, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - that will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m track, while Eiliie Doyle was elected from the team to the team's team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feel, the Eilidh naturally brought forth, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth-Silver medal winner, who is playing at the 400-m hurdles in the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 rots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes on the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-cycle-runners Muir leads to this path and has five British and two European recruits last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5.000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another shot, which you should look after a great season, which was included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">"Doyle recalls itself at its first world Championships, when the only other flotto in Team Lee McConnell was."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the teams leaders say that they are" huge "of the fact that many of their land men are not only part of the team, but in some cases even with the medals and with the finalists."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be in this team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor to know that my team mates voted for me and have chosen me, makes it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we got.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes, who want to rise to Podia."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech concerns as a captain in particular?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it's going to be a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics about Facebook: Bewirb does not block you to take a public office when you cannot wear the heating of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew a bit of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers swallow him because of all, from domestic policy to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He shipped in criticism, safe. "</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not bring his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783 Washington said," "the speech of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we will be guided like the sheep to the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on how Washington must be."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defendant him this beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the stab of the Governor did the lawsuit was called frivol, and the online comment was full of a return campaign with" "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a Republican governor in a stunning democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the highest approval of the 50 Governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzring.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his State and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with its electors and playing his haired head after chemotherapy on its side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the rectiation of individuals who come to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokesperson Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governor and argued that the blockage of comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolles or spammers or hammable people, who vibrate online the Peitsche."</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, not trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not profited."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyers at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserted, but she asked to break Hassan."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented polite, that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news, she wrote in the commentary box of the message" "The Post". ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are disregarded by some rather than a collective collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the associates of the Governor was" "focused spam attack", "other probably would be called" "providentials". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to heap a message by blocking a critics or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, when you have done the same that employees were disposed to collect newspapers with critical control, and to burn or protesters and to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what is happening.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is minted by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell to Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisas, the last Amendment of the Loudoun County, the last Amendment, according to U.S. District Apostle James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they registered a voters from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so heavy.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous lettering on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyme like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions. "</seg>
<seg id="202">"petition that criticise his position on the contract of amity, the trade and navigation of the UK criticized his office, according to the historical documents, which were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not lead them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreements and discourses belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept.</seg>

<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, took part in 2014 by a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof for the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something that was similar to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have fallen in love with them and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square kilometres was completely outdated."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a A-room estate with a welded layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Stauber and a mezzanine to use the generous cover level.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"this was my request," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose they made the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5-feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine which you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative thinking to release the encore.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is rather complicated," "explained."</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were flooded, without that we had to bear."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or at the bottom."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement enabled it to place Erfan, two rooms in full height - with lots of extra drama."</seg>

<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in addition to theatre, space and light. "</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends is a short corridor mirrored to let him take longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance mirrored units place for all the bestseller and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"by the perception of a glamoury space, the beauty of living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went out there," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, furnified MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is quite important, so it is when you slide the door very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the cleverly use of space and storage space, Joanne could win extra 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or as your property is valued," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate makler will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the ground floor and use high quality materials, which provide the room to its luxury advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not forget you into the electric plugs at the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"it shows that an apartment can turn out into something quite admirable by a good design and increased square kilometers."</seg>

<seg id="1364">A jurisdiction that implies that Colin property has the value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul as a problem.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new Stabschef is planning to limit the media-abstinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and are failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Stabschef of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to president Trump, including reports of the news media - in the hope of keeping the head on a more uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Stabschef of the White House, met at his first working day with leading employees, he presented a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wool up: bad information that fall into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">"Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow, whether on paper or in briefings, because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information."</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to pimp Trump by monitoring its media diet."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship with television is sufficient for centuries - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if Candidate was angry when a unfair coverage was angry, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince," said the former electoral adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to hold Trumps Twitter's habit under control, according to six former electoral campaign, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that Trumps Twitter will ever" "under control" "is ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campagneners don't know what we don't know - that Trumps Tweets would have to contain even more pointer without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never experience something about the tweet that Trump has not been sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff made it a few times, tried to follow him away from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"but nobody has consistently prevent it, that Trump has been highlighted."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, which consists of competing parties always try to present their own agenda by bringing Trump material that possibly promotes their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this history - reported in May about the preference of the consultants to dubious information about strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged Lecks and that he will find out how these come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"precisely this happened at the end of February, when someone was a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Stabschefin Katie Walsh," the source behind a bunch of leaks to be in the White House. "</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was banished because of chicks permanently from Twitter, or that he has no concrete evidence offered or that he voiced false accusations in the past and revoke them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"he added that the former Staburef Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, 'tried to deploy a system to manage the paperwork and document the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsives Self, and his consultants are still seeking influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair for US President Donald Trump is intended to have approved Robert Mueller according to a report a so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the panel has recorded the work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote under appeal to the matter of familiar people."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper examines the step as a sign that Mueller has extended its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the sender CNN reported, there are already first demonstrations in the body related to a meeting between Trumps and a Russian Ombudsperson."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies complaining the Kremlin for a longer time targeting specifically in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there was agreements between Trumps election campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of investigations, several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republicans."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"finally, Mueller accepted more and more trumps private and business environment among the magnifying glass."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special investigator has moved to the center in front of a few weeks, and I am looking for the accusation whether the President in the course of the affair may hindered the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand Jurys is to check and decide the evidence in possible failures, and decide whether indictment should be charged."</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called charges.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when it is bigger and controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>

<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the replacement of the body at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the president on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia-history is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>

<seg id="1508">There is no reason to accept that something was changed in this statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">"but Mueller was only used, after Trump Comey had been repented."</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this ragmeric, accusations were loud against Trump, he used to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him for a setting of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>

<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"how the climate change has played a role in the breakdown of ice, is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"overall, there have been a series of uncommon breakthroughs in the region, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factor background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be combined with the warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The Koloss was now a part of the Larsen-C-Scheldels.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Scheldels floats on the sea and is fed by major glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is thus growing constantly into the sea and breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelsols is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Scheldelses was the balance of waxing and breaking down a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Scheldelis be there and writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"I speak a lot about it, that also the Larsen-C-Schelsols in danger be, because the forward-edge candid have never withdrawn as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice-plate under tension and can be broken, if at a key place a piece brake."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Scheldels and Eisberg does not increase the sea level as it pushes on the water and pushes water as much water as it is after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the Scheldelusion leads to the glaciers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only in the slippery degree, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctic (MIDAS)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelsols is after AWI-data with almost 50 000 square kilometres the fourth biggest Scheldels of the Antarctic.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front-edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it's a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change, the ice sign comes into a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most widespread withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists have been controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelsols will now grow again or long in the long run, and perhaps together, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though this researchers fall back to the breakup of this gigantic iceberg, does not fall on climate change, so in the past few decades many kingdoms of the Antarctic Peninsula are falling apart."</seg>
<seg id="1546">"this long division of Antarctica, in direction of South America."</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey the ice surface of the Antarctic peninsula has gone to 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>

<seg id="1808">"Krämer, Zünons, dealers, vagant or a land of land are to be experienced in the inner city these days."</seg>
<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The managers of the weekly Riodoce are normally brought together to review their plans for the reporting of recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars. "</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">"it was told to them, that it is important to change their routines."</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: you should take their children with the office, who were the target of an attack with granulates, or they leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and stomach."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug regulators, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected to stand on the salary list of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no retirement from violence, and during all the land the corpses, are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto began in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, their editors and their inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of its numerous books on violence associated with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack becomes deeply felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, which indicates the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, who will be his smiling face with spectacles or his typical Panamera."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmare, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 is a Sonder-Federal Prosecutor's office, in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with the most thousands of murder that are linked each year with drug and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely placed in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are untruneast and although the terrain is now even traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to wasting my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we smashed all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May Valdez has left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks far before its roter Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men and 12 times he was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with" "twelve" "river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap went away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly free in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest last year and delivery in the United States in January was Sinaloa, one of the most bloodiest battle areas of the country, since rivalisitive groups are struggling to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of verized, two-storey mouse oleans for drugs, which are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget about a minute that there is a state of" peace "if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the blame that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartels in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have refuses the children, suspect speed members bought each copy of the output, as soon as they have been delivered to Timetkioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was not to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper which had released the same story to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived his friends and colleagues so he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as a senior reporter for Northeeste, when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to run journalism, without to encounter on the predatory problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"in time, the newspaper served a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising revenue."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it, hard accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories, which no one else could treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists from the persecution of Mexican drugs, wherever they lead."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to be that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," "he said at the time of the CPJ award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drugs in Sinaloa" is a lifestyle, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I do not want to be asked," "what did you do about so many stillers... why did you not say what went before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team miss Valdez, the fun-bird, who was living like a port worker, the friend, who knew generous with hugs and ratchet, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always sit in El Salinas, the bar opposite of the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now ask them, was his love for the routine be his promise?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also has forced them to ask her own assumptions in question, how they do their work best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their domainable Start- and cross-ways" to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">To trust his own instinct.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, keep away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, said the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is happening with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say they are in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, VERACRUZ, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smugglans, weak institutions and corrupt government at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly there were no mobiles allowed. days before has been known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside studied two policemen protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-story district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked whether this officers belong to the 50 per cent of the police officers, that the Governor was rather trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain scenery, where the drug gangs de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the output of this week Riodoce has drilled on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the state spending, focused on the hometown of the Governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that introduced in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the State lawyers, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug retailers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporters from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader, who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), which dominated almost the whole century of all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several proni governors were accused of high-level cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this eatery, including one, in which a son of" El Chapo "had escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before the reader had seen the Kolumne of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "" El FLACO "" because of its slender body statur. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has been redirected to the storage space for signs and stickers, dedicated to the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something they have never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"reporter Miriam Ramirez snake a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist to the office of the prosecutor's office."</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared and three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is of it."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become more louder by making them written in organized" SOS Press "on hearing and construction."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day the director Bojorquez is located in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"in a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa, on the day after assassination of Valdez accused Ramirez the authorities, journalists, and bring them to release because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since then asked that she is once again divided by the government, because it is concerned that their humility has wounded their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico from organised crime, they took part in government officials and a valid society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs but also on the command of politicians and security guards, organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>

<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez opened on the drug card with an editorial page on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have flown out of their native states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and are looking for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they will be hunted down, as it was obviously murdered by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was assassinated with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from VERACRUZ."</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic the pholoured plant fresser is the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed to be out of the surrounding rock at the board, and decided to see more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2.500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy claws."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only have a little with the eyes blinzeln, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to see. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs specimens - the mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant fresser, although it is covered with an armaments and resembles a muting tank, probably by meat freshen dinosaurs was threatened."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly arrests dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage, to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique that is known as a counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to blend themselves better into its surroundings and say its enemies, say experts what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made its headlines in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Borealopelta-mitchelli named after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing maintenance of the specimen, it allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and form of shed and armour through his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shady, a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the constancy is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs was liked by enough pressure through meat-looking dinosaurs, that the evolution was favoured the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of contemporary animals, which apply the counter shady - think of deer, zebras or gürginal - are much smaller and vulnerable as booty, which signaled that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong smbtier behavior on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs beasts must have been", "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life, including its conserted intestine to find out what it has eaten as its last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went out into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank in the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and Oceane are probably far more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preservative skin, but also in three dimensions remains intact and the original form of the animal" "she said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost as much as it was in the early stages.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time, when huge theropolies, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta lived, the arrests dinosaurs was hunted by some of its furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta was versed after the death in the sea and in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the best-kept dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armaments, and is completely from the muzzle to hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long tops that raged on his shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="1964">But the underwater removal of the dinosaurs kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the hidden remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the skin-trams are still holpoised trams along the dinosaur."</seg>

<seg id="2014">"either the credit card or the ID: or else a document, which you have to point out."</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result are endless discussion between migrating and driving, which leads to poor mood in the finish or large space and delays in controlling your own tickets and the activity at the end takes time to take care of other concerns."</seg>

<seg id="2024">"confused, because no one else had posted the information on their Feed, she closed Facebook and opened on Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly praying on her Timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the territory of St. Louis was there, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old that was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., killed, live on tweet."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"he posted an image of blacksmith's alive, which was spread on the street and stay there four hours."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," thought Ferrell at himself. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweets over people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people, the screamed, and of a man who claimed a sign with the wording:" Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live-feed in which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a bellish dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, escaped another policeman his rifle and cried," I will kill you... Animals all killing. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not customary," reminded of Ferrell on their statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and that we can call it typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">In this moment I felt shook.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would leave the next morning to Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "," in the cinemas on the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and the protest, of love and loss, strength and resistance, which is from the point of view of the people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, which took a floral and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for fighting, what they believe?" do they remember what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go now to Ferguson, because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," "Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happens today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You have to know it and it must be taken up and raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it needs to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of black experience and black constitution, and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she is personally not experiencing a blatant racism, it is no different from the next black women."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would like to show her a bad service to keep them away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop, when she arrived at Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was to a campground as the activist had waited for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to embrace a new type of activism for Ferrell figure.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after the 9th of August, she said and noticed that she was at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating fairness and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It all came. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met in an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the Co-director of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to Ferrell in mind:" "do you document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"these scepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community that benefited by their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"with the then co-director Damon Davis had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around the death of his activism."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Brockery."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we speak", "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are depicted, because I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is in the movement" "not about a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" Whose Streets show "a surprisingly personal aspect of Ferrells's life, as she loves herself and her wife marries."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the degeneration of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells history has repeatedly the role of black-tail women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, have shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as sulul."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must wear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it consists of that" this is not a affirmativer type of action, "in the Ferrell's identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who took this energy ', she said."</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because with a life at these cruises as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel her energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson are long gone, but the racist links between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is for 2 ½ years due to recturing a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home:" a mess. "</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless it clears to a vocals and she feels obliged to this memory, since then she went into Ferguson the street three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size wahn": TV-readers discuss over bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit-gallery moves the people, although it is far from being built."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south-end of the pedestrian zone divides since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any.</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to say to the bit gallery:" this would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" "This would be real" "(Nicole Festival), comes from the other side:" "does not need a human" (Siggi Banks) or simply "" Siwahn! "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while supporters are building that a gallery attracts more customers in the city, of which the rest of the stores will benefit, are the opponents that then treach the pedestrian streets."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery will be planned exactly on the property, on which the peasant market hall is available, where 13 Direct marketed products are available."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction work will be concluded.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - and to the Beda place with opportunity to sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been buying almost weekly in the peasant market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlords were again very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to see that during and above all after construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" whether Direct marketed in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, it is likely not to be low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what's shopping list in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, dron or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many stores will be empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but there is not even a decent weekend market, it is all the more important that us to at least get the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, is largely offered directly from the producer and is above all inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shopkeepers are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, as the dorsal renting are often non-portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special stores there is almost no more and what is left there will probably also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where should the peasant-riding hall during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - also in duration when the bit gallery will eventually occur.</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or does it offer the ghost bit gallery before, all shops from Bitburg to distribute?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, also no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view it would have been better to encourage a real farm market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market it is possible thanks to the wahness many - as I find - sensuous construction projects in Bitburg no place more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost incomparably identical - the on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist in Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupers and Hints that you were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyzer has raised a 35-year prison-sentence, after being raised as secret diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline, whose discipline, her professional competence in technology, computer science and art united, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama than he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey Hagborg was created by the algorithms analysis of DNA, which could be extracted by Manning and could look out of 30 portraits, if someone can interpret with these genomic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the indurated determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning had been born as Bradley Edward, but has already talked about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 lawsuits, including six violations of espionagegesetz, computer and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"by the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a grind, black-white selfie, in which creing is intentionally sitting on a driver seat and a platformer perch - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012 project 'stranger's'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist manufactured by strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigar mute and chewing gum by extracted the DNA out of the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when they received an e-mail from a newspaper agazin.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press tour of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated Muse were sent to unequal spectacles, which were recorded several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even invoked a from Shoili Kanungo Illustrated Comic "Suppressed Images" who would foresee a future in which the President Chelation would change and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning release was asked for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome sort of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads us a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweezers to explore the rigid divisions that he actually should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timings of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery, written artistic statement demanded Manning with its superior subtitle among them (the" "i" "in her family name is equipped with a heart) an end of the automatic fragmentation, whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet from Cs and GS and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, to show the inclusion of 200 characters (or nucleotide by the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazing, at least in biological ways, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, so are the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room is one page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows creing, as it emerges with a free phone in the hand from the inarctic barracks of the United States like King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech, then they won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote me," "said the artist to greet people from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps, if I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was prescient in the comicbook - but if they should do it then it will be greeted in the center of the room by their own genomic simulacitars like hordes of pesticides.</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where their genetic fiaplogistic groups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted it to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed to Chelsea, like the movement, which was also hidden behind her liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotionally."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought, in 2017 it is not yet crazy, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, in fact."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible robotics) (FRR) report a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritified Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we have to begin to take their ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eycolor of the robot, its shape of nipple and the type of fingernagel."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," Mr Sharkey said in the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicas that feels warm - with aware human reactions which can be achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robots even according to his beliefs" "and select everything from the eye-color of the robot to the type of nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still disturbing, as many robots had the" "personalities", "that would let a steppe-woman look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex-dolls have developed into robot with a silicon.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robots allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics, which they find as promising as for example."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of pupil and" Wild Wendy "with a" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted as good as possible to your personality as well as possible, warmed the website of True Companion."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she does not like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day her moods - like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can" be "in the mood!" "</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female qualities, the invitations to rape, if one gets a step on Frigid (meaning here: contradictory) Farrah, beween the most of the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why can men then do not have a Roxxxy?" it is stated on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not only a fetish or simply just another sex player."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their increasing refinement point out on something darker and deeper understanding in our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course hold no sex robots, and while the FRR remarked their growing popularity, they remain provisional on the edge of the consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what flow out of the boundary zones, in relation to the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strange or animated, until they have the free market to do so."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"however, there is a certain overcuts that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time where the rights of women are threatened around the world, in which there has been a president in the White House who has praising women to have sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most awful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report 'The Magd') are not the graphic images, the encrypted body and the stolen eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornostar-proporections).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to make human feel that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, on the point, when it comes to their" personalities, the robots represent no real women. "</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can not separate yourself from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or a background history, nothing, which hindered on independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission."</seg>

<seg id="2431">They remembered that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the Republican relationship, with which they fought for decades due to politics, suddenly and very peculiar on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"in order to the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it is related to me that this will also be significant risks associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and Trump, we refer to the gray possibility that we no longer break up his toll for one day."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is a still startled long-time scenario, in the trump republicans of the right wing" normalised "that suddenly appear in comparison with its standards suddenly as incomprehension of denial."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's strange version of the madman - the dog on the Autodach, the 14% income tax (but at least, we knew how he saw his tax declaration) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur as a very mild criminal offences."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate the Republican only be spiritually healthy to qualify as inimmeasurably improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my Cousine was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Carussles of New York Parkdepartment, and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if there is no caffeine."</seg>

<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million and in Britain 300.000, causes magnets and blouses, recurrent or bloody diarrheals, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"in the person concerned, meat and dairy products are steeptive to relieve their symptoms found researchers at the Washingtoner University, that contributes to the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut patrol, to ensure that harmful microbes that hiding in the body, do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells, which are capable of compensating inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body, without sensitive tissues to be ashamed."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experimentation has been determined that a type of tolerance is applied to mice, that occurs a certain bacterium in their entries."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the components of proteins and the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice in their food had, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and an in tryptophan rich diet tolerate tolerant, less inflammatory bowel disease, if the same system is buzz."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes the tolerance, when she found out that a group of curators had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe but that had not been accommodated."</seg>

<seg id="2594">"the Därme of mice, DNA sequencing and there were six bacterial species available in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing with mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in an sterilous environment so that they did not develop a intestinal microbiome and they did not developed this type of immune cells and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria should grow on the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a fluid and then overled small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were insulated by the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune-cells developed into tolerated cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the fluid has been cleaned, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-Metabolism that is known as Indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers have double the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells rose by around 50 percent, but if the tryptophangoings have been halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragon stated that people have the same tolerant conducive cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach-intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-facet products made by L. reuteri the cells in men develop as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptopical values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to a extension of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2890">That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abusive scandal over the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weider, spokesman of the reform movement" "We are Church," "declared by the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the emeried Pope Benedikt XVI., an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger would have expressed deep regret on their own omission or their at that time false assessment of processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" "Osservatore Romano", "however, criticized that in the reporting of violence in the cathedral-cats with" two different measure. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in terms of overgrips in Regensburg, no doubt that it would have to be shameful and shameful acts" upriming, but the 'degree medial manipulation, "says the author in Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and a member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the day-day experience, and is preparing public opinion that is normal for normal" "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"in Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" you would like to go to the church and that is a strengthened frescoes. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" "saw a quite normal pedagogical means", "to cope with friends as I was one, ready to finish."</seg>
<seg id="2899">It's unfair to use today's standards for earlier decades because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of the abnormalities he often visited Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who recorded with Ratzinger memorabilia" My brother of Pope "(translated in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," says Eemann, "because all that had nothing to do with him, he adds the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report that took charge of the diocese Regensburg with the enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber presented?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were between 1945 and early 1990s" "with high Plausibilities" "victims of over, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, that was applied by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be violated."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims are estimating the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases, despite violence even having positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Eemann, who explains the final report for the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the" "incidents of violence" "with the Regensburger Domspatzen" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for a lift, many students raise his" "humanity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a cholerker and perfectioning that has become tangible, when a cathedral-spatz has no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his Biograph of this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: once you read the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger does not happen at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly spoken of any suspicion of the mediator or cowiser in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"also, the non-violence at the preschschule is outside of its impact."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to take it to it, too late, or have not taken the first contaminants seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the cathedral engages school, on which he did, was received by virtually all respondents as - as literally -" redemption "," "heaven" and "better world." "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus, the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also describes it as" warm "," sincere, "" honest "," "honest", "" honest "," "honest", "" honest "," and "" comprehensible "," "" sincere, "" biscuits and Bonbons, and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about its perfectionist and its high emotionality, which also led to Wutroses too."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only bodied with chairs and the muzzle and laid down on the ground, but also earnesting guys to the hair or ears, he himself had already given years ago, deeply regret and excused for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to its honour, however, must be said that such educative methods were widespread in the fragmentary period, the 1960s and 1970s, widely used to parents like with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"also, I have experienced this in a worldly school, a state-Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the entable sexual abuse and non-violence on the preschschule, are the freestly bagatella."</seg>
<seg id="2926">You ask yourself whether it is not more likely to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI. that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, still freezing."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report burdened Georg Ratzinger in every sense!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report a lot about the issue of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also placed any transference or coziness with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very much no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual overgrips claims to have become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never awaken me to talk with my father or mother about it," he said a begged assistant for the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they do not even familiar with parents and blings, then certainly not a choral conductors that would have been a colleague of the offenders."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-pupils Ratzingers play a role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a respondent disciple worded it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any event in which he would have had to suspend (Georg Ratzinger) timely insights and would have been able to hang out the offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that there are no more urgent or more clear or more likely to be opened compared to their parents, dormitories, confidence etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report comes to the very clear result:" "that in advance the students involved in advance and / or their environment, could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any fellow-knowing.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of him or have not prevented him or to show him.</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is also no reason to connect his good name with these contradictory crimes, as it was unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media much of" "nonviolence" "was to be read with the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The earlier Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown out in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that in the coverage it was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the midst of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this again is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely clean, there is clean apart: between the preschool and the high school of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and nonviolence as well as, we say once, other representations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report dealt with incidents from the period since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir conductors of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible check-in, the cases where Knaben of sadistical teachers were regulated and malefed, expropriated himself on the preschschule in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states must be healed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys only to face, when they were already on the cathedral's place."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, like most witnesses emphasise the subject" "preschschule" "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"it was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" heavenly "states."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the domain of the building?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but just a Canadian force."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims are estimating the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases, despite violence even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at the most still the accusation, to have taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschschule."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself straight and was responsible for a school, at which he was not acting and responsible (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Enoss Georg Ratzinger consistently in the ears consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral engulun, which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in that he points this point," "that in the primary school the test will continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at the face of the danger negative presses recommended, it is recommended to progress."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time when it was legal clarity, as examining in Bavaria too long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before, it acquets itself in a legal gray area, as everyone of us are still white."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate heavily, where the affected individuals might be exaggerated or dramatic and where really the permissible border had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one cannot say, he has always been removed."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the examinward sentence was officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"principals Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed yes, it is unfair to apply today's educational standards at the time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we speak there from the" pitfalls of anachronism, "thus the danger, the past of today's moral leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is of course not true for sexual abuse, who was abominous at all times, and also not for what has been banished in primary education and violence against imminent children's rays, which goes far beyond that way."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite awful and I am glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection because all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"its means of disciplining and punishment, so earching and pulling to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as physical punishment, then he was strictly prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburger time, Georg Ratzinger has given the talks to you for the book" My brother of Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic examine the test also in terms of language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the Domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I didn't mean that he carried out there a stricter regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once again: without this perfectionism, without the unsolicited unconditional discipline, it would be hardly possible to form an institution of world transcending, true cultural botanist Europe and his musical tradition, which went just twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone, one does not make any big singers and before each success stand for whatever area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger on their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger, and again and again as a wonderful, humorous, sincere and warm-good people, from which one could not imagine doing something even a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I am coming regularly with, like many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his Emerization, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treated him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgive him today that he was once more strict to them, they are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"most of the cathedral-cats are grateful to him today, that he enriched her life and has made them the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, vestial teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but still a loved respect was to which they still have a look and which they go straight away."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, again, once again, everything you imagine, are educative methods that were then on the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust one man, just because it is prominence and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial sinner buck."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention that stands behind it, only too apparent."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just released, relieved him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the rush-up was, a 93-year man who had acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, and maybe Germany no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
