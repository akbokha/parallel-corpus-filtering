Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made clear the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambig@@ uous .
&quot; I will always put in drawers , or I get glu@@ ed from the outside label that usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I do not have the desire , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ ness &quot; .
&quot; most of the evening , the actress spends her time at home , a TV with loose Dut@@ t and Mexican food , is it in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; they bring the question of the children &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; we have to not be married or children to be perfect , &quot; so the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love Is Not a Children &apos;s game &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the film works with us on August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sports Pyram@@ id
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a bit of variety with some colleagues a bit of variety with a walk on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Spor@@ ts@@ ky &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes the horses reminded of their fes@@ sions , they said in the fast g@@ allo@@ p home at home to the feeding . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and with this the gar@@ be@@ ers ended up then again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament win - back close to horses .
&quot; he left himself with his family on the facility of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he didn &apos;t let go on a horse . &quot;
it was the first time in Aachen and therefore at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe transferred to the man from An@@ hausen within the frame of a small g@@ ala the Golden Sports Pyram@@ id .
in awards it lacks the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; Bundes@@ wehr kreu@@ z , Silver nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already led him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
at Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means to me very much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social engagement . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 Euro equal . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding spor@@ tsmen , the two @-@ two master@@ y master was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
&quot; among the excellent include the Ath@@ eni@@ l@@ ete Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ real Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the Spring@@ se Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the palms of all Erhard . &quot;
many of these athletes came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative Society went to the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ azza price ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policies compared : it &apos;s all about the money
we invest in infrastructure and prevent the TT@@ P trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two U.S. presidential seek@@ ers are however at the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; the differences in the economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , more philosop@@ hical , more philosop@@ hical . &quot;
&quot; the , on the role of the state . &quot;
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt a bit of small and war@@ ns how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; Clinton wants to put the economy to death and regulate , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself would be completely different , claims tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely drive regul@@ ators , and he sets up for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private busin@@ ess@@ men and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton says : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes for the rich would increase , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; to be invested in the nuts , say tru@@ mp and Clinton almost wor@@ t@@ ably . &quot;
the democratic application announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly adher@@ ed to the Republi@@ cans of the Republi@@ cans .
&quot; thus , in Tru@@ mp , they could also offer cross @-@ party discussions . &quot;
&quot; more evident , the differences in energy and climate policies . &quot;
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power stations and resume the coal reduction in the US .
&quot; oil promotion is also intended to be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement will give up . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to strengthen and demand the renewable energies with its investment programme , &quot; &quot; a country becomes the super@@ power of the clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements the two competitors is not too far from each other .
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , do both not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US would not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs . &quot;
the plans are to be paid even better for about Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger strike .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what tru@@ mp does not want to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ally , then he says he is not likely to be changed . &quot;
&quot; however , the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps . &quot;
&quot; on one hand stands tru@@ mp , which wants to boost the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics stick to him , so that the budget deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand Clinton is Clinton , who want at least demand the rich , that they pay more taxes , and their critics are saying , more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; any fl@@ ashing woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is one of women who fl@@ ee alone , almost to everyday life . &quot;
when they arrive in Germany they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen are four women sitting .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in the arm .
he kn@@ itted with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother sti@@ ff on the table top .
until they noticed that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene acts normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance offers in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are whis@@ per@@ ed .
they live in Mün@@ ch@@ ner north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe . &quot;
&quot; however , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men there are no - as well as visitors .
the exception is a wax in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made upon their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men escape because wars because they will be politically prosec@@ uted , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as a hop@@ pers to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country , they have experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , hon@@ orary murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end once they anch@@ oring in Germany , ir@@ re , tells us . &quot;
also here women in Refu@@ ge@@ es would often be considered inf@@ eri@@ or and wor@@ sen if ab@@ used .
&quot; this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in the residence in Mün@@ ch@@ ner north , traum@@ atis@@ ed , appreci@@ ates it . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not made voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women were so normal that they have nothing to say .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; since they often do not help you know , there are more accommodations only for them , ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether they are from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are such a thing in the area of governments not . &quot;
&quot; even in pigs , women are not accommod@@ ated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are some common floors or separate houses for women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament is calling for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study that has been published for the committee , it is : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it may come to - on @-@ going - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women find this protection to be felt , you can deri@@ ve the j@@ umped on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since she has been talking around , we have a long wa@@ ist , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
it could easily be a second home .
Assi@@ stance wins : demands for new labour @-@ fight measures
&quot; dep@@ uty of the Assi@@ stance , their trade union were called to make new working amp@@ ut@@ ations in their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) , the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded his entire council , from the beginning of September more labour @-@ amp@@ ign@@ ment measures . &quot;
J@@ DC said that Minister had administ@@ ered minister to address the concerns regarding the contract .
&quot; assistance and medical students have agreed in July through the rejection of a contract , which was agreed with BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted among the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was posted on Thursday evening on Twitter , said the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government was &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently &quot; &quot; to problems that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; in view of the J@@ DC Management Board coordinated the proposed new contract , reject the proposed new contract , reject and off@@ beat official new negotiations for all of the issue . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the Government , the J@@ DC Board today made a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a continued program escal@@ ating working amp@@ f@@ measures , which starts in early September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that Assi@@ stance in the year of sixth strikes , the first overall waste in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana occurred after the election to the ref@@ us@@ al of the agreed contractual conditions , which were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he divided BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote through 54.@@ 000 assistance and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote said the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of aliens &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and an official end of the eight months of ongoing war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ player in the g@@ ild@@ ed Hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace in reception , I can not des@@ ing the expression that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the rash , yes . &quot;
&quot; but putting Putin in the smile , and he found barely warmth , even for his with@@ standing conditions . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan repeatedly spoke about his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level in front of the crisis , but even better . &quot;
the next day she described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard so would never happen to be anything worse .
I seemed to interpret his enthusiasm rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable radi@@ ant showed that the State of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory report : the down@@ shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was gone .
&quot; Putin made up and accused Ankara , Russia in the back . &quot;
the failure was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed friend .
Vet@@ r@@ ust is going to rebuild it becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; months the state @-@ controlled media led a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at once it seemed to be the Turks for everything to blame .
&quot; on the serious alleg@@ ations , the alleg@@ ations of leading officials were that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family profit from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria should have been controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has disp@@ uted this veh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was , that it was time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting was only taking place because Putin received the ap@@ gan as president of Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a cease @-@ fire is clear on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends who can get after spending last month at a failed state of almost his ministers .
repeti@@ tive terror attack on Turkey also have sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey harsh - especially ban charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number is gone by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel plans and charter companies will be reli@@ eved if the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
you are counting on a late storm at the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week projected the state of cheap cheap fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agri@@ business will be re @-@ imported . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti is form@@ ul@@ ating : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West as it is a reaction to the attempted power supply as weak response .
&quot; to this end , the continued Gro@@ ll about the sn@@ ail emp@@ i@@ ou@@ o in the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the er@@ pi@@ cht rises , out of cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian Heads of State won a bonus that he tried after the tried coup d &quot; é@@ tat support for the selected state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is a self @-@ comprehen@@ sible for Moscow , which itself has a profound fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ av@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , a matter of how it was a analy@@ st once described , &quot; &quot; alliance of aliens &quot; , &quot; two countries that are killed by the West and feel poorly treated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still great differences . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference in Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey are contradic@@ tory . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of initial discussions , both Presidents were told at the press conference , that they had not even saved the issue . &quot;
&quot; the president of Turkey committed it to answer any question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disp@@ aster , when NATO member states like the Russian fighter jet , it is certainly better that the two heads of State had at least once again talk . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland &apos;s no longer available
the brand R@@ BS aims to nur@@ ture the Bank nur@@ ture a bit more to a Back@@ office .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS were connected with the global ambitions of the Bank .
the Bank has since then dist@@ anced itself almost ten years ago and had to be saved .
&quot; in this period we have brand &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; to protect other end @-@ consumers . &quot;
they supported the international sport with millions of Po@@ und of Sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ bl@@ edon winner Andy Murray . &quot;
but now she decided to put more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock not@@ ing to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for private customer business , which will be more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes one of our Invest@@ ors &apos; brand and the brand , where our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS was used to become a global brand . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say that we are not pursuing a global goals , but local objectives . &quot;
&quot; each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities , and our employees will work among these brands . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer carry out his six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sport sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because we are asking ourselves inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very Cypri@@ ot three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these marks . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these marks again , therefore I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieved on pre @-@ dil@@ ection profit at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spray champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ ten profit &quot;
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori attended Friday his 3.@@ 000@@ ten British profit at New@@ market .
&quot; he sat on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year Itali@@ ans is the sixth Jo@@ ckey that reached the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the thir@@ tieth winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; I am very happy about it at New@@ market , because I am here for 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is an ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he gets the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a recru@@ iting career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had to 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career . &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and there is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that he has reached a few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma fans for many years already for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago in Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 profits , if he had not only been a weekend and Groß@@ tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has suffered nearly 30 years of winners in the UK which is great .
&quot; he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an unbelievable jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from flying finishes to Flying Dis@@ mo@@ unts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British flat network for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including its famous &quot; gl@@ or@@ rich Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had difficulty difficulty when he returned from his six@@ teen lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y its branches and to the bri@@ ghter form . &quot;
and he is not in the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori formerly said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia Putin feu@@ dal Stab@@ ur@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismis@@ sed its Stab@@ ur@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the closest confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has arranged without giving reasons &quot; the dismis@@ sal Ivan@@ ov@@ s organized by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidency . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has joined Ivan@@ ov since 2012 , was appointed to its successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his conclusion at the prestigious President of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) , and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin website , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was involved in the manager and the manager of the government . &quot;
he said about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think that it is the main task of the government to support your activity as a stat@@ ute on the law of law , and control for the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin distributed the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has taken Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest intimate Vladimir Putin and works as he works for Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
it was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men said that the rod became one &apos;s own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the paraly@@ sis for the cameras , are convinced here only a few of them - especially before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
&quot; so , here is the result of some sort of power change ? &quot;
this is not at present no one .
&quot; but the official statement that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential President , once the Russian environmental policy would like to lead to large skep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov &quot; &quot; is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ ained post four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov participated the post in December 2011 .
he previously was Deputy Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Safety service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin appointed chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , who appointed the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty . &quot;
&quot; Putin he called his power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of the five people who trusted the most familiar . &quot;
&quot; once was believed that Ivan@@ ov would become a second term president of Russia , as a third term Putin could encounter Putin &apos;s opposition to the Constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , closest ally Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 € expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the North deck of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four verses of the &quot; &quot; mercy @-@ blo@@ wer &quot; &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the brood @-@ section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ti@@ lt @-@ rope . &quot;
the £ 1,35 € expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; Keit@@ h Brown , hosted by the construction site , was one of the first who went from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineers in a truly ep@@ ic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which alone were used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the cover between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the br@@ ück@@ ende@@ ck is a delicate occupation , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , nearly 79 % of the total sto@@ ols down in their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets a Bet@@ ong@@ uss for the Deck , which means that the entire Deck is ready to put on the bridge to its place . &quot;
Michael Martin , Project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first cl@@ asp is a significant milestone in each Br@@ ing project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the deadline for future @-@ oriented high @-@ quality and low @-@ construction .
&quot; after installing the last street covers and its connection with the northern deck , we had to then close the still existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by drag@@ ging the northern fe@@ eder bridge of 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , since the vi@@ adu@@ ct 222 meters long is , about 6,000 tons and had to be drag@@ ged in a slope of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; secre@@ tly , since the toler@@ ances , on which the team has been working , tiny - on each side they ret@@ ains only a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off from their fishing boat from angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at took place on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had trouble swimming in safety while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat moved around , and set us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the lif@@ ebo@@ arding station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds is blo@@ wing the boat apart from their range until we left the water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved from a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on one bu@@ oy without life@@ jack@@ et . &quot;
they all came aboard the coast of the coast and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station .
&quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water , have luck in@@ ju@@ red and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot engine had an emergency , but these holes are off at the ken@@ tern of the Bo@@ ots from the person who controls the boat . &quot;
someone has awak@@ ened over these men today .
hard hurt - man sti@@ ched on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old has got the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the cut of non @-@ alcohol are the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when this came to the apartment , he came twice to them twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was wo@@ unded at hand and in the body .
the police could hold the perpetrators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ armed as a result of his sister .
&quot; together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted their brother to calm . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that was why she went out of the house with her life .
on the road they met the ex @-@ spirits of the man .
&quot; when the two women re@@ mar@@ ry the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister go to the side and took his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
who builds a cheap housing ?
the SPD and Green my : investors should be raised much more strongly in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; action concept &quot; to the next meeting .
but arguments is programmed .
first of all about the question : who is supposed to build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is lacking so far .
&quot; SPD Vice @-@ President Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in future , it must be 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
the favorable apartments can also be found in the inventory .
&quot; however , the big dispute point in the city hall is however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you want to build investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing program , which costs millions of cost and has to be financed . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as viol@@ as : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left is still looking for tough@@ er conditions for investors .
&quot; irrespective of what Brat@@ mann , v@@ ane is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; action concept is implemented , will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
&quot; yet , the program is not entirely destroyed : for the around 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; how do you compare the loss of other about 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose support will run over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments alone . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , so the plann@@ er spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought from the city now . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to get back home again . &quot;
this is possible in the western town .
one fell on one stroke will solve the problem .
&quot; for in the western town , the end of the dates are running out . &quot;
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price of cheap apartments . &quot;
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the number of social housing in the Western city is dramatically increased dramatically , away from the goal of the so @-@ called penetration . &quot;
there is no longer a concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few districts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be even movement in the discussion . &quot;
&quot; leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U have to start with the boat . &quot;
&quot; although , they have concentrated on more construction sites for detached houses . &quot;
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and happiness that is worthwhile
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; that teen@@ ager and child are no longer going to go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time to rigi@@ d , has been lam@@ ented in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Po@@ k@@ emon Go , it is about to take people from the sofa and become more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on screen was initially limited to the TV , then limited to video games and last to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters , first created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ s ( later it came into a drawing series , game cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture sank in the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
&quot; within a few days , Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users as Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players are going to go outside with their smartphone and look for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons who have been following with a GPS and once they have been found &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( over a screenshot on the cell phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was even younger , joined the W@@ ahn and sp@@ rang for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable rise of steps that will leave the &quot; average &quot; person each day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ og@@ ram , an app for Apple Watch , the 35.@@ 000 user re@@ trac@@ ed that Washington Post was recently re @-@ launch within two days of the launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people , which will exercise every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data about the performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring about to take a 30 minute time , &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; , &quot; to be active every day , because many public messages are boring and come from people who look like . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be assessed . &quot;
&quot; who drives out regularly sports , reduces its chances to di@@ re cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful thing to Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always there is m@@ apped game @-@ sp@@ oil , which always have to complain about something . &quot;
and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps such as Fit@@ Bit already could follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will release with the time .
&quot; due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will be able to combine apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in real world and many people on the hunt will help to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the ground .
on gan@@ zer line brilliant .
and now at last also the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ erin .
the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ champion title and enlarged the gap between yourself and the rest of the world from all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ er@@ kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze sculpture of Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es cont@@ ests on the sul@@ p@@ sich@@ ord of women in the art of art during the Olympic Summer in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , who wins a multi @-@ champion title , and overall the fifth , while being captiv@@ ated the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
it broke out when her final result was shown and her long journey found an end to that moment .
this success marks them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; it has been dominated the last three years of their sports , 15 World medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that heard a mixture of ambition and precision that she said &quot; The Best Tur@@ ner@@ in that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; they were expecting a final test in Brazil , a competition which did not feel so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of excessive expectations . &quot;
&quot; not back with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas will be considered as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans are Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace between gold and silver in the single multi @-@ contest in@@ ale of women at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ ly took the first medal on Tuesday , while she was reti@@ ring in the far@@ ewell party who was reti@@ ring in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as excer@@ pts . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , while its long run on the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of its ground exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , which was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ ing in the sports hall , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2013 she has been no longer lost for the summer of 2013 , a winning series that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two rot@@ ations , dec@@ ayed the picture . &quot;
sul@@ p@@ sich@@ ord and bow@@ ls - in which it holds the world title - lou@@ der .
she went back with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the float again - and sat on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
&quot; R@@ ais@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged them gently when they were anticipated - a mere form@@ ality - and tears in it , shining red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , when the vision they once was described in their collecting @-@ book , in reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of R@@ ais@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ r@@ ake went to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year team headed by the Americans &quot; &quot; gran@@ ny &quot; &quot; is called a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their ground exercise , she cast to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ ende , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for this , it is rapidly spreading the 19 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week , a whole new meaning : &quot;
police : 3 victims in series inf@@ ants in music scre@@ ened by car
&quot; according to the police report which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series of mass attacks by Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ er@@ ated eight shots from a handful of power , while he stood on the passenger &apos;s side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared with that the triple murder seems not to be the result of a smoking , as the att@@ acker had not participated the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who took possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting , the investig@@ ating the investig@@ ator to be a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , predominantly in h@@ is@@ pan@@ an dwell@@ ings were killed in nine months of seven ass@@ au@@ lts by seven persons and two others wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , divided Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects several vehicles used , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ ll@@ ac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators wei@@ gh@@ ed the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized because of their violations and died later . &quot;
&quot; Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness set the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and to listen to music .
&quot; the authorities published also a police report on the shooting , covering an empty p@@ impl@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it is assumed that it was the work of the series . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as pu@@ frag@@ ments from the engine room .
&quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of its aging has Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during her pregnancy did nothing . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought , I managed not . &quot;
I did not manage it .
I did not let myself be left .
&quot; what is wrong ? of course you have left it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize it , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ote him to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can work with the help of a hearing .
&quot; Ed@@ mund was not able to sit or sit down to his third year , and he can still not speak . &quot;
but he slowly makes progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he likes to play with his two brothers and sing .
&quot; Elizabeth reveals the character , which Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please consider me something ahead . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him character , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
&quot; micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses like mas@@ ons , or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it affects the life of the c@@ ann@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto remember the emotional price of a certain future .
&quot; I asked what will happen , &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t been asked for a long time for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to tell me someone really . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth damage caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it is better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

&quot; the other two victims were not found in the car and the police straight , whether in one of the last men of the offen@@ ders could be . &quot;
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a crus@@ hing between several guns .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for Stur@@ m@@ ehr@@ e that were res@@ tr@@ acked to various Stur@@ t@@ ins to be rus@@ hed to the Tat@@ ort .
it seems that this is clearly a continual struggle here .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the road , were h@@ ül@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; it seems to have given here several armed fighters , who were very active involved , distributed police skin @-@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles taken in the area .
&quot; there was no soli@@ dation , and the police currently reviews reports according to the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year girl met in my arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she recovered and the police are still looking for a suspic@@ ious .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine amongst the women &apos;s oly@@ mp@@ i@@ am@@ ship in the Tur@@ ns and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been at every summer oly@@ mp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly , this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , who inspir@@ es many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ oli@@ kin is round , makes every pride . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has consolidated the black and ugly female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number was one among the female Tur@@ ner@@ ers an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas had a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to be the witness of the incredible performance of the triple World in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ in@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone is the fourth , heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Americ@@ an@@ erin , which won an individual majority event for women gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won the silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but so you do not see sports classes all over the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the oly@@ mp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympics are only four tur@@ ers in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like exercising a more expensive sport is and Tur@@ ner can be maintained primarily in private sports , which will be maintained by parents , for the training , interior , travel , and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their turbines and their families ) . the list can be om@@ itted . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in af@@ flu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these verses , the Tur@@ ner received her whole training and that is a expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ er of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , both have trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired to the communities of au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , make a good and easy accessible exercise . &quot;
I was founded my turn@@ out of 20 years ago .
&quot; with my events we have offered free and affordable tur@@ mo@@ cks in Harlem for more than 15,000 m2 young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ an ) , and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality turbine , which make the opportunity to learn from this great oly@@ mp@@ ic sports type and benefit . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health as well as for the primary and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team to bring thousands of young girls to interest to the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this true representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic Games and thanks , F@@ ass you so many young girls with different background motiv@@ ates to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists would like to organize further strikes , after they refused Jerem@@ y H@@ unts proposal . &quot;
&quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes caused by adop@@ ting a reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37.@@ 000 Assi@@ stance , which voted upon him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt had been un@@ vei@@ led to introduce the contract , and said that N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and that any further delay for the employees and patients were harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first aid mat@@ ologists should receive a new contract , the changes to night @-@ night and weekend work , to improve the care of ung@@ ast@@ al movements . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee of Assi@@ stance the last night in a communication with : &quot; Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists have agreed to the proposed contract as before serious concerns , especially that it will treat the current availability crisis and it will be administ@@ ered to treat all doctors just . &quot;
&quot; at only eight weeks , which still fall , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , must be made progress and time is running out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to solve the disputes through talks in the government rel@@ uc@@ tance to participate and sometimes in de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened of an speaking , Jerem@@ y Hunt has only made the last month that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hunt has to act now to raise the penetration and concerns the worries of the Assi@@ stance .
&quot; if he should not do this , they have made it clear to assistance that they are ready to carry out further work amp@@ ut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw an up@@ surge of nearly 13.@@ 000 routine surgery and 100,000 appointments , as n@@ urses and specialists have been involved in order to give doctors on the strike . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes through an acceptance of the reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A would like to pay a better week@@ day compensation for the 54.@@ 000 Assi@@ stance , which will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Direc@@ torate @-@ General of the N@@ HS staff , called for the Assi@@ stance on to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working lights are not only little but over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families just worry , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we have spoken to the Committee of Assi@@ stance and the Ministry of Health , and other minist@@ ries in a positive way forward with regard to anticip@@ ation and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility during training , training courses and gender @-@ specific wage counter@@ feit in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day - drug to reduce the heart attack
thousands of galvan@@ izing plants will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day @-@ drug after having been recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time .
the framed medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart @-@ colour for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart of heart . &quot;
the regulatory body of the N@@ HS has recommended for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory body of the N@@ HS has recommended for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; some 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; galvan@@ ized and stroke are caused by means of fatty material in the arter@@ ies , the flo@@ ats are formed . &quot;
&quot; if the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ot that causes the blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood pressure is rede@@ emed , it can flow through the blood flow and causing the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to another . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and distributed under the chamber Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ auses un@@ prob@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the acquisition of nice , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the nice health @-@ based evaluation center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable adverse effects on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively , the reduction of other heart attack and stroke for people already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; by a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased to expand the treatment options for thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the lead @-@ design recommends no treatment which goes beyond this period of time .
culture of Political Cor@@ ectal cancer is set up in Muslim areas in Muslim areas
&quot; the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on dismis@@ sal of a government report for corruption from the office . &quot;
a culture of Political Cor@@ ruption has led that widespread elec@@ torate was kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored in Muslim communities as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , election , and Rath@@ aus@@ ages to have ignored evidence of &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ever and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , which is now a antagon@@ ism , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of constitu@@ ents from religious motives were so bad that the police should be permitted to protect deport@@ ees outside of elec@@ toral instruments , to protect shar@@ pen@@ ed voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a credit card to prove their identity by elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must only call its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not to carry out the finger on the finger of a person if they give up their vote to prevent anyone twice . &quot;
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it calls for the press to have more access to the community sub@@ sist@@ ence and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only for elec@@ toral election , but is also the communist government in front of the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that proceeds from it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Leg@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special optional case , that the acting Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was to be revealed after a L@@ itan@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim fel@@ lowship in z@@ yn@@ ic manner , and that he would have led his critics with r@@ attle and Islam@@ opho@@ bic alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man should &quot; &quot; have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dubi@@ ous or the result of a im@@ itation , where one person is chosen as anyone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud across the country .
&quot; in particular , he was particularly alar@@ ming of frau@@ dul@@ ent letters - in older members of the Muslim community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , de@@ formed , made several recommendations to s@@ acc@@ ents the elec@@ toral system , including the management of wise to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in its report it says : &quot; &quot; proof was attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , in particular women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the Elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ical or ban@@ qu@@ ed background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions have such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to the eth@@ ni@@ cs and religion kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to s@@ essed the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political activ@@ ist letters can edit , to stop &quot; election campaigns . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also calls for tough@@ er registration insp@@ ections to prevent that the elec@@ toral directory to immigration and social inter@@ acts is used . &quot;
consider options to consider voters before the election according to your ID .
&quot; not remot@@ ely inks on the finger of a person , once they gave her voice to prevent that anyone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic over@@ insp@@ ections on the nationality of a person carry out to ensure that they are un@@ law@@ ful .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic stamp .
ban on the fact that political activists will be able to process full @-@ elections and modification of letters .
the police give the authority to set up the bul@@ ations to the stations .
&quot; a legislative change , which facilit@@ ates an indic@@ t@@ ment because of inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the repression of the People Act 1983 ( census Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photographer in choice stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees rule out that voters are alone in the elec@@ toral campaign . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; astonishing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets fall no prison . &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ toral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for the s@@ itan@@ ei of corrupt and illegal practices as unt@@ ested , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , it was found guilty to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings - according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also cri@@ tici@@ zed the most effective &quot; dis@@ cour@@ ing control &quot; of the elec@@ toral divisions of the Rath@@ äuser .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country contributes to the mother of the parli@@ aments a proud legacy , but the worrying and covered spread of election was thre@@ aten and the denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger von Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ i in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are this week over the French cyclists Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot out of edge and band that proved to be an impressive dual @-@ predecessor in the Duke of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year of the Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one who fought gold , who has his own famous double @-@ lon@@ er - at least not , if one must give faith to the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which are at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL created a lists of Olympi@@ oni@@ ken , who have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holl@@ y@@ &apos;s famous . &quot;
&quot; the hunters and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates double @-@ predecessor on the Rad@@ r@@ enn@@ bahn , many people on the Internet are pointed out how to be a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison has created an ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter , after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ hei@@ ghted similar . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher was ins@@ ulated the ins@@ anity in the social media with and gave that he has already heard of his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , distributed Br@@ ady of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I remember the probably as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly look at the center : the all@@ u@@ ende simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ jum@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its great , expres@@ sive eyes is supposed to go through a double @-@ predecessor for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one step is higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver medals in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ shaped skin and bl@@ on@@ des hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while the American Nathan was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the in@@ doors : a Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory in the room : according to this user there is for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps a reason
&quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact the U.S. soccer star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which resem@@ bles almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ n Gab@@ by Douglas , which resem@@ bles its own beautiful , big smile that resem@@ bles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle union . &quot;

&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen statement , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times in the people who responded to the crew on Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ant colleague Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC cop@@ ated and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network ap@@ olog@@ ised quickly and gave a message .
&quot; we regret it sincerely , that these statements were made and that it was possible that they are broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot;
we have quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed yesterday with our spect@@ ators for broadcast and our tor@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in social media .
&quot; to clarify one , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments focused on the performance of the swimming @-@ in and not on it as a person . &quot;
nevertheless they were un@@ reasonable and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . Byr@@ on does what he said is very p@@ ity .
&quot; on Thursday morning , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his remark , he said that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment for me to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment , which I did for the W@@ BC Olymp@@ us , told , he said . &quot;
&quot; I looked at the performance of the daughters @-@ in , and not related to it as a person . &quot;

buyers in Pri@@ mark emp@@ ad over woman who tried in the midst of business under@@ wear under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to see them , as a woman pulled off their clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mark to try to taste under@@ p@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , they mu@@ st@@ ed her as she looked at it , she moved out and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she moved on and tried four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .

&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who had found himself at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she left again and leave the business without having anything to buy . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants out of the out@@ lay , moved their own ti@@ ghts and p@@ ants from and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a slightly discreet place to do it - it just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each rigi@@ d , when she moved the under@@ p@@ ants that you obviously did not like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three other under@@ p@@ ants before she decided that her nothing was liked to move again and r@@ ind .
&quot; it did not seem to disturbing that they had someone observed - or about the person to think , who would like to buy under@@ p@@ ants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who live in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how contradic@@ tory to think that someone would take him home , who had another person and were not washed away . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I got , the staff tried to pull the clothing items from selling after they went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate it , go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants to go home and find out that another woman she had and returned , and didn &apos;t have them washed away . &quot;
&quot; Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident in case that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were out of sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of weapons
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to get off with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how you can turn for your pre@@ dator . &quot;
&quot; if you are approaching from behind , then you should turn out to be the first so that you can see your att@@ acker and move out of the dirt line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with the knee into the gro@@ ste , and twi@@ sting you , while the att@@ acker attacks against pain , the weapon from his hands . strike it with the run into the face and move back@@ wards while she set the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the nut line , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate them , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time shift the weight of the gun and hit the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it &apos;s Miz@@ ra@@ chi pre @-@ making .
&quot; however , remember that it is the safest means to over@@ take your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;

&quot; the thought , to cover the dish@@ kno@@ b of a Zug@@ toil@@ ette that has been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually are in a kitchen sink more poor bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical specialists about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he hid , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was well known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of its intest@@ ine , travelling through the world and fun , as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public money to rail@@ ings up to sink of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely below a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told me : &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all kinds of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and h@@ amm@@ ers . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his call .
&quot; that which he ran , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
his pro@@ cal @-@ line showed a l@@ umin@@ ous number of over 4000 units .
in comparison to the l@@ umin@@ ous number of fresh hands amounts to less than 60 .
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused , after their l@@ umin@@ ous number over 4000 units were , while fresh@@ ly woven hands have less than 60 &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; this comes the worst thing I got into a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will do nothing here because it is in@@ doors here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equipment Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Avi@@ il@@ us , which contains both the lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D , to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ d Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explain the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , which made that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian call . &quot;
claiming that the interest in bo@@ wel health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
&quot; the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide more information on an interesting manner . &quot;
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the director of the film , added : &quot; let me be so saying - I would have lost my respect for Ian when he &apos;d suffered my respect for Ian , which I have reli@@ ed to him as the ek@@ el@@ ous Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things where it was easier to bring to Ian , she anz@@ lick and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we have added some of these dirty goodies to film .
&quot; in a valid survey conducted by 2015 in 2015 , 84 per cent of all respon@@ dents were lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent , that they have at least occasionally produce products , the attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;

&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were rolled rolled by her property , sho@@ cked the property of housing estates in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls presented holes on , wood@@ plate have been demol@@ ished , rub@@ b@@ ish was disp@@ ers@@ ed on the floor , and gr@@ aff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were ren@@ amed and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was for the people here an absolute night@@ mare and I believe people do not have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property will probably be considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ walls . &quot;
the family is mountainous and their reputation is also .
&quot; the pair had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had added the family , street struggles with Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ sle@@ epers , in@@ timi@@ d of inhabitants , drug abuse and excessive writing , streams and flu@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 whose name stood on the lease agreement , got in June an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found . &quot;
&quot; were tr@@ aded in the estate , in which in the past drugs were tr@@ aded , the wooden cas@@ ks . &quot;
neighbours said that they saw them on the streets and had to be called by the police regularly
&quot; Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ del@@ o@@ gi@@ ated her and her partner this week rolled by the property , after having received a prolonged period of 11 weeks to pick up voluntarily . &quot;
&quot; the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours , they said that their life was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one thing said , &quot; They were worried about anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood there because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it had administ@@ ered the family with the local authorities to cooperate . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the common house , the tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the r@@ enter should be able to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family since a delic@@ acy is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
it was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extremely and their actions had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community that have cour@@ ageous to us and have provided us the information we have done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will allow a number of neighbours and the message conv@@ eys that anti @-@ social behavior will not be toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; they claimed that money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don is , who was on a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after having been without Ob@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many rooms of the house were summ@@ ed with gr@@ aff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that they will be ten@@ ant to enter ten@@ ants , who do not keep themselves to the house . &quot;
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared that the dolph@@ in question had a clear warning to the other ten@@ ant who do not keep himself to the house .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can accept themselves without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who were s@@ worn by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate crimin@@ als and social behavior , which continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot;

Donald Tru@@ mp sp@@ ans ″ huge problems ″ in the elec@@ toral campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Republi@@ can is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns even in traditional conservative federal states .
the presidential did@@ at Donald Tru@@ mp now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ sp@@ elling and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ är has something like concerns vo@@ iced as correspon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp from the race , now the doubts about his success in the battle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp to evangel@@ ical Christians that he asked for assistance in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; to blame , false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , took him again his well known medi@@ ator . &quot;
Republi@@ can sky@@ bur@@ ns
Utah normally is a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
&quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June according to Tru@@ mp and its competitiveness by the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , &quot;
&quot; in front of this , the other Institute can see tru@@ mp in front , but not by far that are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
as endangered these are also Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC answered Tru@@ mp on the question , as he wants to stop repe@@ ating Clin@@ tons again : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether back , this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than to tell the truth .
&quot; if it does not fall for him at the end of the reasons for political correctness , be it in order , said tru@@ mp . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to Press@@ Control , the Party Tru@@ mp was supposed to have funds for the support of its elec@@ toral campaign , he should not present any better demand . &quot;
&quot; instead of it , one set up the candidates of Republi@@ cans for the Congress to get stronger among the arms . &quot;
Olympia : Triple sc@@ am of D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ ative commission in the case .
Kenya Li@@ ath@@ l@@ ete threatened by the second D@@ oping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach to home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee is to immediately set up a discipl@@ in@@ ative commission in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function had told that the former Spr@@ inter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , the Olympic village had a urine test , under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ äu@@ er F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team of Ken@@ y@@ as by the D@@ oping contro@@ l@@ le@@ uren .
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case , to str@@ ingent own investigations into a IA@@ AF spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken on the IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will make a review , it was called IA@@ AF explanation . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and took himself as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chef de Mission Stephan A@@ rap So@@ i . &quot;
&quot; he was in the possession of the ac@@ credit@@ ation of the ath@@ l@@ ete , who stood on the list for training controls in the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I was 2015 in Beijing WM @-@ Fourth over 800 meters .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Li@@ tic@@ ular Deleg@@ ation@@ sch@@ ef Michael Rot@@ ich had been de@@ duc@@ ted by the Rio Olympics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should have informed against cash payments of his country over the annual dop@@ ing tests . &quot;
media report said he was arrested in his return at the Nairobi airport at his return .
Kenya is at the IO@@ C for several dop@@ ing insur@@ ers for a long time under special observation .
&quot; at the announcement of the IO@@ C submitted more than 2000 dop@@ ing @-@ control controls before the Rio @-@ games , it was previously mentioned that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are addressed . &quot;
&quot; the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country before the summer , an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; as a consequence , the W@@ ada Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight con@@ form with the rules of W@@ ada . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athle@@ tics of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reporting the ARD reports were raised again and again , that in Kenya D@@ oping means are easily accessible and there will be a considerable ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C @-@ member Richard Po@@ and called for a similar study in Kenya , how he placed them in the Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;

Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival present the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this there is a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled themselves with the role of Mary a youth mare .
&quot; in orchestr@@ al dig the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ ian Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ten Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med . &quot;
we always say that they are characterised very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in her pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix that is perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have am@@ ber music really in our blood !
in this stage of st@@ aging plays Bart@@ oli a older Maria .
she is reminded of melanchol@@ y on her kindness with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first of all they are musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mari@@ as personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is clever , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character I called the Roman times , &quot; lau@@ ghing Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist .
it is so an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous generous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compliments back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
&quot; for him , he is a necessity for him . &quot;
&quot; one sees it in any of his movements , in his bli@@ sters , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip WM . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; in this piece it is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have gone the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ank went to New York and that New York &apos;s inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same issues , and they are just as meaningful as it was at that time . &quot;
59 years later this piece is still relevant .

Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died shortly after they had to leave the war @-@ exploited country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good in it is - as a warning and warning to others that are the risks associated with it , to go into a war region - people to prevent this decision to ever meet this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school@@ ma@@ ids from the east of London entered a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;

Turkey : Kur@@ dish community counts with mass evasion
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed bags , &quot; says the pl@@ edge of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany will be calculated with ten thousand deaths that escape from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the middle term it could even be &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard approach of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt the Kur@@ dish community of Germany is expecting mass refuge to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice , I researched with ten thousand deaths , medium @-@ term , with some hundreds of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , if Erdo@@ gan &apos;s regime fought the minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k the &quot; world &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government over@@ came across few years ago Kur@@ dish lo@@ ops with criminal actions , be 500,000 Kurds within Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the put@@ ted Putin &apos;s con@@ sec@@ ular@@ ity and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
many will begin to start in Europe if they continue to be suppres@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state , which himself took refugees , produced in their own country of refugees , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the pl@@ edges made the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tical cities . &quot;
so that Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the entry to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated in the past hundred years , said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U @-@ member . &quot;
&quot; the association demanded that the federal government positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan , and its supporters . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , a &quot; &quot; wit@@ ches @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; is held in Germany against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I have no more confident in recent months for the first time in Germany .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len who feared also the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the brand@@ y as man@@ ders were destroyed by teachers and other academ@@ ics .
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed bags , by the way the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ ar , said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the paper reported on appeal to the figures of the Federal Ministry , the Turks adopted already before the coup , the largest group of advoc@@ ating political persecution recognized in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on June 30th , this 11.@@ 386 people have been eligible for almost 29 per cent of all as the asylum ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , we do not find itself before war , poverty or an less@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , therefore from state @-@ side , individually followed . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; to go there , where it is w@@ eh@@ ni@@ fied &quot;
&quot; strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign , with and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia are not allowed to choose the country tag . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the rural elections will not resume directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for bl@@ ud@@ der as far as so far , it is not : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ sw@@ aying . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the elec@@ toral fighters are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country tag . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters im@@ prints , ballo@@ ons , flyer and at the end of votes not count , only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the elec@@ toral and last F@@ eri@@ day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again have to make a vote for the people of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be dre@@ aming of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD since 1998 strongest party , now lies in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; exciting , how strong new@@ com@@ er Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of Ko@@ ali@@ ous dust . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous elec@@ toral campaign , one sees it from its large pl@@ ak@@ y . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , spread ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , just as it already did its legendary driver Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering can get k@@ old feet and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel to blame for the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; have accelerated the rise of justice , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ U with its peak @-@ profile , the Interior of Lor@@ enz Caf@@ fier , has already experienced how it is , when you make the wrong time at the right place of election . &quot;
she has been invited two ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel at great customer ; Merkel Par@@ ag@@ oni@@ que is located in the Nor@@ the@@ ast .
&quot; but the target group failed , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Meckl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other Länder , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but there is a shame to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel to listen . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the North East @-@ CD@@ U is largely disp@@ ens@@ ed to the usual election conditions on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; so , Kok@@ ert , playing only a &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also has noticed that you lo@@ wed down on the land , that it has to be very strict , to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are on the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , the Gre@@ ens : in the miracles of the country hardly any . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U campaign , Kok@@ ert on his co @-@ fighters is also self @-@ suff@@ iciency : &quot; &quot; you have to go there , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats set last with 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
at the election of 2011 the SPD was still clear with 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small parties with seven percent in the surveys , should be able to establish the jump into the country tag . &quot;
they make a modern virtue of the holiday @-@ need for a modern virtue and place their elec@@ toral campaign as a large part in the internet .
&quot; online elec@@ toral campaign , &quot; calls it the provincial President Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the green elec@@ toral campaigns set out for local stimul@@ ants among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top @-@ class did@@ atin , cur@@ ves straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ ische lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; ballo@@ ons in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Restau@@ ration : musicians suffer from blocking
&quot; on the speed , with which the B 27 is refurbished , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the building work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and only at least 20 o &apos;clock , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; all these have done everything pretty z@@ ag , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff by the jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no hiding place .
&quot; the construction site could be scheduled at the Week@@ end of the half day before the end of October , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; pl@@ edged also will also be mis@@ guided , which is responsible for construction work , e.g. when it comes to setting up containers . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site took place on Monday to the south , and also the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been eliminated and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again relaxed , the traffic situation within the place relax@@ es . &quot;
the citizens can now connect from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 back to one side .
the so@@ fter traffic by the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some partial complaints , &quot; he says for the per@@ tin@@ ent management of the refurb@@ ishment director Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach @-@ Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner Street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many shr@@ ubs sought and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to some trucks in living areas are fran@@ k .
&quot; in addition , the speed b@@ umps are not observed , the community called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable crossing , &quot; &quot; says King , who himself made themselves on site about the situation . &quot;
there are two to three per minute to be scored .
the fastest was travelling with 77 km kilometers in the speed @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved , it has become more quiet . &quot;
for the busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg now the street is open again .
they don &apos;t like to look into the cards themselves .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to wag@@ ering in them , each one lets you see . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , the renov@@ ations has hardly been consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most easy decline , &quot; but also a fact that of course &quot; the tre@@ adm@@ its is missing . &quot;
the towns along the road are the most popul@@ ous along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already existence .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have made it hard . &quot;
&quot; we l@@ acked the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ ope . &quot;
we must be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; the sales division he rose to &quot; &quot; far more than 50 per cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tr@@ en@@ ation have thrown back to its operation &quot; two years . &quot;
half of his associates have to be released .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half of them would have been dismis@@ sed , the politics would have been different . &quot;
&quot; instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt on a request of G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial balance with the reference , the Gast@@ stätte am benef@@ ited from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it is also the dis@@ advantages that sur@@ pass through the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where such a kind of funding has been dealt with . &quot;
&quot; with all pl@@ agues , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will pers@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular passengers now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic management less frequently , he can understand . &quot;
if you cannot drive it is also very different .
&quot; that his stem cli@@ ent@@ el returns after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , there is no doubt that G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner maintains the impact of the B 27 @-@ construction work on its customers for the greatest crisis which has experienced its hospitality in their long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; constantly , in the name of the terrorist fight against laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior de Ma@@ iz@@ ère will now be a tome about safety package . &quot;
but what has a d@@ ul@@ ating status deal with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ iz@@ ère gives the ens@@ er .
&quot; all his proposals are politically acceptable , &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the presentation of his new security pact . &quot;
they over@@ claim anyone .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
even if I am looking forward .
&quot; but as an inner minister , he was situated on the results of the outcome , and in a &quot; &quot; he@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg , Ans@@ bach , has hidden a little time after the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , before he presents its conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but the fall for this are all the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known , announced that a new security agency should take care of the b@@ aking encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications on air passengers and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not yet surprising .
&quot; partly , the Ma@@ iz@@ ère starts a second session for proposals which has so far failed to do with the SPD : he wants to put sympath@@ etic for terrorist groups under punishment and jiha@@ dists with double citizenship . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; spati@@ ally the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; however , he still consider this for reasonable and challenging even nothing , which at the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner will not have any chances . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ iz@@ ère also .
they have partly in themselves : he plans for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people from deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees that are targeted into the country , before they leave their smartphones and open social media accounts for a safety over@@ check . &quot;
&quot; in case of sor@@ ties for ex@@ pi@@ ted asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than until now - about such , the off@@ ences or throwing their papers to wear their identity . &quot;
some of them is political and legal .
some also acts un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
&quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of ge@@ ological , for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ iz@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; but it cannot be in speech , that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg refugees were displ@@ aced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many people faced with the high refugee concerns about safety . &quot;
&quot; and things that are deeply engaged in the people , they left no cl@@ ing up in elec@@ toral times . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the insurance is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elec@@ toral struggles . &quot;
Union and SPD is therefore increasing their position in the issue of inner security .
in the past few days there was a high level between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ ger dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ als also call a bur@@ ka ban and a return of the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ iz@@ ère Mills also comes here to conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
from a return from the double pass he is nothing .
we have seen the discussion in Germany .
&quot; to be new , be not useful . &quot;
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is constitutional , and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner , it must only be revealed . &quot;
there is a lot of things which could care for dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is still trying to pro@@ claim the issue of inner security . &quot;
&quot; Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled first to be careful call and said , &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;
even more Volkswagen is yet to be seen .
&quot; despite diesel @-@ sk@@ and@@ als , the shipping costs are rising worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs round .
&quot; on the recall , there is a ver@@ tex for a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts in the disp@@ atch in the second half @-@ year .
&quot; Europe &apos;s biggest high@@ lighting can continue in the past year despite the diesel @-@ aff@@ aires , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets further a plus . &quot;
&quot; but in July the core brand VW above all turned into Western Europe , and res@@ ett@@ led the sale , as in the D@@ ax not@@ ated companies . &quot;
sold around the world in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ten the ex@@ ship@@ ments around almost a six .
brand@@ tri@@ eb@@ sch@@ ef Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann the weak@@ ened numbers from July above all back on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , it has given a purchase to several core markets due to the changing economic conditions . &quot;
&quot; apart from the situation around the coup in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um was deb@@ ited from the EU to resign@@ ed a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the gas ar@@ ming first ES@@ CAL@@ AT@@ ED , is also further escal@@ ating a minus . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected Hau@@ smar@@ ke of the Lower Saxony is still continuing to be able to un@@ wind through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months is only a supplier of 0.@@ 9 per cent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
consolidated @-@ tri@@ eb@@ sch@@ ef Fred Kap@@ pler was continued from January to July further on the sales spl@@ itting from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , around the world , 5.@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software subscription tests .
&quot; alone in Germany , VW about 2.5 million cars are calling for repair . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW , that the renovation of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion of vehicles , there are no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor service . &quot;
&quot; the client set up the customer after the retro@@ fit a &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
reason is legal enemies .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; reports , Volkswagen p@@ onder@@ ing its German customers to now have a guarantee for pun@@ ching diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW representatives in the Department of Commerce .
&quot; from the Department of Commerce was confirmed , that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has been able to fulfil the requirements of my investig@@ ator , and the KBA in full . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after the change@@ over no deterior@@ ations can take place and all type @-@ approved vehicle values are unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen even uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not , as it was in corporate business . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen the possibility that customers come for example a half year after conversion to a workshop - and to bring this to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is any other damage to any other damage that does not happen to any guarantee regarding possible warranty conditions , as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; not . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich austerity future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers , the 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day cas@@ h@@ less accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German Association of German banks speaks of an individual case , and does not see a signal : normal austerity must not fear , for their austerity pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; bearing banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay off their 0,@@ 4 per cent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this fee calls for the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on tox@@ ins or day @-@ cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; it has been around 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to another , and which he could not evaluate . &quot;
&quot; that lie in me on the bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 per cent costs , &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I cannot put up for every million 4,000 Euro . &quot;
he will now give the cost to the contrac@@ tion principle .
&quot; the cash simply lie in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four survi@@ vor@@ es , I don &apos;t care about the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker stand . &quot;
most customers would have an understanding and sel@@ f@@ tly to other assets .
only a few went to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative venture of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is caused significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to wear alone , be &quot; &quot; the economic recovery is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for accounts , credit cards or credit transfers . &quot;
with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros had taken the Thur@@ in@@ gia Volks@@ - and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger land with their Skat@@ bank @-@ Fili@@ ale 2014 head@@ lines .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive leader of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and austerity is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cliff which is equipped with a little abundant . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if they are free money . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 @-@ founded G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; at present , Bavaria , no further banks are currently known to charge a out@@ let set for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the German Con@@ feder@@ ate and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ b@@ anken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold , into neg@@ atives towards the private clients , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it dro@@ be the immigration from investors to competition . &quot;
customers in Germany will not be fallen in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who does not buy sound plates ?
lonely men aged aged sheets .
&quot; before you divide the comm@@ ent@@ eil to so@@ w him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ leather cases involving rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the sophisticated re@@ cl@@ ing of hol@@ dings is not attri@@ but@@ able to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are all predic@@ tive at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely trial group .
there is also no hormone by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while I am in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a hum@@ ble stop , and wild@@ ly sc@@ ant before I stand and something determin@@ ating like : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ hos is slowly introduced to his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate @-@ specific stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops , and try to estimate their age and mind through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I by S@@ ister Ray ( Data Number : two young women , three men middle age ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Data Number : eight men middle age , a woman , presum@@ ably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I wonder ? &quot;
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets . &quot;
&quot; this sound@@ plates , shown at the top ( he sent me the snap@@ shot via e @-@ mail , I am not followed at home ) , dress up the walls of his room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of its available income : it is now able to buy plates that he was not able to afford , when they had appeared , and again to purchase items that he sold as he was young and bank@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70@@ s which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things that I was probably something to young in order to buy it , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy records , more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t smoke very much . &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people that will be influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and let themselves be able to purchase their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually have de@@ ed themselves to 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
that would declare the boom of trail@@ ers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to recognize that record @-@ shop provides a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record @-@ fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to retreat to the stability of familiar sound@@ proo@@ fs , of objects , the happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a emp@@ tin@@ ess or pos@@ sessions of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; says W@@ Z . &quot;
this is as a collector in me and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ our &quot; team of a turn@@ table stack .
&quot; a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people bought a record the last month , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % poss@@ essing a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who own a record , no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the report , I would probably look very concerned while I have le@@ aved through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle aged ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more produced , less musi@@ kl@@ as@@ per . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , which only slowly come . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p which has dedicated the sound panels to almost one single floor , has a b@@ ted audience than I was going . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women aged aged . &quot;
&quot; even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ester syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ tu@@ pack@@ er pop instead of experimental jazz were reconc@@ iled from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;

&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs in the store for a few minutes and regards the variation of the plates available for sale . &quot;
it is more of a showcase of mor@@ tal and a big one .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so the collecting of plates is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from one computer or in other way but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a loved si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , by which is said that a new generation of record @-@ lovers is to have inspired : urban out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the sem@@ bl@@ ance that Je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants , I watch a group of young teenagers that group for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before buying a father and his daughter to buy a cro@@ sl@@ ey turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Bu@@ ckl@@ ey , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees it - perhaps because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate @-@ art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most for luxury items like plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my post@@ for@@ appointments take up that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave at least into turn@@ tables in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and records , which exist in reality , turn@@ tables and online @-@ for@@ e@@ for@@ s . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday tomorrow with certainty not by plate through records of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while taking the rigi@@ d look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year wrong moder@@ ator , who rag@@ ed over the shoulders of the middle age . &quot;

French Court based on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ zens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live , down @-@ down . &quot;
&quot; in a court proceedings , this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorized to sell 72 pro@@ visional businesses in which individuals within the camp goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ beverages , sell hair@@ dressing services , or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be crus@@ hed , because they would represent a parallel economy , which would not be paid any taxes , and which are a fire@@ - and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals are offered by the state @-@ supported unification and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also resulted in that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate 72 pro@@ visional businesses , but spatial ideas that concerns the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people to feed &apos; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of calm meeting between refugees and volunteers offer .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the precip@@ itation , the Jung@@ le Book kids &apos; Café des camp , the community @-@ fish is operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on Asyl@@ um for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &quot; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure for this children would be a catastrophe , of which the most recent eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants dro@@ wned on Friday , that the number of people in the jungle have increased to over 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number till now - after a steep rise from Neu@@ ank@@ ö@@ lingen in the course of summer . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ he must set itself on the next generation of speed kni@@ fes : in various Länder , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices tested , the temples are to be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic effective En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used at random points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , at motorway construction sites or to se@@ perate bridges with temporary Tem@@ pin , there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary p@@ itzer for compliance with speed b@@ umps . &quot;
but a lasting mobile building can be too dangerous or consuming .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery keeps in un@@ interrupted measuring set five days , the case data is encrypted via a mo@@ dem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be collected across multiple tracks across the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed b@@ umps , as well as access to time , driving and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly recommended state , one can move the pend@@ ant to the manufacturer with each car with a b@@ coupl@@ ing cl@@ ut@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that he is not simply cl@@ oned , he is filled out in the measuring system , so that the wheels will disappear in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the inci@@ dentally also sh@@ aded aliens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is to protect v@@ itzer against Vand@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer are tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities will also fl@@ ashes with the new technique : recently , France has earned 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain receives silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gold cat@@ ching gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ he Ru@@ g@@ by came in the final hur@@ dle at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji created a master class in handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , rep@@ ay , line @-@ up , and ro@@ her power to win gold - their first Olympic Games of every colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was shot by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they sw@@ allow New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could be returned to them in the final . &quot;
but independent of it would have done Fi@@ ji in this form a 15 @-@ man team in order .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ace for GB - but it is likely not - that at least a Br@@ ite morning have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben Ryan . the former manager for England from Wim@@ bl@@ edon .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost amongst Ryan each game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap will do , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began mar@@ vel@@ ous and let the attacks GB@@ s made from fun intervals .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . on , as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners were 5 @-@ 0 to the top , than O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai still added another attack from the right corner of which he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely left the ball .
&quot; a hec@@ tic T@@ ackle of Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa , a third goal , but it has Fi@@ ji only stopped . &quot;
in the seventh minute l@@ ete J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch@@ down and there stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still over a minute of playing ... in the first half .
&quot; V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u com@@ pressed by further weak tactics of the GB teams , and rus@@ hed to line to make a gate . &quot;
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to pause .
&quot; it is like Fi@@ ji was born to play , the 7 to play , while GB still da@@ wned . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ yan gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half time , until Joshua went through a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was running for long in favor of the South @-@ consul@@ ans , whose fans sang fo@@ ams and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the i @-@ bag with another attempt in recent seconds .
&quot; the fi@@ ff pastry , the fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and GB k@@ ick@@ ed crus@@ hed in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; early in the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and great Britain in South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - British transformation of the difference . &quot;
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front but Dan Nor@@ ton crossed the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored an gate among the post in the second half .
&quot; a brilliant combination of tactics from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , safest the profit - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ ine gold than with these games and that wants what hot .
&quot; from the first rowing down to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in its golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only the examples that were at the ru@@ ding , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was it present when she had taken on the second Olympic Games in a row , the first women in the history of the British sport that had made such a benchmark . &quot;
&quot; your domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least you are using un@@ written use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ l@@ ements that reflect on the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges which is not reflected in the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es .
&quot; behind each gold in the herd , a batt@@ ali@@ on is willing to contribute to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and there was none of f@@ anci@@ ents than the coach who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he is risky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , the op@@ eri@@ or , and this did they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads throughout . &quot;
it would have been a pretty f@@ lim@@ b situation .
it changes a bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he was in the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , start out what the break was to a minimum , in case that under such circumstances the correct term is . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
so it begins .
the herd in itself is a challenge but that makes it an even bigger .
&quot; in the im@@ pregn@@ ation of the victory , their first thought of Williams went their first thoughts to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ off morning so I spent something more than anything else and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only repeated how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive Thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have a better person for train@@ in@@ ating or want a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning has no race lost over the past five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark completed , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
&quot; it is really important , not to leave . &quot;
&quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not working out to make some rab@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; we wanted no fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result and win the race as we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding with your own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now they just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London it took about six months to grasp , that I am an Olympic Games . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years of pre @-@ exempl@@ ary for clarity taken care of
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ group &quot; , &quot; R@@ aster Gö@@ ller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far pre@@ formed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
it was that some time ago in the origin@@ ating in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later the Wasser@@ forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken were dis@@ continued .
&quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all that stands Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , who was 31 years in the twelve @-@ association employee , of which 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
&quot; now , he was reti@@ ring in the age of 65 years . &quot;
&quot; drinking water @-@ purpose of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein group with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of broad@@ brunn , promotes an annual about 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the churches Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Baun@@ ach . &quot;
for further cities and communities there are water supply contracts .
&quot; the current chairman , broad@@ cast@@ ings in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller 1985 was set as water @-@ wart and appointed 1988 to the Managing Director of the Pur@@ pose . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very varied and they extended from water management and maintenance activities on offices and organising activity , the budget creation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency approaches at weekends , &quot; said the President . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events they called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property runs in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the renov@@ ations of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the divi@@ ders of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; I have no breast@@ feeding has been given , and I have always recorded new innovations because water beats and drinking water to be the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used himself with much passion for his water @-@ purpose association , and he has lived in the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own business . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he used as a real practitioner for the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing group to the nit@@ rates in front of the Wasser@@ forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; for this , he received a lot of recognition and praise . &quot;
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller in turn had lob@@ by@@ g@@ ons Alf@@ ons g@@ rie@@ bel the 28 years with him worked together .
he is the best water @-@ sk@@ e@@ eper and he was a faithful squ@@ ire .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he marked the fountain construction and the re @-@ structure of the compul@@ sion . &quot;
but the greatest challenge and the har@@ dest operation were however the tube @-@ breaking at Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on a 3rd January .
&quot; at minus 17 degrees , the whole night had to work round , so that the villages were supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; even the supply of Neu@@ brunn , one can only maintain once , because one filled the floo@@ ding of P@@ ett@@ stadt . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose has been handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .

a 35 @-@ year man took on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ eide ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and they wo@@ unded fatal .
&quot; the man has inv@@ oked himself with us and stated to have his mate , he said a police speech . &quot;
&quot; the offen@@ ders is on the run , after him will be publicly ground@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , as Sven S. could be travelling with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters large , mus@@ cular , t@@ anned , and has a glass . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police has published a photo of him . &quot;
it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man carries a Gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still bear the weapon with you , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who Sven S. sees , is supposed to call the 110 . &quot;
the police spoke of a &quot; relationship &quot; . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetrators of 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the competent police in Lübeck , first of all , did not want to make any information for the ather@@ ather@@ ings or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; but they confirmed that a human being killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a dish @-@ delicate . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - Impres@@ sions for Deutsche St@@ ah@@ lin@@ industries
the kr@@ isen@@ das exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains protected by additional costs in million @-@ height .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which were dro@@ wned by the industry from the fur@@ nace promotion , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it is the liberation from the Renewable Energy Agency in the series production to the so @-@ called power supply in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; West German General Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Fri@@ day@@ edition ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really happy that after two years of negotiations we could finally reach negotiations .
&quot; according to the European Commission , the European Commission had planned to use the steel producer , the gases out of the testi@@ cles to generate electricity for their own consumption , to go to the check@@ out . &quot;
the steel industry dro@@ wn additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a fundamental agreement with the EU Commission for talks with competition Com@@ miss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators in the steel works will be replaced , an E@@ EG @-@ lev@@ y from 20 percent . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on self @-@ electricity generation .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely determined . &quot;
the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions &quot; &quot; emissions &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are considering &quot; &quot; IG Metall @-@ Chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
&quot; last year , the situation further intensified than the world &apos;s largest producers in China , given to the weak@@ ening domestic demand of mass @-@ cutting steel to the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers raise Chinese steel non @-@ cutting price dump@@ ing .
in the course of the Spring@@ s the situation has a little relaxed .
&quot; on the one show barrier to im@@ port@@ ant effect , on the other hand the economic views of China have stopped . &quot;
unclear is how sustainable the discounts is up .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp stayed on Thursday carefully .
&quot; finally , the prices would have been more stag@@ nat@@ ured . &quot;
the industry re@@ acted to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp wanted the last but also closing arguments of individual works .
&quot; at the end of 2015 roughly 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel manufacturers remain in spite of rising prices and increased orders . &quot;
&quot; they produced more than 3.4 million tons of well six percent less botan@@ icals as in the pre @-@ year month , such as the economic unification of steel on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the set @-@ up amount now went back to the second month of a row .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is worth two percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved level of order within the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is senior &quot;
&quot; S@@ ingen has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as young girl she was in the school@@ boy , in the school@@ ing course , she defeated the f@@ ach music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , they feel balanced , cheerful and a total of living , says it . &quot;
&quot; quite next , she does good things with her health and mind . &quot;
&quot; for singing is the same from several perspectives , a great hobby for seniors , &quot; says Erhard Hac@@ kler by the German seniors . &quot;
&quot; most people sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded , the joy of the music , describes Hac@@ kler . &quot;
through regular interaction you can tie and maintain social contacts .
&quot; they often solve social and family structures at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves to others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; sing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
for they are practicing a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who calls on his lungs regularly , but also in everyday life not as fast as the pu@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; even though it is about obtaining the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; for older people S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Association of senior organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common S@@ ingen had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or hearing of songs w@@ akes with older people many memories , often linked with positive emotions of their youth . &quot;
through Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially melo@@ dies himself denied people suffering from long back events .
&quot; in addition , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
at the same time concentrate on your own voice and on a pre @-@ given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; just older people , who live alone , practice so , not only to concentrate on himself . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that you experiences through singing in the choir , suppose Hac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ esteem is also growing through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I am long for something , I become better and watch@@ ful about me - this experience rein@@ forces . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he writes , little talent to have , betra@@ y@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; it is not alone - at 50 sin@@ es people , who h@@ ears you , if a tone goes next to it ? &quot;
looking for the right offer is seniors different possibilities , &quot; Hac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sing someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , you can easily join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
who wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir can turn directly to the church or the church front .
a lot of seniors can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; who does not have access to the Internet , can ask your family , friends or neighbours around the Internet . &quot;
&quot; who likes to sing , should join to join a chor@@ us , betra@@ ying Hac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this is true for each age .
cats respond sensitive as a cat on scre@@ ams of the young animals
Bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover what effect the ru@@ ding of kitt@@ ens have grown to adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , the as@@ ew@@ ing also let the males not cold - however they stopped in the contrast to the females always equal . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arousal level of Katz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the r@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they are responding to ten percent faster to lu@@ te of kitt@@ ens that have found themselves in great distress , as scientists found from the veterinary college and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
K@@ ater also react to the har@@ p of kitt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently , the acoustic differences between the building of less and strongly ra@@ ined p@@ ups for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the Biolog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is the first author of the study , which was published on this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitt@@ ens had been distinguished with the ur@@ gency of their assistance . &quot;
&quot; a total of nine adult han@@ go@@ ers , and eight females from the Ti@@ tion of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; you were played for a rest of little ones , which were taken for three minutes from the litter box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more powerful kitt@@ ens who were additionally raised . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the low sampling for expres@@ si@@ zing .
&quot; all females , even those who had not had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scri@@ be , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the l@@ oud@@ speaker if this rep@@ ut@@ ations played the very profound kit@@ ties .
this ability may be in@@ duc@@ tors or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Biolog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men on baby mammals . &quot;
&quot; also , some studies show that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the Biolog@@ o reported in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski starts with &quot; g@@ ala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
in Turkey has been issued against the native football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ l .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup , there will be an important football match in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; in front of the du@@ el of the Arch@@ riv@@ alen between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ in Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line of &quot; &quot; Business as &quot; &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; already in the suspension of the exp@@ iry of the exp@@ iry of July , the government , the daily life of norm@@ ality would not be affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup . &quot;
this will not stop in front of the football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r presented the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office a warran@@ t .
&quot; according to this , he is now living in America in America , to be a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ kis@@ ses should be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who made the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , by the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the first for 90 days were cancelled due to October , in fact that in the life of most Turks , but as good as does not have any impact . &quot;
&quot; the next &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; on public places in the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - as the whole country - split in pend@@ ant and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of workers &quot; club Cer@@ esi@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not counted among the friends of the president .
&quot; but what the p@@ ans of the Turks , but given a dramatic experience in history , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties is . &quot;
even the fans do not agree - regardless of whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or b@@ esi@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; g@@ ala &quot; , &quot; it will be especially arriving on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; his sporting value presented the Cologne season in the past season : with 17 gates , and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first play as a top @-@ part of his charity . &quot;
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he obtained the 1 : 0 @-@ winner bu@@ ffer .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured the cup .
&quot; thanks &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; found the disappointing season to record a conc@@ il@@ ful conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; lion &quot; &quot; is distinguished also in the Europa League early . &quot;
in the south @-@ per Li@@ g there was only one rank six .
the season was not good .
the Po@@ kal was the only way to win something .
&quot; this we have managed and that is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as the game was better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 seasons , as an Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher was the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
that is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , the Gom@@ ez was created at the AC Florence treaty and not only borro@@ wed to the coup after the coup attempt to not return because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario want to come to us , he just have to say it , &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; Club@@ chef Fi@@ cre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the storms would have to be ready to rel@@ inqu@@ ish around one third of his at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot;
&quot; despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have still medals there , for Olympics in Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was closed twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia st@@ ano@@ wa may not start in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing determined still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had lam@@ ented after a dop@@ ing lock their starting right short before playing ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ c@@ ading and f@@ aded . &quot;
there was a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenery : with a sp@@ lic@@ ed smile she was still pro@@ voc@@ ed in the hall and prov@@ oked with her performance .
&quot; as a stand that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into an J@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more athletes , who were at the start of the Olympic Games in Rio at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial pieces in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 till 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the largest editor of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Games and seven @-@ fold World Cup had to be in 2010 after taking the pain using ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after a surgery you had a strong tooth pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended themselves . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 was the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ee of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster@@ in from 2010 to 2016 positively on the ban stimulation means meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ kovic took the wis@@ ely intake and has been closed six months .
the four most widespread lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ oured .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympi@@ asi@@ eger and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was successfully tested and 21 months were locked . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement had been responsible for bet@@ ray mer@@ gers .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has over 200 and 400 m of the so far @-@ fastest man in the world .
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ dies , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes have been detected as many medals . &quot;
&quot; in this way , T@@ ich@@ on lost its World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having found testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the meantime 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ di@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ titles 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also recognized Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the Olympic Games in 2008 was given back on account of a testimony of the International Spor@@ ts@@ court CAS CAS .
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is on rank two of the world list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world &apos;s ch@@ anc@@ ellor and gold fav@@ ori@@ ess was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year old World Championship , references to the intake of a ban supplement were found , the sper@@ mat@@ re of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency W@@ ada fell down and ran already on July 13 . &quot;
Bom@@ ben@@ terrorism in Thailand - Austri@@ ans in@@ ju@@ red - multi@@ tudes
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is standing in touch with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; they suffered snap@@ shot and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left again . &quot;
your home trip is scheduled for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the Ph@@ u@@ ket Island , Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on also are also Austrian citizens . &quot;
&quot; the State Department stand at this respect in constant contact with local authorities , so bar@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; at approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hua H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Ex@@ cur@@ quarter two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the police have been killed and been viol@@ ated for about 20 people , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in a Friday morning , two jumps went high , and he was killed another man according to the authorities . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bom@@ bing of bom@@ bs .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular famous Bad@@ estr@@ ands Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was in@@ ju@@ red according to police conditions . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bom@@ b , which has a city of the city . &quot;
the spr@@ int is according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et before the Re@@ four of the coastal police force in the air .
&quot; finally , more determin@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast , as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on , on the south @-@ east coast several wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; one go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ ent@@ ate carry the same manuscript , &quot; said armies Dan@@ ai crit@@ eri@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ early in front of journalists . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot;
&quot; it is too early to speak to possible motives - probably though it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ b @-@ produced separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared the attacks in relation to the Islam@@ ist rebellion , or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age which limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; instead , one go out of the fact that the bom@@ bs were laid by the enemies of the ruling military j@@ unt@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have been giving advice to im@@ min@@ ent references to the south of the country - however they don &apos;t have been informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
yet it is still unclear that group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police proved its officials in the whole country to increase security around important government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are still smaller bom@@ bing ra@@ inf@@ all , but they are usually not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hua H@@ in is a palace built above the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Adu@@ ly@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the reading bom@@ b attacks , the Austrian State Department recommends that the Austrian State Department recommends a result in its homepage , the instructions of the Thai security authorities necessarily . &quot;
&quot; high safety risk ( security level 3 ) used for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security and Muslim population , it will not take any necessary journeys to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the German military j@@ unt@@ a .
the military has a great influence in the military as well over the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bom@@ bs have been trying to sti@@ el chaos , while the country towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military unt@@ a , which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody crimes , considers himself good to have led the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the military for years in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok the attack had been killed in a popular Hin@@ du Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity &quot; movement is in the sight of the Federal Minister for Constitutional Protection .
&quot; according to several countries , the constitutional Prot@@ ective in the Bund also provided the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &apos; Identi@@ ty movement &apos; adequ@@ acy for aspirations against the freedom of the democratic basic order , &quot; said Constitutional Treaty Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the Deutsche Presse Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
thus adding other Islamic faith or the Middle East will diff@@ use in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are monitoring the movement well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns out against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity by estr@@ ang@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; Constitutional Court in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &apos; identity &apos; . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the state officials in the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Treaty . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking extre@@ mi@@ sts , they speak with y@@ outh@@ ful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the identi@@ ties of the Islam@@ ists as well as the right @-@ extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not concrete advertisement for the own cause .
the propaganda must speak the people emoti@@ onally .
young people are in a special way sus@@ cep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , from several Länder reports have been given reports of the &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have knowledge . &quot;
for the constitutional protection of this kind may only be relevant from a certain point .
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people , the extrem@@ ist are changing , their target area changes and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
so whether such people have controlled control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the marked increase of ri@@ ghted crimes and attacks upon asylum seek@@ ers and Refu@@ ge@@ es , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of renewed terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be sure @-@ defined structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
&quot; it may be quite true that further legitimate group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other extrem@@ ist moti@@ fs . &quot;
but a nation@@ wide or europ@@ aw@@ ful control of leg@@ o@@ ror@@ ism is not identifiable .
the former groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; in addition , Ma@@ ate were worried that many over@@ gri@@ ps went to the account of people who were not in appearance before in the right scene . &quot;
this is worrying .
&quot; many of the scene of attack on asylum seek@@ ers were not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated criminal prosec@@ ution or trail@@ ers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes committed previously with legal extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , who then have radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ oni@@ ken or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center schw@@ amm , the slightly excessive swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia is so slow that he did not see anymore in the TV @-@ pictures . &quot;
he disappeared - no matter how far the detail was selected .
in the social networks we went to viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old will end up with a return of 48 seconds and won the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather his not just spor@@ ty figure , which attracted the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start@@ up from the international swimming @-@ association .
this is distributed to make swimming in lower countries known .
&quot; as in orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c the most spor@@ tsmen run , just wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nickname began round .
some media signed him as &quot; RO@@ BEL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in inc@@ ess@@ ation to a &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ blatt &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; about him funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he proposed only at a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meter of freedom @-@ style , played there no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i has given attention to medi@@ al attention .
&quot; memorable was the appearance of the swimming pool from equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in one run over 100 metres of freedom @-@ style . &quot;
fr@@ ene@@ tic was moved to M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i back then .
the at that time 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before Olympia and had never been a long distance before the competition .

the Republi@@ can presidential guard Donald Tru@@ mp speaks at an elec@@ toral event in Florida .
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election to the U.S. President , Donald Tru@@ mp has already an alternative video . &quot;
he is just driving in the holiday .
&quot; lose Donald Tru@@ mp the US presidential elections in November , would give him the relatively no matter : &quot; &quot; ultimately , it will be a very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Candi@@ date of the Republi@@ can in a telephone interview with the US TV broad@@ ders CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it does not fall for him at the end of the reasons for political correctness , be it in order , said tru@@ mp . &quot;

&quot; fees per cu@@ bic meters ( from 1 October 2016 ) for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ al 3.@@ 44 , instead of being considered , for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( until now , 2 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf ( until now 2,@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf the se@@ wage fee will then increase once again , if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after an excessive calculation , the se@@ wage rate will be in Az@@ endorf then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found in the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rat@@ ory Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these wast@@ ew@@ ays under@@ lines . &quot;
the A@@ endorf market is committed to a legal foundation to run the systems cost @-@ effective .
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ al , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lin@@ den@@ berg , and Zul@@ tenberg have to take deeper into the money bag . &quot;
ag@@ it@@ ating increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed up the body , was a re@@ ap of charges for the wast@@ ew@@ aters of the market communities . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ covers from the preceding cal@@ ine period will be charged . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ vi@@ ing hu@@ stle generated , Schmidt laid it in all three se@@ wage systems for relatively small facilities with a very low wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment , that is located between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 Ku@@ bi@@ km@@ eter per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the low distribution basis , it would have a effect on the low basis for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the dra@@ inage of all three systems is slightly declined . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the backward calendar @-@ period , during all three systems not least due to their age of training and repair @-@ time expendit@@ ures in a significant extent occurred . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to a damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ es , which had to out@@ dated nearly 20 year old conveyor belts , and in the pond system Lop@@ p had to be installed after nearly 20 years of operation the first cl@@ am@@ ber has had to be installed , in order to keep the water @-@ legal requirements even in future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary applications came the advanced training and maintenance costs , which are considered to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which with the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 still significantly below the present level .
&quot; in the three lines , stone buildings made the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; additionally , Schmidt , the market communities of large entertainment costs have been spar@@ ed in the se@@ wage systems for the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious about the lines of stone buildings in the long run , especially since they can not extend the supply area of the se@@ wage @-@ purpose of the Fries@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal for these plants , because it is concerned to benefit patients . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % were on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.7 % . &quot;
&quot; the annual closure of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) , compared with the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % . &quot;
&quot; the price of consumer price in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amo@@ unted to € 0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 was compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.2 % .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect cri@@ tici@@ zed as asi@@ an caric@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired anim@@ e but some observers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel against breeds .
&quot; with its filter tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already adjacent to the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a character that could be from a Roy Lich@@ tenstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ flo@@ wered , sel@@ f@@ ted tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ ections per day . &quot;
all mis@@ ses get to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have moved in the past criticism in which they were accused of acting or acting white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week proposed a filter a filter , which gave them sl@@ ing , false teeth and cro@@ wned che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow @-@ face . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether these repeti@@ tive contro@@ versy en@@ acted on a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the rebellion were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it could have disabled . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was meant as hom@@ age to anim@@ e @-@ characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ standing , the r@@ ami@@ is@@ tism have experienced , rec@@ alled the filter of vulnerable stere@@ otypes . &quot;
others have chosen the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail he wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student , whose T@@ we@@ et has been widely used about the photos that the filter &quot; &quot; hur@@ rying and anger was not unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very contradic@@ tory Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not in @-@ secured , but that the money was pulled into the value of extremis@@ m . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural pride .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diet and integration , from meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
&quot; and Snap@@ chat large audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in matters as their older counter@@ players , they might want to assume sen@@ sibility . &quot;
&quot; if one of Snap@@ shot Fil@@ ters is an image created for a user en@@ viable , so it &apos;s much more difficult that such things were un@@ noticed when it was the case , the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday she decided Zh@@ u , who works as product management and engineer for medium to delete their Snap@@ chat account , and called others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that rac@@ ent control can reflect a lack of diversity among the settings in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u critic@@ ised the large part of white ; only male leaders and ended their attachment with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so that they can make such choices , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people working with other skin colours that are working there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable in order to say something against it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any numbers of diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday it was Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company has recently focused on a personnel responsible , focusing on non @-@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said that she will be closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask myself whether they need more users like us to say that this is not o.@@ k@@ . &quot;
&quot; military @-@ Military Cri@@ mes , Cri@@ me Information , represents a committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; members of the United States Central Command changed thou@@ ghtful information , to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it had allowed the actual conditions on site in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provisional report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Members of the dispute between Central Command Secret Services , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Services , reported by much dis@@ satisfaction among the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American anth@@ ems in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news services that were typ@@ ed by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ ders , recorded regularly a posi@@ tional picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it would have been allowed by the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened to Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can became a member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership error in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ round report presents detailed ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the education of the Iraqi army .
&quot; although there is no direct reference to that administration under Obama will have given instructions to change , it shows how an@@ al@@ ysts have exposed to the pressure of their laws , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of the year 2015 , many central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were significantly more positive than the facts presented . &quot;
&quot; for instance , a Cent@@ Com are publicly known that a military re@@ conquest Mos@@ sul@@ s can already start in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of parliament from K@@ ansas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 until the middle of the year 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command has changed the following reports to play the risk of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans ri@@ ef@@ en called Task Force to Life after they played an@@ al@@ ysts concerned with regard to mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic state .
the report published on Thursday will be completed in more detail and will be continued during investigations .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway through the Direc@@ torate @-@ Chief of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the News@@ itt@@ ees released their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com mo@@ an over@@ ly restricted process for the preparation of down@@ sides to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; gave the highest pri@@ st@@ al democr@@ at in the coma , member of the Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Ship , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , such as Mr. ship , &quot; ench@@ ant the release of un@@ question@@ able reports , &quot; s@@ worn the mor@@ als under an@@ al@@ ysts and &quot; gave excessive space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. ship and Democrats gave no evidence of an intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st regarding a &quot; specific political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
&quot; in the past of August , the New York Times reported by investig@@ ators from the Pentagon , which were recorded after complaints from Cent@@ Com analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Patrick Evans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not be discussed during the investigation of the general spec@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense will welcome a contro@@ versy discussion of these important issues of national defense . &quot;
the investig@@ ators have re@@ percus@@ sions on the question of a successful aviation campaign among American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question to what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ our@@ able ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic state remind of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the former government under George W. Bush faced with the recommendations of many an@@ al@@ ysts in Iraq a little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker has also played a key role in the u@@ prising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team won by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to indicate government proposals against the statements made by the Islamic State ( sur@@ rendered no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these pro@@ vis@@ ually refin@@ eries would have taken place , in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this realization was not published , however , the Times reported in September . &quot;
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commands , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Legisl@@ ative Council because of its excessive positive assessment of the war in a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command through Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two gates for the American field@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in an Match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they can not remember this ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot;
I do not belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; however , they know that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place that remain un@@ be@@ aten after its 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first lap .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two can gain first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first @-@ placed will take a little longer from the path that lead the other group .
&quot; whatever the game may start on Saturday , the Americans have triggered their success story through their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey collection in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years it became the national play@@ back of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 since they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an English , trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ ings in London that we now have .
we have left the ruin completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the tor@@ ches in the first half of the game with a rash from the Middle East .
&quot; India was gone to the game without victory in the game , but the team was surprising and lasted from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , which took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; it complet@@ es a spr@@ int with the flat ball through the left side , then moved to the middle and l@@ up@@ ted the ball into the gate around the Americans to get a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amongst the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and in@@ es@@ capable of , a rapid stag@@ gering to between competition and quest . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the oly@@ mp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning st@@ ab , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to turn to the Tur@@ ner to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you can not switch the TV to read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the qu@@ eu@@ es in the coff@@ es@@ hop , without having Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could have absolutely been sent among these well known names that would have been sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising if he would have a swi@@ mmer , Tur@@ ner or even F@@ real . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the oly@@ mp@@ ic tramp@@ oline for gold . &quot;
the oly@@ mp@@ ic flame does not light every event alike .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : air@@ brush shooting , arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ feeding and may have it for a long time .
&quot; but if I might make modest arguments for my particular lover , then let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ me of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline has already been an Olympic event , when it was in Sydney the last 16 years was so spar@@ se that many that I asked , didn &apos;t know that it is at all a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent Ath@@ l@@ ete to the competition , there has never had a medal in the tramp@@ oline and had managed to finish a athletes who made it up to the final . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline is jumping , partly because it sounds for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a cl@@ own@@ ing school as the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous tre@@ m@@ bling of his never to end , but also the Grazie of the gymn@@ ens and diving , the two sports that combines it in essence . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ ing winner jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shooting almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a range of falling movements ( rotating , h@@ ens and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are assessed according to official oly@@ mp@@ ram by execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ recur@@ ring athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women are competing in Rio against each other . &quot;
the common oly@@ mp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight .
&quot; medalli@@ sts must go on in their quest for gold , faster , up and over , sometimes until the finish , sometimes up and back , up and down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the cur@@ riculum , but also in the TV transmission , also another height of the world or the Olympi@@ as the Olympi@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the target @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bles , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir@@ ring a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it is also what I am looking at trying to look at these games as something like .
&quot; of this , the tramp@@ oline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a down@@ ward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t from , seemingly fu@@ el@@ os like an astr@@ on@@ aut , goes down , then go down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; here there is a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant abolition of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games only can be .
&quot; the qualification round and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in Stre@@ aming about 13.00 Eastern Time ; that the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of a afternoon blocks on both days from 2@@ pm .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympia man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tumor . &quot;
&quot; if the consciousness levels can only be reached by the att@@ aching , and the obj@@ ectivity of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal , then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his new fan base . &quot;

violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators are demanding political changes in Ethiopia if they were calling for violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ ested during the cl@@ ashes with the police were killed in sh@@ outing .
is Ethiopia just to break together ?
&quot; in the last ten years it was one of the most vulnerable countries in Africa , a solid ally of West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last few months , the protests against the government and widespread protests against the government , and more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people hit the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was not mer@@ ci@@ ful to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were on zig un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; in circulation , the videos on the protests supported by the last or early of this year , show how security people were to hit with blocks , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now calling for an in@@ coming investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to stop this land and in future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence agencies work closely with Ethiop@@ ians , to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy is expanding in a respectable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pitch in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet and safe and clean .
&quot; even though Ethiopia has been anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereby dis@@ si@@ dents were effective to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in central Ethiop@@ ia . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments that cover all from the ground @-@ use to the stran@@ gl@@ ehold with regards to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a far @-@ reaching critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea ; a struggle for this z@@ acked , controversial line called in June hundreds of lives . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts as the Oro@@ mo @-@ liberation Front , or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less en@@ forced in recent years , the turbul@@ ence and flows again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of having to explo@@ de under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media , because cheap smartphones are becoming more frequent and improved the Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government keeps access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate about internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies , which hide where they are going . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians have given that they gathered so among protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ es in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from equi@@ val@@ escence in the majority of Ethiopia , in politics and economy , while they have been the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in flat land areas . &quot;
but that is also changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Mi@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests found in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have felt that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which is dominated by approximately 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in military services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former vine leader , was until his death at a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as tac@@ tical genius , a man who was able to think about corners . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st say that he was particularly vers@@ ed to use early signs of dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ ment and special , to edit opponents and make them un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the present regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ians of new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively in@@ scr@@ utable reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; different from Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of Northern Africa , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say he did not enjoy the trust of the controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia was experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested by the an@@ al@@ ysts were seemingly fu@@ eled by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following raid , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ ality of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month of the prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ bi City , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hat@@ red towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more efficient in social media . &quot;
an@@ al@@ ysts say that the protests and other Western allies have a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though she recently investigated that she has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want to be together in a already vol@@ ati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains its claim Obama was founded ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m .
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp was trying to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy en@@ cl@@ ing his campaign by organising his several repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; this clar@@ inet conc@@ ise new questions on the communication skills of the presidential data of Republi@@ cans , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings its co@@ ach@@ ers , who try to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protecting , in the peculi@@ ar position , declar@@ ations that he could not have meant to be meant . &quot;
&quot; after spending the clear@@ ing event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp had done on Wednesday , Mr. Tru@@ mp in relation to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he was really not intended to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp , he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp was said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation is completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t , Mr. Tru@@ mp would help to weak@@ en the statement that Mr Obama wants to destroy him , the Republi@@ can presidential guard wanted nothing to know about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism pr@@ un@@ selt on Mr. Tru@@ mp while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of random or@@ atory values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speeches at the economic situation in Michigan during this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp was trying to return to this topic again .
he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes on higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought to his defence Sar@@ kas@@ m .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself , when he meant the Russians were Mrs. Clin@@ tons of emails , but he later explained &quot; &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the boundaries in politics and then move back on demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; , &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe it is clever enough to hold his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in a different way . &quot;
&quot; instead of keeping the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has taken an even estimate of their tone since its re@@ ques@@ tioning went further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who posted on Friday showed a lead with a big jump into the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ head @-@ head in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp in general is trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often accused his critics , nor understand his statements or to understand his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while being reinforced in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ tails into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant his statements may also be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements was asked whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is in this sense true that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ hoe , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstre@@ am Republi@@ can attempt to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as the Foreign Minister , it allowed to spread out to spread the situation in the Middle East as aggressive under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp put his attacks on the media and cast them down to him on every one of his words , and to be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he desp@@ ised the &quot; poor , j@@ äm@@ mer@@ al &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; You Can Not ! &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats watched over Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ology as only a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential system .
&quot; once about the price of the market , Café is returned to Green@@ point . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ worn cafe in Williamsburg , where you could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee ser@@ mon . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices made out of his Bedford Avenue of a front door . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which took place in summer 2014 , s@@ ells soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people entru@@ sted it as the last loss in one of gene@@ tically educated city .
&quot; the artist &apos;s Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ar wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b now is a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but when New York change is , then it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a rev@@ ital@@ ised Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ time employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer provided a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , fixes a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ summer model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment on .
he carried out new ingredients .
on the menu you are sand@@ wich@@ es with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ ers such as cap@@ es and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natural travel @-@ bow@@ ls .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a constant stream of old tri@@ bal customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed by prices from Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , dwelt in Williamsburg earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after they moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way up . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coff@@ ee@@ am , she said . &quot;
&quot; I realized that there was the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b that fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink it coffee again , even if they are on this day instead of their usual i@@ ced coff@@ ees a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ term and loyal customer since the beginning of the start in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inev@@ it@@ ably always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch , and they prepare my Every@@ thing bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ guez , he wanted to experiment with and pick new ingredients into the menu . &quot;
&quot; today , Ros@@ enthal still gets its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t have a gro@@ ove about that the soap has taken the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie reminds of a special soap for r@@ b with the cold @-@ coloured coffee of cafes as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the cafe . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he has pre @-@ managed them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local s@@ aft@@ ary wants to fill the cold @-@ burnt coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expan@@ se on a notified building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was Chief Apostle and said that he was destroyed in the ground than the café closed .
&quot; opened as the new café , Wh@@ itt said the prayer of the Lok@@ um and the bri@@ gh@@ ten a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to cre@@ ep , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; ample meal &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as gour@@ met President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for ingeni@@ ous Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen on Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ tur@@ tle soup .
&quot; his menu on this day was something modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , potato p@@ eg@@ ree and as dessert a p@@ eg@@ men@@ pu@@ d@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both the food histori@@ an .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was told by the Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while sitting in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about living in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; the newest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which is published on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American cooking during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ por@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in business since the stock crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cream cheese with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with mas@@ hed and vegetable soup . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ por@@ ter Hack@@ br@@ ats ordered , this found the pair of discussing the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ anu@@ t , Leb@@ ri@@ se and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
&quot; they were made out of an ingredient and a somewhat different , that the ingredient is stretched . &quot;
&quot; imagine so many Earth nuts must eat , that they serve them as dinner . &quot;
co@@ d sm@@ ir@@ ked .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach as a lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , a All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women co@@ conut for male cant@@ een workers and it was served fresh past@@ ed past@@ ures for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; A Square Apartments &quot; &quot; stands the way to which the country went in , no longer the sacrifice of the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food was a central theme for the Americans was a central , pointed theme , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense was the new Bud@@ get@@ ic : mysterious dishes like bread and cas@@ ser@@ ollen have been revi@@ ved to stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ ole as a wonderful way , the cas@@ ser@@ ole as a wonderful way , as chefs could hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dr@@ ags .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of the American cuisine for years , was a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculi@@ ar compounds were tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishment satisfaction has been priority against flavor or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , prepared bri@@ ck@@ man a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ anu@@ t butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man goes further out : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ t butter and baked oni@@ ons are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the farm recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , drove appliances - including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 , the eating habits of the country of such . &quot;
&quot; by doing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; household &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform them as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Apartments &quot; is a celebration of historic delicacies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa agrit@@ ourism in his kitchen , living in like the million@@ th man of the world , to which it has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine as fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost golden dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully realistic .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ ute him with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book the an@@ archy of a house@@ ke@@ eper had no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought the bor@@ ed food in Washington but also one of the gro@@ omed prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , with food to deal with , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science on foods was applied . &quot;
the pair gave us better understood when writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw food .
&quot; she had a real fear of waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded : &quot; &quot; she made people actually sick . &quot;
there was the wind @-@ exploitation .
&quot; after the plate were cleared from Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they pulled and past@@ es a dessert that they had cooked at home : the p@@ av@@ ens of Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt to mid@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , and added that it was an ordinary trick , modest recipes send a name to be missed . &quot;
&quot; there was no p@@ oured cream , only pl@@ ying , somewhat fl@@ our , sugar , water and c@@ inn@@ amon . &quot;
everyone de@@ af a spo@@ iling a spo@@ on in the pi@@ ds , brown limb@@ s . &quot;
surprisingly it was not bad .
co@@ e hol@@ te three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer , he said to his wife , &quot; A couple of ch@@ opped Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o
he sat down his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar dedicated his life to man in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a bom@@ b attack by Assad regime .
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil defence group , which had previously saved lives according to image @-@ newspapers previously nearly 6@@ 0,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 Volunte@@ ers put their own life at the game to pull people from bom@@ bed houses and to help in the war @-@ area first aid .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house dating back to the world . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans for the shining symbol in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; but as a hero he has never seen himself , said according to image : &quot; for me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I try to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar fell victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ opter turned out four bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as . &quot;
&quot; one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bom@@ b , so that not children play , &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b of Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest whi@@ tier is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come only in winter to finish surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the S@@ anna report .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with well a 1 km / h through North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie gained only 150 years of experience .
&quot; the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k covers the ground of the North Atlantic at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it reaches an average of 1.@@ 220 metres . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five meters long animal speeds up 2.8 km / h - and is with this top speed half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
&quot; this long @-@ term lifestyle , however , seems to be a silver bul@@ let for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from Greenland , the 3@@ 92 . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity &quot; , &quot; commented by Alexander Sch@@ adventurous , from the Max Plan@@ ck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life @-@ span , which means for ver@@ teb@@ rates a world record . &quot;
&quot; although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie can be painted . &quot;
only fl@@ ashed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin @-@ coastal co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive at the surface only in winter . &quot;
&quot; through the lifestyle of the Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie researchers , researchers know accordingly a little . &quot;
her tim@@ es@@ up@@ ent@@ emp@@ o moder@@ ation she when they covered six animals with a transm@@ itter .
&quot; loo@@ t make this shar@@ ks anyway : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the rem@@ n@@ ants of a Rob@@ be , another had sw@@ allowed the pine trees of a young ice cream . &quot;
possibly they chase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for car@@ c@@ asses that are from higher water layers to the bottom .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues were examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as examples from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long , while the largest 5@@ 02 cen@@ timeters . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the carbon @-@ 14 method of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the ey@@ lin@@ se arises before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a great deal of carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ tel .
&quot; therefore , their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s than nuclear @-@ weapon , larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the length of 220 cen@@ timeters in the length of the smallest animal , the lin@@ sen@@ ing had suffered a low shot of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it might be celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all the bigger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , in their lenses , had regular carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 o &apos;clock showed for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeters in Greenland a age of 335 years , during the record shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 cen@@ timeters even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ females only get rep@@ lied , if they are longer than four metres , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length were assigned to an age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ timeters become probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined , Grön@@ land is obviously obvious at least half a half and a half . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; also the previous record holder , an 211 year old Greenland of Greenland , in whose sp@@ eck at N@@ ack was a 120 year old Har@@ p @-@ tip , was caught up Alaska . &quot;
due to the low temperatures often the organism of the animals living there live on as@@ parag@@ us .
they mature so later - and age @-@ slower .
&quot; in order to warm up in cold water , the animals are also often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal sheds light . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is thus more dangerous and should focus on it as soon as possible to have as many offspring as early as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot;
a very big animal should invest more in a long life rather than in a long life .
construction in a double @-@ pack
&quot; with themes relating to the building of the building , the community at the recent session has been very focused . &quot;
&quot; with relief the committee took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the younger living dwell@@ ings can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the property , par@@ cel@@ li@@ cal and evaluation issues , and the applications for measurement could be clari@@ fied , is the sale of the plots in the living areas &quot; tr@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ strasse - C@@ uring section 1 ) to prosp@@ ective buyers nothing more in ways . &quot;
the council is convinced that the streams in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and cour@@ ageous people are alike .
&quot; as it meant , buildings can immediately report on the city hall above the en@@ core of the plots , the council is expected to advise on its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; to also request questions about the her@@ mits of other commercial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , decided to re @-@ decided to re @-@ establish the council , which only occurred in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the field of sub@@ mar@@ n the commercial region is extended by two plots in direction of State Road . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the city of Main , therefore , in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg will continue to attract the best opportunities for London to rel@@ oc@@ ated jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence Financial Markets and Markets Markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money buildings continue to operate from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; EU passport &quot; &quot; it extends to the United Kingdom so far . &quot;
these are just big US banks .
several banks have already announced their jobs .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; accounts for five years with 10000 new jobs at the Main Event . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight over the largest banks in the euro area , and further important authorities such as European insurance supervision ( EI@@ O@@ PA ) and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is head@@ quartered , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the reserve is important for banks , as they can communicate so directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg also insist on a large fund sector , cutting , but as well as in the infrastructure of the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city with easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in the Seine , the renting for first @-@ class business units are also higher than 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
Frankfurt also offer a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
&quot; in a ranking of corporate consulting Mer@@ cer , the city is placed in place seven , Luxembourg on position 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7. place . &quot;
&quot; even if a quality of life would be a question of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could draw further banks and investors , &quot; consequently the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um &apos;s most important financial center in Europe , I will think the business researchers . &quot;
&quot; the forces of forces in London also speak according to numbers of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the industry sectors , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C Pat@@ ent@@ ance with Mer@@ ck
&quot; a U.S. minist@@ ries decided that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to a refund of the legal costs , which you have ar@@ isen from the Hep@@ ati@@ te C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;

Mer@@ ck tries to uni@@ fy with Gilead that domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , as Gilead , and Mer@@ ck meet each other def@@ endants and property to work at lab , the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir River , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;

Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % Federal control
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton announced their tax declaration on Friday for 2015 , this y@@ iel@@ ded an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective average tax rate of 34,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons of USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton had an income of USD 3 million by the Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on their term of office in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons candidate for the Vice President , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax allow@@ ances of the last ten years . &quot;
you paid an effective average tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; announced Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a cr@@ ashing contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hidden behind false exc@@ uses and rep@@ atri@@ ation in relation to his previous promises to publish its tax allow@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential data to publish their tax allow@@ ances , although they are not obliged to do so . &quot;
&quot; tru@@ mp , a New York busin@@ es@@ sman , and his lawyers have stated as the reason for its denial a tax check by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; you are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s special consultant , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to release something before tax insp@@ ections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things , the Republi@@ can presidential did@@ acy of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney have already heard that his ref@@ us@@ al issues relating to assets , his donations to charitable organisations , its business communities and various other compounds , and in particular with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already led to the subject and published on Friday a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp call for its tax return . &quot;
on Thursday she spoke the subject during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
he refused to do what every other presidential did@@ acy has done in recent decades and its tax allow@@ ances &apos; . she said to the crowd .
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s , and a economic journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax companies and control advis@@ ors that may be the case . &quot;
federal control has become a subject in the elec@@ toral campaign .
&quot; Clinton supports a regulation , named after billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure people spend more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal as well .
&quot; during a campaign event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters to exchange Tru@@ mp at a meeting in order to exchange their tax allow@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said , he was also subjected to a tax check of IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp &quot; fear &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ tons campaign brought back tax declaration until 2007 .
&quot; Clin@@ ics now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average an effective average tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.@@ 5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax declaration of Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of its income as wage , unlike most of all the Americans . &quot;
&quot; your main financial system was a cost @-@ effective index fund , for which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues of USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 are tax@@ ed . &quot;

Jewish director strikes Berlin Hotel because Israeli Pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots ent@@ s@@ worn a media record , after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli elections , as it could have requested Arab guests according to an employee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his trouble at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann Israel tried to find Israel on the site op@@ tionally list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to use Israel via its own call center . &quot;
after a statement looking forward the director turned to the hotel .
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; looked upon him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; the hotel presented , that the measure is an &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it was , extingu@@ ished in the director even more jo@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they demanded that the pres@@ election is deleted , the author of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli amb@@ assador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ Chamber called this a &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were dispos@@ ed of this event and troubled .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
&quot; the fact that this in Germany has attributed to this hotel chain , is even greater shame . &quot;
this does not require an explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the Am@@ t@@ inners . &quot;
&quot; the incident , a fairly large reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people saw the whole sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; some under@@ posed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that there would have been the alleged &quot; demands of Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as@@ ham@@ ed you , &quot; was it called in another post that was noted that the hotel , which is located at the no@@ ver@@ sible Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dismis@@ sed all the accus@@ ations of itself and called the incident , &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct assignment , &quot; Israel to enter the quick@@ set list , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a speaker of Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code was now added .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian amb@@ assador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an in the year is equal to 7@@ 0.6 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest in both sides of Russian companies grew strongly influenced by the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors with the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
Russian companies have existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trade building is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he comm@@ ited that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.6 percent compared to the same period in 2015 increase and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amo@@ unted $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade break was reached by supplies of machinery , country @-@ vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ assador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes to Russia for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian deployment of around 35.@@ 000 vis@@ as , first and foremost known as travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of countries which concerns the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; you could say that record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something from which the amb@@ assador hopes to change . &quot;
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes at home when Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last evening in the men &apos;s bike Spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory as the British team def@@ acted the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , which had made his governor Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the J@@ umping and made the legend that he stor@@ med home to hide a victory from the Favorites of New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England stressed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y fet@@ ched the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ old@@ med@@ a@@ medals . &quot;
they repeated the trick after it took place in March at the train World Championship in London despite the back @-@ held Ho@@ ys only one modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver &apos;s Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as a Hin@@ des .
Ho@@ ys retired , be@@ got a gap , the ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton were trying to close . &quot;
Sk@@ inner was the man when they stayed there when they saw potential in the vill@@ i that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y vict@@ orious - and Sk@@ inner sat in the qualifying rounds of a Olympic ord , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ able vict@@ orious the New Zealand in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ des after his round was almost back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner was held . &quot;
a strategy change made a large part of the transformation that led to the Hin@@ des in a higher gear to slow him and allow Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as an BBC expert and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and to make a name .
we have set up a Olympi@@ as well in the final and the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to gain this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des that he fell to the train after a weak start . &quot;
he later moved this statement later and there was no objection of England ri@@ vals .
in such an un@@ rag@@ ged victory this time was not such a problem .
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; It feels like the whole GB fl@@ ags on the Tri@@ bun@@ es like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; we have been so badly wrong with so many international titles , that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the realm of Pos@@ sible that he has repeated the victory of three oly@@ mp@@ ic gold medals in a contest . &quot;
&quot; this would mean for Kenn@@ y - that &apos;s exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , which was also born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - mean an out@@ ute of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
cheese is the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team @-@ event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ nights . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medalli@@ sts of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the fourth @-@ four @-@ mile races . &quot;
they came to 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world record , which was in London Gold won in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 0,@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; today , the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with certainty . &quot;
&quot; he had suffered yesterday with officers in front of the qualification , as the function@@ aries to himself to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the appropriate Frauen@@ b , the tomorrow continued and ended , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archives soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World tre@@ k@@ ord@@ ings in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team leaves itself on its strong railway cycling team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and pick up a ch@@ ar of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional depic@@ tion of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were driven down . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Dr@@ amas played in the background as the resign@@ ation of the Technical Officer Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of Sex@@ ism and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ l@@ aps , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees itself the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary call of GB@@ s that has reached the perfect moment its climax again . &quot;
future of mel@@ ting port from Port@@ land due to lifting the current consumption
&quot; the future of the aluminum bar of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - standing on the game , since the operator operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply agreement , and thus to raise all delivery contracts , such as the supplied energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the decision by the government in Victoria beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a sub@@ committee for 20 years will run in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
&quot; not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect , could be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed at a closing time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ating effects as the mel@@ t@@ ings consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ zer@@ ei , which led last year to a closing of the angl@@ es@@ ea power plant . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risk a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation with regard to the future of the system , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity prices of the system . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the great aluminum bar with his Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three other owners are termin@@ ated their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L is assum@@ ing that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity through mel@@ t@@ ings , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts made so @-@ called &quot; &quot; h@@ amm@@ ers &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 onwards . &quot;
the contracts will have a 12 @-@ month period of cancellation so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; from that , AG@@ L is assum@@ ing that the contracts will be contributing to the revenue by the financial year in the financial year , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong terminals for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L shared with that it has already written the value of the Tre@@ aties in its annual amount of $ 187 million in the anticip@@ ation of a cancellation .
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; &quot; ability to operate or to ensure the power supply to the mel@@ t@@ apping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company told that there was a 20 @-@ year contract concluded with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have entered into force by November this year , even if there is still a declaration , why it was resign@@ ed from the contract . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st war@@ n due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , before the possible closing of the Port@@ land sh@@ utter in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility close to New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land is using about 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; if both plants flow from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as power producers that would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a car@@ path@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the sep@@ tum of the Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ omin@@ ator , 20 , Model and fourth subsidiary of the manager and mother of Carnival Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand amb@@ assador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and went on to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers brought me to the wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; reve@@ aling the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s like family ? ) , sear@@ ched Reality video that shows all the card@@ holder and producers of Ke@@ eping up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she conclu@@ des the cover of her sister , and ends with a classic turn : they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the cl@@ ums@@ y action in almost every birthday party in a children &apos;s shipment ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the proposition , &quot; &quot; Ask a sign that we had forgotten ? &quot; , &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon at 8 am in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to leave their other girl somehow at this public@@ city . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the sep@@ tum of Vo@@ gue , security has begun a new era of career . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes to see what the Vo@@ gue Cover , did ( her and her husband K@@ any@@ e West had to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the sep@@ t@@ ember of the magazine is a League for itself . &quot;
the September @-@ September release is the most sought after issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , similar to an image band like a fashion theme , the output moves a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of its cover stars will be so lon@@ addi@@ ctive that in the last two years pictures of the magazine oo@@ zes before the official announ@@ cements .
&quot; women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &apos; celeb@@ rities , the Model@@ n &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ rities &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ brand amb@@ assador Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ omin@@ ator - that is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough @-@ model &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or Reality stars or young people of today who know how to reverse a good snap@@ chat video ( even if it does all apply to each of the den@@ omin@@ ator ) .
they are truly talented women who exc@@ ite themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once was released on the last cover with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade on one of the most successful years of her career .
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers will not like every one . &quot;
&quot; with her Reality @-@ TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always tense in the fashion world . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret Model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ den@@ omin@@ ator and their colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her &quot; the Mist@@ y of the moment . &quot;
these feelings aw@@ aken again as the message with the show J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but to ride on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut the point seems to be present at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ den@@ omin@@ ator is in the cover of the sep@@ tum of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold from her noticed pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the German magazine X@@ Y .
and in their spare time it is seen in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centers present every year 16@@ 0.000 people
&quot; more than 160,000 of the aid of the country is rejected annually by the municipal centers , while the industry is taking place on the effects of further medi@@ ations on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland there are already three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y people , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just delic@@ acy and the similar ones - with their looking for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already swe@@ eping , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , this legal centers will lose another 30 percent of its federal resources . &quot;
&quot; the Director of the Municip@@ ality centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municip@@ al centres y@@ iel@@ ded , that thousands of people will be rejected every year . &quot;
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a abolition of the decision of the German government would only be worse .
&quot; Queens@@ land &apos;s municipal centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with uns@@ ett@@ able and impressive debt , families that have been dismis@@ sed through separation - all these people have problems of legal manner and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means thousands of help people need to be forced out of Queensland with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we demand the general interest and judicial finance ministers as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these mid@@ ations , so that people need help they need to get in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the provincial government filled its commitment to lift funds for legal assistance to national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customer communities , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp campaign was indic@@ ted by staff to put a weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was charged because of alleged in@@ action , after it was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina was directed to an employee , while they were on a je@@ ep in February in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident was described in a indic@@ t@@ ment , which was submitted on Wednesday in the provincial course of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini gave off to have waited for monthly , that the issue would be regulated internally before it re@@ alized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a gun , laid his right foref@@ inger on the withdrawal , and r@@ amm@@ ated the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; there was Bord@@ ini in his indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; after being tried during the local and regional campaign guide , Bord@@ ini had noted that at least four more people had the same experience with Philli@@ p , he gave himself the indic@@ t@@ ment in the indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; weapons do not have to be rep@@ ented to damage damage , there was on board . &quot;
the indic@@ t@@ ment occurs only two days after the republi@@ can presidential did@@ acy to be a tur@@ mo@@ il in North Carolina said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; was said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - would take action when his Ri@@ val@@ ine Hill@@ ary Clinton should be chosen and judge judges .
Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign clearly stated that media would have cus@@ hi@@ pped his words from the context and that he would not raise violence .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey in front of countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4th ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are significant losses for the SPD &apos;s government and CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; these were representative surveys of the public research institutes IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government , in the north of almost further gover@@ n , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both Länder , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances to face the Prime Minister . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD over@@ threw the SPD from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent in five years . &quot;
&quot; according to survey , the party saw only just under the CD@@ U who could come back to 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is controversial from the left and the Af@@ D disp@@ uted .
the left che@@ ap@@ ed at 19 percent ( before 18.@@ 4 percent ) that Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country @-@ day .
&quot; in spite of mild losses with 6 per cent ( before 8,@@ 7 percent ) in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent in the country with 3 percent .
&quot; in the Berlin event , the SPD of the survey states that only 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28,@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; it is still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but above the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the dep@@ ut@@ ational house .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return to return the pir@@ ate would be forced against it in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in Zeit@@ l@@ upe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors today domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device wo@@ g almost a half kil@@ og@@ ram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger it was therefore not good at hand .
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite cyclop@@ edia . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , the built @-@ in store was at the beginning of eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would range today for about two sel@@ ections with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gig@@ abyte .
&quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros you can buy the devices still on the internet , but they originate somehow from the stone @-@ time of the dormit@@ ory age . &quot;
20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the Computer@@ messe C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the west of the West . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
even access to websites was possible via HTML @-@ browser if also slow .
a paper@@ back was available - a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small ant@@ enna and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black / white screen .
&quot; quite proud , the price was : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , therefore about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany lay at 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could see in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile phone @-@ card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented d@@ aster , was finally sold and handled in Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , we master the market today , all came later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere , this is for very many people &apos;s everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; sold around 1,@@ 4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple exp@@ ire alone 555 million pieces . &quot;
worldwide sales with the equipment is about 400 billion euros .
&quot; to this end , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and the telecommunications company . &quot;
around the smartphone in the meantime an entire industry has emerged .
&quot; only at the beginning of 2007 , Apple @-@ Chief Steve Jobs was announced at the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet @-@ communication ator , everything by touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market . &quot;
they disappeared after all the Black@@ berry has to fight .
we now have Apple and asi@@ an providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is about 20 years after his invention a matter of course .
&quot; in the inc@@ ision , each German now looks at every 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we must all learn to put the smartphone even once , &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens @-@ Committee for staff . &quot;
continuous availability is now considered a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must channel the oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and bro@@ aden ho@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only used in our local municipalities and throughout London but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
&quot; for me , it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as it was in London in 2012 , when we had a great deal of effort to make sure all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will come again by creating new opportunities for resident and firms near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities we will be already 10,000 new appr@@ enti@@ ces to create 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly and they will be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any given question . &quot;
such as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for a single infrastructure project .
&quot; extension is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and throughout the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 b@@ ably investment program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years , as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequ@@ ented paths of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London Olympic Games have been a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we direct these oly@@ mp@@ ic mind and create He@@ ath@@ row as well as create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ game &quot; regarding ad @-@ blocking
&quot; for companies that deserve to earn money with online @-@ making money according to one of the software manufacturers , indication block , a &quot; &quot; cross and mouse @-@ game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad @-@ blo@@ wn on its desktop side , released Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ gger where users could update their filters during the program to re @-@ block advertising on social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the coding about his advertisements in order to make it ad lock@@ ings on which part of the page advertising is to complain . &quot;
but Ad@@ block proclaimed that there has been a new way to deal with new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ post , the spokes@@ man wrote by Ad@@ block Ben Williams that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ und @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the open @-@ flo@@ cking Open Source Community and the um@@ bers has already been underway since the invention of ad cour@@ iers , and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world @-@ largest company has left its social media into the struggle , is a strong indication of how worrying indicators for the industry has become . &quot;
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe at 200 million people indicator @-@ lock@@ ers , almost four times a lot of 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with eight billion daily active users , who access Facebook through their mobile devices , makes hand@@ y@@ value 84 per cent of the impact of advertising on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; the company has it on display blocks on desktop PCs aside , since mobile ad blocking does not have any effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient proportion of revenues , so that Facebook appears to be an investment of such a step as rewar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would be an &quot; &quot; scor@@ ching tool &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over it . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks of new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page , which are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this does not represent a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , an spokes@@ person shared by Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; indicator blocks , a static means , which is why we have focused instead on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
Mrs with suspected su@@ ic@@ ide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witness to a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday with a thought su@@ ic@@ ide by several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman placed himself in the Dark Ones in an act of desp@@ air , &quot; on the streets and were struck by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a silence at the age of 49 years , made by several vehicles , including a truck , he wanted to kill himself . &quot;
it died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police that calls them as well as any witnesses of the incident in order to report . &quot;
&quot; it was opened a investig@@ ating process , what a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation is divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something what the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable .
&quot; in each of the two cases - when a person ran into the Dark on the highway - was decided that the drivers don &apos;t need to assume that a pedestrian middle night on the highway runs , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year a police officers was released , after having killed a man and killed , who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had dr@@ unk and has become unconscious on the road .
&quot; the court pointed out that the police had responded to a call -- to a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was an &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should report the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Klim@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once inhabited
Venus was probably do@@ cked according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model probably once .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate researchers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could be recorded with their hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once @-@ like conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere , and nevertheless slowly turned slowly . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet was presum@@ ably more dry areas as de earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to host lives and quickly sc@@ orer . &quot;
early Venus prof@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation exp@@ oses the slow revers@@ al of Venus its twi@@ sts of the sun almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which acts as a rain @-@ cut , to prevent the surface of a large part of the sun heat . &quot;
&quot; the results are average temperatures , which are some degree of cooler than that of the earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution , which was previously assumed by Plan@@ etary researchers . &quot;
even though she was probably hab@@ itable was the Venus -- over the course of several billion years --@@ too much heat and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light .
their oceans di@@ ets and their water v@@ ap@@ or was burned from the ultr@@ avi@@ olet light .
&quot; as their hydr@@ gen , there remained only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate movement in ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

&quot; over the course of summer , I thought much and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth to give it a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations has to be perfectly adapted to the organization . &quot;
he also must have a co @-@ determination in decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , which was raised in Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team . &quot;

Roy has received the award winner of Jack Ad@@ ams Awards during his debut appearance 2013 @-@ 14 as the best coach of the League .
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last years . &quot;
the description was made in season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ Card Spot in the Western Conference to get five points .

&quot; wood Group as well as the un@@ ites and trade unions can confirm that we have reached ourselves to restart the implementation process of current streaming , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks to start the start of next year to tackle the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has reduced the ranks of its counter@@ actors in the North Sea around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 @-@ percentage decline for on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company has the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to surrender his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it claims its business activities as a result of its meg@@ az@@ er@@ ties with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower resource @-@ prices under pressure , a economic situation , which was reinforced by the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish parliamentary member Dave Ander@@ son met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leadership , to discuss one of the greatest work@@ ings that occurred since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
the North Sea is important for the regional economy .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy , which works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,@@ 4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of about $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star@@ ters of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
&quot; the latest missions with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ coming tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers , the full catalog of rotation rates under the stars of the star@@ ters of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars in star@@ ters can be rotating with different racks as well as in the context of rotation periods with the planning of planning . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ isons of our results with other stars , read more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this constell@@ ation , which were created about 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood . &quot;
you are now on the fastest .
&quot; at peak @-@ level rates , these str@@ apping stars reach large quantities of star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a crus@@ hing effect on the stars . &quot;
when a star alter@@ t its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zes the time between the appearance of an recognizable star@@ fl@@ ap -- such as sun@@ spots --
the latest catalogue of Rot@@ ations@@ rates indicate that massive stars slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , and the larger stars slower the pi@@ rou@@ ets than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ball@@ et &quot; of Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be mass@@ aged , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ even of Pl@@ ei@@ ades the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still much ahead of us to know more about how the How , W@@ ann and why stars their rotation rates slo@@ wing down their &quot; dance gloves . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three periods in detail about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ adas , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star occurs
the tears ran by Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US @-@ bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days from base to base .
&quot; after his emotional set notice , the 41 years old professional debut on 12 August against Tampa Bay R@@ ays will last the tri@@ co@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye , &quot; the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected as the most valuable player of the League , 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature under a 10 @-@ year contract agreed to him 27 million US dollars annually .
&quot; until the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 , he will be able to act as a consultant and youth coach - with full content . &quot;
as a player there is a Rodri@@ guez long time with performance back .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es made it some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall of Fame @-@ Fame @-@ Fame H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , show two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values . &quot;
&quot; however , in the resting area of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old might not be recorded . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - Nickname &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field was , so disp@@ uted is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the Super@@ star provided with &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 banned ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked by the end of 2014 for 211 Parti@@ cipation by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is considered the main suspic@@ ious to have received for years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida .
after a dispute the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done me a favor for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without inter@@ missions , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez then sweet . &quot;
&quot; also , his far@@ ewell days did not go straight away . &quot;
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games have once again received the big stage Rodri@@ guez is often sitting on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include a far@@ ewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the actress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the actress Kate , Hudson releases of the fans of Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ riv@@ al Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; s@@ angen the pend@@ ant at 4 : 9 @-@ defeat for the Rodri@@ guez team . &quot;
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first D@@ op@@ ing@@ accidents
&quot; know : because of a positive d@@ osing sample , wei@@ ghting Adrian Ziel@@ inski may not start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
a caught ath@@ l@@ ete could have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ accidents have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; the Chinese swimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa were tested positively and excluded in Brazil - immediately prior to the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions this news go to the un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , Ch@@ en has been proven the Di@@ ure@@ tics for hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ quer@@ ading means for dop@@ ing instances . &quot;
the International Spor@@ Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon on Friday night and exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the finals over 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds they missed the bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the pre @-@ ring over 50 m of open @-@ style . &quot;
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; the national trade union takes the matter &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ sman CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the sanctions of the ath@@ l@@ ete with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio sick@@ le the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV stations B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; stated the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act in the promised substance around the blood @-@ offering EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended in preliminary , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should already be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w re@@ directed immediately with criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not drag the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; we are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; this way , roughly all the weights from the chron@@ ically @-@ offering nation do not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case of &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; was announced that London @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ ons was tested in the class up to 85 kg , such as its brother Tomas@@ z three days had been positive on the an@@ ab@@ ole Ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both cover the intake , both may not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the lightweight , the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF had banned the whole Russian team up to an exception because of systematic di@@ op@@ ings , and the runners of Kenya produces numerous poor news in Rio . &quot;
in swimming sports the former promises in China had also taken care of fier@@ ce disputes between athletes .
so the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t reached the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of freedom , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French Radio . &quot;
sun stood at the center of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positive in the Chinese Championships on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de in 2014 , but only had a three @-@ month block . &quot;
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de @-@ pressen h@@ ackers their ran@@ som
programmer from Er@@ press@@ ors are currently targeted companies - and have been successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of Mal@@ ware @-@ Ab@@ wehr experts Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months at least once , partly several victims of an attack with black@@ smith software . &quot;
almost 20 percent of the companies have already been the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware ext@@ or@@ tion .
40 percent of the victims paid will@@ ingly prepared by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators Speci@@ alise their pres@@ ences software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attack attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential sol@@ vent ran@@ som significantly higher than by individuals . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of harm software , &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then we discovered the perpetrators of ext@@ or@@ tion software for itself .
&quot; only private users were the goal , but the change to company att@@ acking was frigh@@ tening quickly during the past months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware operates according to a simple sample : once on the computer of an offering , she looks targeted to any changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encrypted the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the pres@@ pres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; to get the files code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where with private users the personal photo database is at stake , it is related to companies for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a Ran@@ som@@ ware suggests . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German firms affected by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to fully inter@@ rupt their operations , in case of a case , people were in life danger . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attack , their patients may be threatened by the loss of in@@ firm@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pays off , you just encourages the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , their data will be back . &quot;
&quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators , given a stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ackers broke this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure expl@@ ores the user surfaces and contact with the investig@@ ators and come to the result : the perpetrators are trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain to their sacrific@@ es by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free on @-@ accessible support websites or de@@ code for example files . &quot;
&quot; and individuals are rede@@ emed by payments of a few hundred billion euros , companies have to negotiate slightly hard and earned five @-@ dig@@ it sums in order to reg@@ ain their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ ext@@ or@@ tion , the h@@ ackers become more professional and share the work , the security exper@@ te Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski of the Anti@@ virus supplier &#93; : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is likely that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their claims software then in the form of a software building to the actual ext@@ ents .
&quot; the previous Mal@@ ware kits created by the mal@@ ware themselves , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; in delivery included is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and brand@@ ing can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the black@@ smith are then looking for further h@@ ackers to distribute the fresh software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log@@ ged in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a crime and assigned a further way to install the software on as many PCs . &quot;
the payment is made at a fixed calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then bear sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that make their data better secure .
&quot; more than 50 percent of the companies in the Mal@@ war@@ p@@ y@@ tes survey will trust in the Mal@@ war@@ p@@ y@@ tes survey , the ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data only does not sufficient threat for successful withdrawal , the perpetrators are instead with the release of sensitive information such as customer list or pri@@ c@@ cul@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the damage potential is higher than before the type of data is higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetrators could also take totally new goals in the Internet of things to the cor@@ n . &quot;
&quot; on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers , as they could get a thermo@@ stat under their control using the Internet . &quot;
in the middle of winter the free@@ wheel of such a block heating would be quite a ran@@ som worth .
&quot; if the offen@@ ders then instead block the heating in future a whole manufacturing street in a factory , the ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in the Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack it all : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pe and even the versatility of a Mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds fairly over@@ load , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz , proves to be quite flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have much space in the front row as well as in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ side falls apart . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage space .
&quot; it is not only a trunk area of 45@@ 3 l under high @-@ made and 10@@ 26 l with folded back , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is less magical , than it sounds : the surfaces of the back @-@ wall can be high @-@ valves and thus offer storage space , which is high up to the ceilings 1,@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk @-@ room is well loaded , but the charging height is 650 mm slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1,6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 PS speeds up to the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide turn@@ key areas very powerful .
but he is likely to do his work a little qui@@ eter .
&quot; pleas@@ ing is the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km . &quot;
there is another engine isation : a 1.5 @-@ l gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a general drive is not offered .
driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
the steering is likely to be a little bit more direct .
equipment in the tested top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; does not be desired .
&quot; among the safety systems , the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ assistant ( works up to pace 32 ) , the coll@@ ision war@@ ns and the sp@@ ur@@ ning assistant . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ ns sometimes , because he assessed as many obstacles as &quot; her@@ edit@@ ary objects &quot; . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works of the remote @-@ assist@@ ent .
and the intelligent tempor@@ al code respon@@ ds to the road detection and d@@ ros@@ selt at need the speed .
&quot; but full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are lying under the arm@@ rest and therefore are something aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well equipped top diesel are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , will receive the gas@@ oline from 200@@ 00 euro , the diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 emissions .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and single @-@ friendly car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : overthrow on a flight bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the plane of air .
&quot; for one liability is conceivable only in danger , the typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Upper district Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the r@@ ack@@ et had broken down on the overthrow a knee br@@ ink .
&quot; however , the accident could have been occurring everywhere - it is an overall risk of living , so the dish . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .

&quot; after their journey , holi@@ day@@ makers get back money after their journey , if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly to be found in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; but that is only the case , if more than ten percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in which case a family was hard on the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ oise , hard to diar@@ rhe@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
&quot; your condition led the holi@@ day@@ makers to a def@@ ective scale , which supposedly had poll@@ uted the sea@@ water . &quot;
&quot; the family was the view , the journey has been insufficient - and def@@ endant against the organis@@ ers . &quot;
in the court the cl@@ ans had no success .
although the plumbing was indeed def@@ ective .
but the organis@@ er was just shortly before leaving the applicant .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since in the samples of the water no contam@@ ination were found .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ agi@@ on among each other - belonging to the common sense risk .

the state bl@@ ur@@ ns and determined at the same time react to terror .
certain is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hat@@ red and spl@@ itting .
this triumph we will not treat the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country , the level of security and the strength of the population is also the consent of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ iz@@ ère wants to reach the implementation of proposals until the German Bundestag .
&quot; he also announced another personal strengthening of the security forces , and in the middle of medium @-@ phase sizes over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ etic of terrorism again stand under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weapons quite as novel@@ ty , that primarily the purchase of weapons will be complicated in the internet . &quot;
the last much discussed welding for doctors is meant to be del@@ ayed by de Ma@@ iz@@ ères .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the poorest countries , such as the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with views about psychological views . &quot;
&quot; to counter a radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social care for necessary . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ atis@@ ed people .

&quot; SPD Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister became clear against action against action . &quot;
&quot; this was a bracel@@ et for the sni@@ ff in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; Gabriel took the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke ME@@ DI@@ ENG@@ RU@@ P@@ PE ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Ma@@ iz@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ ins from the Union after a bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition and the abolition of double nationality .

better traffic flow at the Motor@@ tr@@ zu@@ br@@ inger
it is regularly on the Um@@ es road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , that is to change : the dispute is to be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all cars , who are on the road on the environmental road every night in the St@@ au when they drive over the motorway at Au@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the regional road construction extends to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , in the area between the hammer street and the departure of Wes@@ eler Street the right ab@@ bi@@ enni@@ al track at 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then go directly from the hammer street on the right .
the great advantage : the traffic will have an early stage whereby the overall consultation on the multi@@ lateral section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 has been improved .
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U Group in the district , representing Münster @-@ West . &quot;
driving on the fe@@ eder on the fe@@ eder drivers above all between 17 and 7 pm .
week@@ days dates back to bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ west road and sometimes even beyond .
&quot; for this reason , the needle is based on the B 51 just before the exit of Wes@@ eler Street . &quot;
&quot; from here , the traffic is only guided through the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be returned to three years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations made that the bridge does no longer have the required load force , in order to take in front of the heavy duty cycle . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated stamp will last , the competent country can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , it is to be reck@@ oned with years : for the bridge has an official rest @-@ use until the year 2034 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal down@@ turn , the regional operation deliberately picked up the busi@@ est times in the school holidays , because with disabilities is to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
the traffic will pass through on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the Theater@@ piece &quot; The invisible House . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
&quot; the Association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with a migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; at the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has an idea of winning the &quot; &quot; Inv@@ isible House &quot; &quot; of the boy The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the Association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; , 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes , within the framework of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and a little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scene of images and video animations , be it possible to follow the action yet to follow the press release of the Young theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; the Association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from Spr@@ ak@@ el , and the Young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December youths , with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years the opportunity receive professional training courses in the fields of vocals , dance , spectacle and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal game and the@@ atri@@ cal languages are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
given the increasing refugee numbers counting the association with many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of stars : hope to improve the weather
the weather has made the star@@ ters Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night for Friday a pier by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain bad to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chair of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ k@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see many star@@ ters at the sky . &quot;
&quot; with the star@@ ters , it is Per@@ sei@@ den , which belong with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the quick@@ est star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they appear seemingly out of the constell@@ ation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleep
&quot; in the evening , one gets etern@@ ally around , at night one is awake in the morning , in the morning it is far before the wake @-@ up cl@@ ing no longer to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , there is a good company with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of the adults of sleep , and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequent or permanent than not recovered . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many different reasons underlying them , stresses Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aks , the member of the German Society for Sle@@ ep Research and Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands it among them , but the in@@ som@@ nie , is thus an inhal@@ ation and a sle@@ e@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; exactly the sleep many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ fying or inadequate , says J@@ ens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Pre@@ anc@@ ellor of the German Haus@@ sman association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
&quot; organs can be organic , mental or loss @-@ related factors , but also medicines . &quot;
not rarely is the interference expression of another disease .
&quot; very early wake @-@ up is often used in a depression , &quot; says We@@ aks . &quot;
and it can be that various factors are printed .
&quot; who , for example , has a Band@@ shell case , can be bad , w@@ acht every two to three hours and always starts to greet you about everyday problems and -@@ care , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you cope with sleeping disorders for a doctor ?
&quot; who should not sleep well over a period of a month at least three nights per week , and in the day he should go to a doctor , betra@@ yed We@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; impair@@ ment may look very different : one is be@@ aten , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is slightly irrit@@ able , has difficulty fluctu@@ ations or bodily discomfort such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to all@@ evi@@ ate the sleep , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , among other behavi@@ oral changes , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping @-@ coated tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ question . &quot;
&quot; ra@@ inf@@ ant sle@@ eves in Germany can hardly be stressed in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Director of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should consult with sleep problems first to the doctor &apos;s doctor . &quot;
&quot; in case studies can be resolved , if the problems have a physical cause . &quot;
&quot; who should be in the dormit@@ ory , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for the study in the dormit@@ ory rates of medicine for example with snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory issues , in nursing care , or if you cannot find the cause of a sle@@ e@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; actually , you do not have to prepare for the investigation . &quot;
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a mid@@ day sheep , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the ch@@ asing you go to bed his normal time .
&quot; in addition to electro@@ des in the body you are wearing a nose glasses , a ni@@ ch@@ ord and a mu@@ zzle at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is characterized by the ceiling . &quot;
how can those affected the problems get in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of advertisements when you can sleep for better sleep .
&quot; thr@@ ust counts : regular bed@@ - and stand @-@ up times , not too long in bed lie on the day not sleeping , do not watch television to sleep , alcohol ste@@ er and at night not at the watch - then one begins to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has vo@@ iced by Facebook to dis@@ closing the D@@ SV team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he picked up gold for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler was placed in the criticism of the ex @-@ team @-@ team @-@ team @-@ mate .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000 € Pre@@ mie and an jungle bite in 15@@ 0.000 € should not be surprised about missing medals &quot; , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls on the other hand very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries which will promote and operate very much in the issue of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set down , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler needs to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot afford a certain amount of time before the World Cup / OS can be controlled by independent contro@@ l@@ le@@ uren from the W@@ ada / F@@ ina , may not take part , &quot; calls for the election of Hamburg , who now operates a ice cream . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of baggage was arrested
professional Di@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; civil events of the Düsseldorf , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer joined the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the tat@@ too had been committed as ban@@ de several ash@@ - and Che@@ ers .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civil servants involved in the area of the Airport Düsseldorf a gang that was known for the police officers from past theft . &quot;
the two women and two men had committed several deliber@@ ate since the mid July of this year and were consistent and particularly professional .
&quot; the specialists of the crime Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can be attributed to the Di@@ eben , which were imported to the opening of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four deeds . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had a total of about 15,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lenses , a couple of Lin@@ den@@ b@@ äum@@ chen , meanwhile , a rest of the stone @-@ stone @-@ buttons : the Rig@@ a@@ er street in Berlin @-@ fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in appears at first sight not so , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; one goes along the road from the east to the west , one gets to players , a refreshing kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
on the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a gray house someone has ugly ! &quot;
&quot; opposite from a Li@@ dl , which should also be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rentals . &quot;
&quot; article on this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; , &quot; as the responsible property company fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in calls , will be prefer@@ ed in the last weeks but preferred by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the ground is occupied with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants of rent , on the ground floor , however , are still spaces occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year H@@ enk@@ el H@@ enk@@ el had several times gone for a hard approach to police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police had issued three weeks of official statements according to 30 to 40 officials and three team @-@ cars on site , block parts of the street and held visitors from , the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile the renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on July 13 , a Berlin administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal and a day later served police and construction workers under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road peaceful : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ t@@ ained . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main number of inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the area since 1999 , and Jana * , who formed here three children , especially from the police presence . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern before increasing rental and g@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound according to an area that con@@ gru@@ ent police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ on left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , that of the Berlin inter@@ iors and the police between the land@@ lords and their neighbours , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; peaceful sha@@ sha@@ im in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which is also today in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average and high poverty of poverty . &quot;
&quot; house poss@@ essed also houses and the bor@@ ns residential projects have long been occupied for a long time since . in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under a large police force in a controlled right road , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who were occupied by 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the city district has become increasingly becoming a mag@@ net for tourists and elec@@ toral liner from all over the world : with them now they share the inhabitants of the GDR and former house @-@ owned offices . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the rental , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one det@@ ects them on war@@ ned sli@@ ces or fresh@@ ly rep@@ ain@@ ted fac@@ ades that were be@@ amed with color exploitation .
&quot; no other road has been mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ aut@@ on@@ ome force &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason is that not all neighbours might look at this as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury are based almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
the largest portion of the off@@ ences are making of atomic facts that tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rented house next to the controversial 94 , can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is trou@@ bles@@ ome : people in the 94 are their neighbours , which certainly do not have been . &quot;
even the famous fl@@ ashing cars put it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er even longer .
&quot; for the studied architect , her road is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately moved to the Rig@@ a@@ er street - and remained .
&quot; therefore , it was also so important that the inhabitants get back their street : from the police , politics and the media , who in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of the inhabitants , like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away : through reporting new buildings in former buildings that push the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately property apartments , which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well sear@@ ched , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction , I cannot be a@@ thei@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; but what should one do , if one never stops someone ? &quot;
&quot; there is frustration on all sides of frustration , including the police and the residents . &quot;
&quot; for the drawn , those like dy@@ bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the area . &quot;
who wants to be aware of it should be aware of this - just like someone who moves in a pub to complain there bad about noise .
&quot; all persons shown with first names have therefore asked , not to be called with their right name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee charge
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the response to the matters of integration and organizer .
&quot; in addition , it is a social worker on site . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le had been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees himself as a contact for all players : refugees , working group refugees , administr@@ ations , authorities and who else apart . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the icy w@@ ool @-@ m@@ ist who above all have a problem . &quot;
&quot; so some - less sp@@ ott@@ end , but rather on the variety of desire areas @-@ areas - targeted , as the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; sear@@ ched for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social labor , just an icy w@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; but administration is not its central area , suppose Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization working with people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as network value . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for six weeks .
it has a 50 percent focus on three years of time .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ors and main actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and constant problems . &quot;
return to new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; it has been a serious problem for some time , apartments for the joints that have been acknowledged . &quot;
for the connection of connection the municipalities are responsible .
you have to put refugees in their own or en@@ listed dor@@ ms .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the governor of the Comm@@ une and J@@ ob@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment . &quot;
the search has been designed as very difficult for some time .
de facto the management does not find private apartments .
&quot; so far , it is not so far , one can rely on private apartments , so called D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , non @-@ smoking apartments must be perf@@ ected as it is so nice . &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed lead , they are train@@ e@@ eship , training courses , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and the assistance of refugees and migrants that have to be found or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or help car@@ vers , do non @-@ profit work - and motivated and very tidy , as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day need a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
the people would have to develop a bearing @-@ being .
&quot; so , you need special offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are r@@ ar .
so we also jump in managing and volunteers .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must declare the refugees that it just takes and they can take the time to make sense , for example , with voice curve . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , that will never be integrated . &quot;
the distinct majority is motivated .
&quot; however , there is also what customers say honestly , &quot; people , where nothing goes . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always motiv@@ ate to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two after the recent occurr@@ ences fear of radic@@ alization , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher may call &quot; &quot; a Res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko could and want to exclu@@ de them however . &quot;
sensi@@ tised are the hel@@ pers however already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject of refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks they bring them completely into action .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with them , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and volunteers must hold out locally and in the region to activities .
they always in the background that soon a new Sto@@ cks would come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
needs Germany a ceiling ?
&quot; this issue is clear to answer , apart from politics . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place hel@@ pers on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet there , where we want to go &quot; , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would be able to relax . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher wrote already in order to incorporate the previous people sensible . &quot;
&quot; these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; however , if people are in need of aid , both women are united . &quot;
&quot; the political situation is so complicated , since there is no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bre@@ w @-@ helic@@ opter
the police helic@@ opter flew approximately one hour long and different areas - un@@ successful .
two un@@ familiar men are stuck in Fri@@ day@@ morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the people struck the two and hit the un@@ hol@@ de into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1.70 meters large , probably mas@@ ked , tru@@ sting both Blu@@ e@@ je@@ ans and black cap@@ tions . &quot;
they whis@@ per@@ ed in the direction of downtown .
&quot; at the end , the police set several stri@@ pe portions , as well as a police helic@@ opter . &quot;
the ground@@ ing ran out without success .
&quot; possibly the unknown before the apartment fell , close to the apartment or with their flight . &quot;
Baden @-@ Württemberg : police are determined by ro@@ cker attack on I@@ mb@@ iss
