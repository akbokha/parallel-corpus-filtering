<seg id="2">"sexual violence is one of women who flee alone, almost to everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen are four women sitting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He knitted with great eyes curious in the room.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene acts normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is the business leader of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance offers in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are whispered.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Münchner north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe."</seg>
<seg id="18">"however, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made upon their flight experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men escape because wars because they will be politically prosecuted, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as a hoppers to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women there are other reasons for the escape:" "many steal themselves secretly, because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary murder, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end once they anchoring in Germany, irre, tells us."</seg>
<seg id="31">Also here women in Refugees would often be considered inferior and worsen if abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in the residence in Münchner north, traumatised, appreciates it."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not made voluntary." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so normal that they have nothing to say.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often do not help you know, there are more accommodations only for them, urgency."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question, whether they are from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken, there are such a thing in the area of governments not."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in pigs, women are not accommodated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Press of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranken, there are some common floors or separate houses for women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the" "rights of women and gender equality" "in the European Parliament is calling for women to be accommodated separately from men."</seg>

<seg id="45">"if the privacy or men and women are accommodated together, it may come to - on-going - violence against women."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of aliens"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and an official end of the eight months of ongoing war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counterplayer in the gilded Hall of St. Petersburg's Palace in reception, I can not desing the expression that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the rash, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but putting Putin in the smile, and he found barely warmth, even for his withstanding conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke about his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level in front of the crisis, but even better."</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day she described a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard so would never happen to be anything worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to interpret his enthusiasm rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable radiant showed that the State of Russia had nothing forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory report: the downshot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was gone.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Putin made up and accused Ankara, Russia in the back."</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Vetrust is going to rebuild it becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"months the state-controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed to be the Turks for everything to blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the serious allegations, the allegations of leading officials were that Erdogan's own family profit from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria should have been controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has disputed this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg the official message was, that it was time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting was only taking place because Putin received the apgan as president of Erdogan, which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a cease-fire is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends who can get after spending last month at a failed state of almost his ministers.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repetitive terror attack on Turkey also have shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey harsh - especially ban charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is gone by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel plans and charter companies will be relieved if the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">You are counting on a late storm at the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week projected the state of cheap cheap fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agribusiness will be re-imported."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti is formulating:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West as it is a reaction to the attempted power supply as weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued Groll about the snail empiouo in the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the erpicht rises, out of cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian Heads of State won a bonus that he tried after the tried coup d" état support for the selected state organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a self-comprehensible for Moscow, which itself has a profound fear of regimeavals."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, a matter of how it was a analyst once described," "alliance of aliens", "two countries that are killed by the West and feel poorly treated."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still great differences."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference in Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey are contradictory."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after almost three hours of initial discussions, both Presidents were told at the press conference, that they had not even saved the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the president of Turkey committed it to answer any question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a perfect dispaster, when NATO member states like the Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two heads of State had at least once again talk."</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1,35 €expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have linked the North deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four verses of the" "mercy-blower" "which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">The brood-section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tilt-rope."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1,35 €expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Keith Brown, hosted by the construction site, was one of the first who went from the country to the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineers in a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which alone were used for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the cover between the viaduct and the brückendeck is a delicate occupation, which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, nearly 79% of the total stools down in their place and the last section of Decks gets a Betonguss for the Deck, which means that the entire Deck is ready to put on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first clasp is a significant milestone in each Bring project."</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project the deadline for future-oriented high-quality and low-construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last street covers and its connection with the northern deck, we had to then close the still existing gap on the north or country side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by dragging the northern feeder bridge of 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, since the viaduct 222 meters long is, about 6,000 tons and had to be dragged in a slope of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"secretly, since the tolerances, on which the team has been working, tiny - on each side they retains only a few millimetres."</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Green my: investors should be raised much more strongly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "action concept" to the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But arguments is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all about the question: who is supposed to build the favorable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is lacking so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD Vice-President Christoph Bratmann says:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas in future, it must be 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable apartments can also be found in the inventory.</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big dispute point in the city hall is however, as Bratmann:" how do you want to build investors who want to build on private areas? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent, but as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing program, which costs millions of cost and has to be financed."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as violas:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left is still looking for tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"irrespective of what Bratmann, vane is a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"action concept is implemented, will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"yet, the program is not entirely destroyed: for the around 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"how do you compare the loss of other about 1,300 cheap apartments, whose support will run over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020, it will be 500 apartments alone."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, so the planner spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought from the city now."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to get back home again."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western town.</seg>
<seg id="26">One fell on one stroke will solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">"for in the western town, the end of the dates are running out."</seg>
<seg id="28">"around 1800 apartments, one could get back to the price of cheap apartments."</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in this way, the number of social housing in the Western city is dramatically increased dramatically, away from the goal of the so-called penetration."</seg>
<seg id="31">There is no longer a concentration of social-weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the Greens expect that there will be even movement in the discussion."</seg>
<seg id="33">"leader Holger Herlitschke says:" "for a wide majority, the CDU have to start with the boat."</seg>

<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you're approaching from the front or from the back, this video will show you how you can turn for your predator."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you are approaching from behind, then you should turn out to be the first so that you can see your attacker and move out of the dirt line," says Mizrachi. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then hit him with the knee into the groste, and twisting you, while the attacker attacks against pain, the weapon from his hands. strike it with the run into the face and move backwards while she set the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers that approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the nut line, grab the weapon and rotate them, so that the attacker can not shoot."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British stimuli underwent his immune system and throws of a serious test - by changing some of the narrower and ecompous places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the Moderator and Marautor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk broke his course on a Euro Schadilly Circus, a dishwasher at Piccadilly Circus, a dish-knob of a tractor toilette as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before the check-out of each object, he used a latometer to show up and show us what he will let themselves."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment made under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength "," brought some surprising results to daylight. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, to cover the dishknob of a Zugtoilette that has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually are in a kitchen sink more poor bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical specialists about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he hid, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was well known to test the resilience of its intestine, travelling through the world and fun, as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to railings up to sink of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitely below a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told me:" "already as a child I was relatively unworried about what my health concerns and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and hammers."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">"that which he ran, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">His procal-line showed a luminous number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to the luminous number of fresh hands amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused, after their luminous number over 4000 units were, while freshly woven hands have less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "this comes the worst thing I got into a toilet, near."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will do nothing here because it is indoors here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equipment Mr. Wright with Valio Aviilus, which contains both the lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valid Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer the consumer really something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explain the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we led crazy brainstormings, which made that we said" Lass us Ian call. "</seg>
<seg id="26">Claiming that the interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we were able to provide more information on an interesting manner."</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added:" let me be so saying - I would have lost my respect for Ian when he'd suffered my respect for Ian, which I have relied to him as the ekelous Russian toilet that is shown in the movie. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things where it was easier to bring to Ian, she anzlick and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we have added some of these dirty goodies to film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a valid survey conducted by 2015 in 2015, 84 per cent of all respondents were lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent, that they have at least occasionally produce products, the attached lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="25">"and at some points - in the unequal treatment of geological, for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizère, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">"but it cannot be in speech, that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg refugees were displaced."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people faced with the high refugee concerns about safety."</seg>

<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the sophisticated recling of holdings is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects but to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all predictive at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely trial group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hormone by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while I am in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a humble stop, and wildly scant before I stand and something determinating like:" so, let us take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Sohos is slowly introduced to his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate-specific stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops, and try to estimate their age and mind through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I by Sister Ray (Data Number: two young women, three men middle age) into the Reckless Records (Data Number: eight men middle age, a woman, presumably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>

<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of its available income: it is now able to buy plates that he was not able to afford, when they had appeared, and again to purchase items that he sold as he was young and bankrupt."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things that I was probably something to young in order to buy it," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records, more introverted and would like to spend time:" I don't smoke and I don't smoke very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meets the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people that will be influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and let themselves be able to purchase their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually have deed themselves to 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">That would declare the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to recognize that record-shop provides a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to retreat to the stability of familiar soundproofs, of objects, the happy Jugenderinnings."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a emptiness or possessions of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "says WZ."</seg>

<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from one computer or in other way but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>

<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees it - perhaps because they are only pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate-art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is most for luxury items like plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my postforappointments take up that the results of YouGov vote, they leave at least into turntables in Soho, the large number of female collectors and records, which exist in reality, turntables and online-forefors."</seg>

<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday tomorrow with certainty not by plate through records of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while taking the rigid look of an uncanny, 30-year wrong moderator, who raged over the shoulders of the middle age."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court has rejected an offer of authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live, down-down."</seg>

<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for expulsion of people who operate 72 provisional businesses, but spatial ideas that concerns the prefecture of Calais." "</seg>

<seg id="28">The former groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.</seg>

<seg id="30">This is worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the scene of attack on asylum seekers were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated criminal prosecution or trailers of the right scene."</seg>

<seg id="3">Demonstrators are demanding political changes in Ethiopia if they were calling for violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protested during the clashes with the police were killed in shouting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years it was one of the most vulnerable countries in Africa, a solid ally of West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last few months, the protests against the government and widespread protests against the government, and more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people hit the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was not merciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were on zig unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, the videos on the protests supported by the last or early of this year, show how security people were to hit with blocks, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now calling for an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to stop this land and in future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence agencies work closely with Ethiopians, to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy is expanding in a respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pitch in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet and safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia has been anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereby dissidents were effective to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments that cover all from the ground-use to the stranglehold with regards to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far-reaching criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this zacked, controversial line called in June hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists as the Oromo-liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less enforced in recent years, the turbulence and flows again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of having to explode under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media, because cheap smartphones are becoming more frequent and improved the Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government keeps access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate about internet-proxies, which hide where they are going."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians have given that they gathered so among protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnies in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons prospered the Amharas, which come from equivalescence in the majority of Ethiopia, in politics and economy, while they have been the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flat land areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Miechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have felt that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which is dominated by approximately 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in military services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former vine leader, was until his death at a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopians."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as tactical genius, a man who was able to think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analyst say that he was particularly versed to use early signs of discontentment and special, to edit opponents and make them unharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime is lacking in this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopians of new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively inscrutable reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"different from Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of Northern Africa, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say he did not enjoy the trust of the controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia was experienced such a turmoil, after thousands of elections protested by the analysts were seemingly fueled by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raid, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormality of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month of the protesters in Gondar, an ambi City, of Tigray guided shops and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more efficient in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests and other Western allies have a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though she recently investigated that she has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want to be together in a already volatile area."</seg>

<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five meters long animal speeds up 2.8 km / h - and is with this top speed half as fast as a Robbe."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this long-term lifestyle, however, seems to be a silver bullet for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "at any rate from Greenland, the 392."</seg>

<seg id="13">Only flashed the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-haie are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin-coastal coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive at the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">"through the lifestyle of the Greenland-haie researchers, researchers know accordingly a little."</seg>

<seg id="18">"loot make this sharks anyway: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remnants of a Robbe, another had swallowed the pine trees of a young ice cream."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they chase sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for carcasses that are from higher water layers to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were examined 28 Greenland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as examples from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the carbon-14 method of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eylinse arises before the birth of the sharks, which the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a great deal of carbon-14 in the lintel.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s than nuclear-weapon, larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the length of 220 centimeters in the length of the smallest animal, the linsening had suffered a low shot of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it might be celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>

<seg id="29">"that Greenland-females only get replied, if they are longer than four metres, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length were assigned to an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters become probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined, Grönland is obviously obvious at least half a half and a half."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>

<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, an 211 year old Greenland of Greenland, in whose speck at Nack was a 120 year old Harp-tip, was caught up Alaska."</seg>

<seg id="37">"in order to warm up in cold water, the animals are also often particularly large."</seg>

<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, one gets eternally around, at night one is awake in the morning, in the morning it is far before the wake-up cling no longer to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, there is a good company with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of the adults of sleep, and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequent or permanent than not recovered."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many different reasons underlying them, stresses Hans-Günter Weaks, the member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands it among them, but the insomnie, is thus an inhalation and a sleetion."</seg>
<seg id="8">"exactly the sleep many people feel as unsatisfying or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Preancellor of the German Haussman association with practice in the Anglo-Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organs can be organic, mental or loss-related factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the interference expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake-up is often used in a depression," says Weaks. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors are printed.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a Bandshell case, can be bad, wacht every two to three hours and always starts to greet you about everyday problems and -care, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you cope with sleeping disorders for a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who should not sleep well over a period of a month at least three nights per week, and in the day he should go to a doctor, betrayed Weaks."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment may look very different: one is beaten, tired, unexhausted, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has difficulty fluctuations or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate the sleep, it is important to find their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as a treatment options, among other behavioral changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping-coated tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquestion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"rainfant sleeves in Germany can hardly be stressed in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Director of the interdisciplinary dormitory of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, one should consult with sleep problems first to the doctor's doctor."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in case studies can be resolved, if the problems have a physical cause."</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should be in the dormitory, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for the study in the dormitory rates of medicine for example with snoring with respiratory issues, in nursing care, or if you cannot find the cause of a sleeeing."</seg>
<seg id="27">"actually, you do not have to prepare for the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a midday sheep," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">After the chasing you go to bed his normal time.</seg>

<seg id="8">"after on 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police had issued three weeks of official statements according to 30 to 40 officials and three team-cars on site, block parts of the street and held visitors from, the house with the number 94."</seg>

<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>

<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern before increasing rental and grification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound according to an area that congruent police protection against vandalion left.</seg>

<seg id="20">"at the same time, the city district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: with them now they share the inhabitants of the GDR and former house-owned offices."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rental, which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one detects them on warned slices or freshly repainted facades that were beamed with color exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="24">"one reason is that not all neighbours might look at this as a problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury are based almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>

<seg id="31">"therefore, it was also so important that the inhabitants get back their street: from the police, politics and the media, who in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of the inhabitants, like Neugebauer, the road will continue to take away: through reporting new buildings in former buildings that push the old inhabitants."</seg>

<seg id="6">"she sees himself as a contact for all players: refugees, working group refugees, administrations, authorities and who else apart."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the icy wool-mist who above all have a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so some - less spottend, but rather on the variety of desire areas-areas - targeted, as the administration wanted to write the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"searched for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-standing experience in the field of social labor, just an icy wool."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administration is not its central area, suppose Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization working with people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as network value."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent focus on three years of time.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle honors and main actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and constant problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Return to new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"it has been a serious problem for some time, apartments for the joints that have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection of connection the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to put refugees in their own or enlisted dorms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the governor of the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed as very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the management does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it is not so far, one can rely on private apartments, so called Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, non-smoking apartments must be perfected as it is so nice."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed lead, they are traineeship, training courses, training courses, one-euro jobs and the assistance of refugees and migrants that have to be found or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building or help carvers, do non-profit work - and motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop a bearing-being.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, you need special offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So we also jump in managing and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must declare the refugees that it just takes and they can take the time to make sense, for example, with voice curve."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling, he could not help in Urbach, should not work and be useless, that will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, there is also what customers say honestly," people, where nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always motivate to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two after the recent occurrences fear of radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine customer clearly," "what mancher may call" "a Restrisiko could and want to exclude them however."</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitised are the helpers however already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks they bring them completely into action.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with them," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and volunteers must hold out locally and in the region to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always in the background that soon a new Stocks would come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Needs Germany a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">"this issue is clear to answer, apart from politics."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place helpers on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet there, where we want to go", "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, this would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher wrote already in order to incorporate the previous people sensible."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently about 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"however, if people are in need of aid, both women are united."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political situation is so complicated, since there is no simple answers."</seg>
