&quot; at the meeting , it is also possible to tackle the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the ongoing sett@@ ling of Israel and against a Netanyahu @-@ free will in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal which was promoted by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated the relationship between the two . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial talk at the invitation of Republi@@ cans in front of the US Congress , which was valued as an af@@ front against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this agreement with regard to the previous election in Israel . &quot;

&quot; in an emergency , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb with a somewhat thir@@ sty voice of the police , that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; he was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; still live and probably be excited and he said , the family contacts the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; on the house , the officials found the Lei@@ che of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ary and a hand@@ written note that I didn &apos;t do it , I loved it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that represented in two on @-@ line courses for the Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Mississippi , has already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door of his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ v@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ es staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 clock .
he said that he did the fatal emergency tournament sometime later .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when the police c@@ iler him .
&quot; a day after the shooting at the University , the students and faculty to hide , to hide , behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what &apos;s been motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped him to draw an image of an talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
&quot; they said , they were looking forward to their lessons . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ary died , said , he has no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; he himself was mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both subjects in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose textbook were 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to have problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , the Lamb , he said , he also seemed a little excited and nervous as if something is wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lam@@ b told him that he had at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
he had previously asked the Delta State University for a reason for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he taught only two online classes .
&quot; the recent changes in employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for the Lamb had worked so hard for him , no guarantee for an automatic path to an introduction as Assistant professor would represent . &quot;
&quot; Univers@@ alist President William La@@ For@@ ge said he wis@@ er nothing of a conflict between h@@ unter and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot;
they are not able to answer the questions there .
after the flight from the campus the police found later Lam@@ bs trace when he returned to Mississippi from Ark@@ ansas import .
&quot; before he could be arrested , killed himself independently in a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew in the area .
&quot; in 2009 his work at the university , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city started with approximately 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and studied Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he was doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; the lam@@ bs recorded it as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 , when they met by common friends . &quot;
&quot; you and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older boy who tried some years to teach her guitar game . &quot;
he was then the Frau@@ ensch@@ wand .
&quot; all the girls are mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on live . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ary were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency , &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which adjacent to a bass you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ary , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were standing 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; he has never met him . he never met , but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played for blues . &quot;
&quot; he met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail joined three years ago both on a summer festival . &quot;
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ary was a nurse responsible for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sh@@ af@@ fer , a bar@@ ke@@ eper and sometimes entertaining coordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak illumin@@ ating bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic man@@ iel in front of a sp@@ inning audience . &quot;
there was no indication for anything else .
&quot; simply only a lucky couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were on the au@@ sp@@ ine and jo@@ ys with each other .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of mit@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the total professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American native peoples and colonial history , Don Al@@ an Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at the school . &quot;

&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans &apos; added to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that he had shot the emergency , after he was shot by the emergency , and that lam@@ b in his not@@ ary was said to be his wife , but there is no indication that the two were ever married . &quot;

8 Re@@ quired Please note that Donald Tru@@ mp is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to drag Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks of Poll@@ s down , it has not worked ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the final eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in two @-@ dig@@ it range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
neither asser@@ tion that tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that during this period in 2011 , Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Herman C@@ ain , of which no one was given only a state in the nom@@ inations process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but external groups like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth recognize now Tru@@ mp@@ s through@@ put and start to let their dollars flow .
here are some current survey values that suggest that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a tran@@ sit@@ ory phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Beli@@ efs have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tru@@ mp will announced its can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a pol@@ l of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers hold themselves in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa has found last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as a candidates .
&quot; in survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would either be &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if tru@@ mp would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say , they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as the Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say , they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , which would say the same via Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in things enthusi@@ as@@ tically ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters , that they &apos; dis@@ cont@@ ented &apos; or &apos; up@@ set &apos; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would be . &quot;
a majority of Republi@@ cans sees b@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and off@@ end statements , 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans of the Republi@@ cans believe the real temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number counts in the first for@@ oc@@ op@@ al state of the nation , the State of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans thinks that he has the personality for a com@@ mander @-@ in @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , 44 per cent that he will not have the personality to effectively execute justice and say nearly six of 10 oun@@ ces , that his temper@@ ament does not enter into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters acc@@ u@@ ded to the idea .
&quot; when she mo@@ urn to her honour , Republi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
that &apos;s a change since the time when four out of ten took their money to J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters had not in the past the clear@@ est crystal ball .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans covered that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidates &apos; Rom@@ ney . &quot;
nevertheless it appears that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters can be viewed as a plau@@ sible campaign .
&quot; even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around a different candidate , Tru@@ mp be@@ ul almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that the spl@@ itting field probably contributes to the lead , while the Anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is diff@@ used on more than a dozen other candidate . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between Tru@@ mp and the most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp will be harvest . &quot;
&quot; he has passed before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points canopy , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of edge Paul , John Ka@@ uns and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head with Ted Cruz .
the only cont@@ est@@ ant that suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald with the Donald will tell you that they have formed their opinion .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters will support Tru@@ mp , say that they have for@@ given their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much has to happen to change this , and no one can really say , never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said that they are open the door to other candidates .
&quot; nonetheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ si@@ der , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but elec@@ torate that they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp in the theme of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign consisted of two months ago from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tru@@ mp will hold far away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re @-@ oriented endeavour .
&quot; but after the new ABC @-@ Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans , that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp for questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so as long as the immigration lies in the spot@@ light , the Donald Tru@@ mp will seem to do too . &quot;
the frustration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
&quot; by now , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son was out of the support of Republi@@ can voters , primarily through its out@@ si@@ der status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days @-@ pol@@ l of ABC @-@ Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in Io@@ wa 2 weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa @-@ Republi@@ cans on the Republi@@ can in Congress are frustr@@ ated with 54 per cent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive dwell@@ ings in Germany &quot;
&quot; here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg , there is the most expensive residence - with a view over the North sea . &quot;
&quot; in the street , a square meter roof costs approximately 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt is limited to objects of natur@@ als , meaning it is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special noise will cost a square meter most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top locations is one of the price but as Pe@@ anu@@ ts .
the Real Estate @-@ Service Engel &amp; League has released a list of the most exclusive German locations - with square met@@ ric prices in vibr@@ ating high@@ s .

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
bil@@ ing@@ acher ar@@ cher in Pir@@ ates : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happ@@ ier hit by Thomas Müller paved the FC Bayern the way to a th@@ deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ re@@ aus - then ran &apos; s .
a sou@@ ver@@ itable pr@@ el@@ ude of the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have joined the FC Bayern at the Hex@@ enk@@ essel by Piraeus a dream start to the &quot; mission of Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola won their pr@@ el@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek record World Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Twin pack ( 5@@ 2. / 90@@ s + 2 ) and id@@ ols : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ f@@ th debut in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final of May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t after Munich . &quot;
Müller received at his 28th hit in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s guidance of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto which let &apos;s happen as fl@@ ange commemor@@ ate shot of the World Cup .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , had Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis , promised to 31.@@ 6@@ 88 &apos;s hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the estu@@ ary stopped . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated and dedicated presentation , without sh@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had gained his latest six home games in the Royal classification , including against well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , Le@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 proud here Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; however , the Bavaria , had been defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they were cour@@ ageous , but with their offensive efforts , but often to resour@@ c@@ eful efforts are often too resour@@ c@@ eful . &quot;
the attacks was often accompanied by a shift on Link@@ sau@@ ces Douglas Costa from which against the former SPD Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i rarely encountered .
Müller had more luck on the right hand than its fl@@ anks appeared in the upper half @-@ lane in the upper left panel .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Stor@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown adopted the head ball in Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direc@@ ting the go@@ al@@ Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5 ) .
&quot; although the Bavaria were used to put it in the unusual game , Pir@@ ates could ex@@ cre@@ ed needle . &quot;
on go@@ alies Manuel Neu@@ er was Lost .
so about as he took a shot of ide@@ books on the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
&quot; before re , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ ban@@ qu@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the centre near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Götz@@ e , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ res , sat at first outside . &quot;
&quot; the WC @-@ hero was given only after the final training green light , said Sport@@ pre@@ face Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is a mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; at the first change , Guardi@@ ola was decided against him when he brought King@@ sl@@ ey Com@@ an for the tigh@@ tened Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; i@@ dol came up late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller took a seat . &quot;
in front of the game it was in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ alle .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly comp@@ elled Bavaria fans in their audience block apparently , the supporters of hosts Pir@@ ates had prov@@ oked with words and ges@@ tures , attacked the security forces and went with stro@@ kes against the Mün@@ ch@@ ner pend@@ ant . &quot;
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan has been in@@ ju@@ red from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth &quot;
&quot; those who smo@@ kes , thereby not only the lung , but also the teeth - that defines a central long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : the risk is lo@@ wers the risk fast .
smokers have a much higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this is derived from a long @-@ term study of an international research teams , including several associates at the German Institute of Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smoking , the risk to lose pre@@ matur@@ ely , their teeth can lose pre@@ matur@@ ely , in order to catch up to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
&quot; main causes of dental loss , c@@ aries and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , emphasises the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor which emphasize the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore refers to most common g@@ um inflammation in ro@@ bes .
&quot; not clari@@ fied , in@@ wi@@ red smoking also raises the risk for tooth decay . &quot;
&quot; people suffering from smoking might risk their risk but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ard again sin@@ ks at the level of non @-@ smoking , explained Er@@ du@@ de Thomas Diet@@ rich of the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; you need to convince people of this , non @-@ smoking , and the manager H@@ ein Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the life time . &quot;
&quot; not too rough for lung and vessels , and leads according to our findings also toward a good dental health to the high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany more than 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of dental treatment , DI@@ f@@ E shared with . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study em@@ asons the findings .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut in the questions of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns de@@ buted in the questions of the Prime Minister with tension is anticipated
the new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give her debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and made his debut for the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up , in order to prepare the first of his six pre @-@ given questions shortly after lunch , with its performance by the media probably and the Labour MEPs from the proximity . &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
&quot; he also said that he could ski@@ pass some meetings , to leave them to their colleagues . &quot;
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as it comes to his appointment as a member of the shadow of the shadow and his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of the Labour Party took provo@@ king the decision of the Labour Party to be prov@@ oked during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the center of several title pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision , not sing the national hy@@ m@@ n , has attracted attention . &quot;
&quot; one speaker by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , he would have been &quot; &quot; respectful of silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in air sl@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC two News@@ night program , he got to sing the Labour president , the national anth@@ ell@@ ar , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shade @-@ ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns of top workers and they refer to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a guide . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be pushed within &quot; &quot; within Labour &quot; &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns comments on position on the European Union and the limit . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour has set out to remove the whole idea of a limitation total .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pensions , said that the Party &quot; was very clear &quot; be that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is going to be the fifth Labour chair , David Cameron , since he has been the T@@ ory Chief over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour chair , promised a different policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and have given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the questions of the Prime Minister has to be con@@ front@@ ational and that he will refrain from &quot; &quot; damp@@ ness &quot; &quot; and fighting with rub@@ b@@ ness and to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Merkel , the shadow of the Foreign Minister for him , if he is not taking part , for example , when Mr Cameron is on his way abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the building , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became the leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is involved in politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; who is often linked to the questions of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he discovered that he has failed . &quot;
&quot; since she was first sent on TV in 1990 , the ques@@ tioning of the prime minister and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliamentary party , though critics argue that they have become a caric@@ ature and proo@@ fs of vast reforms . &quot;

Met@@ cash will start breaking down soil protection campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - inj@@ ecting
Met@@ cash tries to protect Ig@@ A branch in front of an Al@@ di R@@ ise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a maximum of awareness campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; at Al@@ di the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia passed the beginning of next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing via the social media as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealer and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as Eis@@ Manufactur@@ ers S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distri@@ butes to Ig@@ A @-@ shops samples and shop@@ ke@@ epers that sell tickets for the South Australian football team to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be publishing more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices perform its annual investors strategy . &quot;
&quot; there is much at stake , since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ Laden@@ stein and higher profits as met@@ as @-@ Ig@@ A @-@ network in East @-@ states . &quot;
&quot; shopping in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically the provincial and Ig@@ A retail@@ er feature a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 per cent in the Baltic States . &quot;
&quot; yet , as Morgan Stan@@ ley , believe al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states will take off and all existing players , but mainly independent retailers are taking away . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom Ki@@ er@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retail@@ er 360 $ million sales per year and Met@@ cash will lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will achieve a turnover of 500 million $ and 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and food products and amounts to Met@@ cas@@ hs high fixed cost @-@ based , Met@@ cash could cost roughly 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath said Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Met@@ cash market shares in the East States , mainly at Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ shop@@ ti@@ sts are the most faithful . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley particip@@ ates that Met@@ cas@@ h@@ hs sales in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 and 2.8 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 will reduce earnings by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week told the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business eating in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
Met@@ cash lo@@ wers to respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
&quot; but it is assumed that a pre @-@ board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has been added . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ As &apos;s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent in 2010 , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs &apos;s food and food trading , which is approximately 1.@@ 200 Ig@@ A retail@@ er , has been seen by 43 percent since 2012 , refl@@ ecting its operating pressure on turnover and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler bet , however , and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ to provide sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths , with hundreds of products each week to improve their stores by fast growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private @-@ label food . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the pricing and loading programs are to be st@@ atically and hopes that the big dealer in 2017 will return to a winner in the year 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve Heal@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ cin@@ akis deserves more than praise for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves to view the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve Heal@@ y rather than praise for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger that is known as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; gr@@ ated through the in@@ famous confrontation of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka at the Montreal Masters into the lim@@ elight . &quot;
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rators : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ inka would have to beat K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and I should hit the child .
&quot; while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ acqu@@ et , after a cr@@ amp defended a potential US @-@ Open @-@ victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was res@@ is@@ hable by Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the te@@ ens is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth to the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup @-@ semi@@ finals towards the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I was rather rich , is the fact that after my opinion th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little in the dispute , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et , when he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ack@@ et from Fr@@ ust with itself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has acted in the US Open extremely well , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison , and so on , and I think he earned a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around you , and I believe that he was treated a little . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he adap@@ ts into the team and so on , he has never seen a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe it deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision , K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os not to take into account the important decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; as the right one for all , but he saves the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to come back as a long @-@ term permanent part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the contro@@ versy round &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Nick was very quickly made to Ascension , where people like Feder@@ er and Murray has been advised , and he deserves all the cri@@ tic that he gets , but we try to explain it , and it is best for the team , and it is best for the team , and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency rule and exclu@@ des the border holding refugees
&quot; Hungary explained the emergency and turned the south @-@ border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the firm , who tried to escape illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed the border , as hundreds of migrants gathered themselves in another , and Serbian officials with indi@@ gn@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the people who were flo@@ wn before violence , for an unknown period in a landing on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries , and built tents , and settled down there . &quot;

some are taken from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Ministers declared it is &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
&quot; ( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a collective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the coming days talks will have to take place in Brussels and other countries &quot; I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the tur@@ mo@@ il in the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ Block with a str@@ ative meeting in Brussels to make no common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were in shr@@ inking Italy and Greece refuge . they op@@ ted their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU states would have more 120,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration of the continent .
&quot; Hung@@ arians , however , did not put his hopes on an Balearic promotion in Brussels or from its neigh@@ bor . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , not@@ ted emergency in two southern regions , authorities gave more powers to cope with the crisis , so they could dismis@@ s roads and asylum proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country would also plan to build a thorn @-@ wi@@ red along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country , after ending a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons leave in the race to create bar@@ bed wire from Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in the past few months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ ders from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and for the entry point into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic migrants are looking for a better life , and not war tw@@ ins that are entitled to protection - a view which strongly contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws passed around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meters ( 13 feet ) tall fence , to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws are also set higher arrest on human dealers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs re@@ por@@ ters in the Southern city Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree with the engagement of the military in the wake of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ por@@ ter from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen at the border with heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities take 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
they come across to damage the fence and they are now in police go@@ dly and will acc@@ use the opening of crimes in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are to rep@@ airing the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials joined the Tuesday morning also two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed @-@ wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos transformed the most important border crossing into Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and thr@@ ust myself into a crowd . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to come up , but thousands were outside . &quot;
&quot; another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water , until they may travel to Hungary . &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons in front of Bern@@ ie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
&quot; the former Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a two @-@ dig@@ it jump in democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but sen@@ ator Bern@@ ie S@@ anders gets her towards the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , by 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed whether he will receive the presidential system , supported by 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion matters , what candidates they will support . &quot;
&quot; however , Clin@@ tons of supporters are more permanent than those of the other candidates in their election . &quot;
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost in a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders had gained some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a major lead in women and temper@@ ates , but these prec@@ ays are reduced . &quot;
&quot; your support in the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons of advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has c@@ urs@@ ed , and they are now on the same height . &quot;
but Clinton has a major lead in older voters .
&quot; last month , Clinton was with two double @-@ dig@@ it lead in liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead to this group . &quot;
&quot; for example , half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections will say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;
a quarter would support them with some advantages and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly impressed by her .
the views are more mixed with those who are currently not supporting you - only about one quarter would support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the elections are saying that they should support Clinton with enthusiasm , say fewer Republi@@ can voters dies about its peak @-@ style Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ tons of supporters can be asked in an open question , why they want the candidate to be the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman President is President ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) . &quot;
Clin@@ tons of Clin@@ ics is also mentioned in conjunction with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and voters are also c@@ ited .
&quot; since the Vice President sets out a potential for the presidential system to the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections will see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters of the elections are asked , who for the party were their second choice , Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; by Clin@@ tons followers , more than half , that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; decides to run Bi@@ den , not for the nom@@ ination of democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clinton is stepped in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without it in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; be@@ den is by far a second with this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ est &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important to a candidate , Democratic voters have questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate to the voters of the presidential elections as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results with constitu@@ ents of the elections of their party .
&quot; ambig@@ ui@@ ties , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and furnished with strong leadership . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds cuts the best in the three candidates most closely with honesty , while exercising power is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; in general , democratic voters of the presidential elections also call Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all of these measurements , some one quarter of the democratic voters has no idea of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton to continue to address a personal email address and a server during the term as Secretary of Secretary , most Democratic voters of the presidential elections are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; under their explanation , half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion about this was in March , just after the issue of light was split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deterior@@ ated worse . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; even though Clinton is seen by the voters of their party as being honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under a registered elec@@ torate : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of equal rights do not hold her for a honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time 55 percent of the entitled to vote is also Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp are good notes at leadership .
&quot; cut candidates from the six tried , Car@@ son and Bush on the best in honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority is seen rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic constitu@@ ents under the presidential election shall be 6 percent@@ ages . &quot;
Ben Car@@ son starts with a survey near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; in the meantime , half of the voters gave the voters in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large number . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted in the last month ago , by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son was in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received at demo@@ graphic groups and may sur@@ ges tru@@ mp under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio &apos;s Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ uns , is struck out by the Wis@@ con@@ ner Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , which has fallen down by 10 % assistance in the last month to now 2 % . &quot;
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush ; the former governor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are on the third place .
the trou@@ bles@@ hooting at the sampling of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which has been published last week shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - he enjoys at 19 % support in the republi@@ cans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tru@@ mp clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at one of the last week of rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp was found some side effects for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised to put Tru@@ mp@@ s faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp on the past Saturday during a campaigns at Io@@ wa . &quot;

five members of the Br@@ otherhood uses the death of a bar@@ b College @-@ Neul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student during a mur@@ der@@ ous ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , are filed for five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York City &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood , attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introduc@@ tory period in September 2013 and consumed his transportation to the hospital , which has contributed to his death to the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been charged with the associated eyes with a 30 @-@ pound ru@@ cks@@ ack with sand , and repeatedly has been attacked while trying to head over a frozen field . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally mo@@ ur@@ ned over head@@ ache , then it was unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood does not irrit@@ ate the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g impot@@ ent was made and waited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms of goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Br@@ otherhood , to contact Council , said police officer Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide and put the welfare of the Br@@ otherhood basically about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ cies Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; after an auto@@ graph report , Den@@ g reiter@@ ated with st@@ ump@@ ins power injury to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the chic@@ ks of Br@@ otherhood . at least a student dies for 1970 every year , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s Family , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indic@@ t@@ ment due to the mur@@ derer of the Third Gr@@ ades for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ thirty members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with fatal attacks and the formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - this has promp@@ ted this to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College was forbidden , and the Br@@ otherhood has forbidden , and the national br@@ otherhood has re@@ vo@@ ke its membership to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; zinc in@@ ca@@ vities are coming , and the house will turn into the heat , returns for bonds , and the economy is gli@@ de into a recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it all last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only little guide to the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve on lifting the interest rates is often , though not always , a factor thereby , such as the economy and financial investments . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. central bank have consistently argu@@ ed that investors cannot focus on how it starts to increase the interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
in the end market participants could notice that the whole excitement of a Zin@@ ovi@@ position may possibly be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ it@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of the &quot; endor@@ sement of &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Economics at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we expect not to expect the gradual return of the U.S. interest on normal heights , but still on the lowest level to be to the sei@@ sm@@ ic shock that seem to fear a lot . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no re@@ percus@@ sions . &quot;
here is one of the historical trends @-@ based focus on how some areas of business might react :
as seen in the last month the anticip@@ ation of Zin@@ no@@ ca@@ vities can make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ le .
&quot; once the increase comes , the influence is not as dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth assets 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be arous@@ ed , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank &apos;s analy@@ st in a newer study on what has happened to Zin@@ ser@@ ca@@ vities . &quot;
&quot; specifically , the market in the past 35 years is most likely in the last 35 years ( average profit of 2.8 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14,@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , Chief Executive Committee with Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares must rise later in the c@@ et@@ ation cycle and the return starts to decrease .
Rez@@ es@@ thouses are a fact of economic life but interest rates promote it often .
in the current case the F@@ ed faced with some conditions that could not exist before and that a recession could accelerate .
&quot; extremely remarkable is here , that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in a lot@@ tery of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , in 1950 it had only twice the nominal volume of GDP under 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect the third quarter to receive F@@ ed only 1,5 percent . &quot;
&quot; interest in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and throwing the question , &quot; &quot; if this time is different &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
market participants have made all year round a revers@@ al of the F@@ ed and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday .
&quot; while many shr@@ ines and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could increase an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade is only a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all increases @-@ cycles from 1950 to now have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum when GDP had been taken place and on @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ eh@@ en very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shade , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and this is now 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the fixed income was vol@@ ati@@ le , since the market takes a concentration of measures , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect at bonds is faster than for shares , if it change its strategic target . &quot;
&quot; at bonds , the returns to change the direction once the first increase / lowering in the cycle occurs . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the c@@ et@@ ting cycle , the bond rating falls right away , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the shr@@ ink of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will result in that , coming up between longer and shorter journeys to move closer and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ uation of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ rate bonds often bring better y@@ ields in such a climate although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ stin from Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to more strict monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the income curve is increased and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has increased - all features of the market , if the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy . &quot;
&quot; large and whole , companies which benefit the greater part of their business operations in the USA , benefit from interest rates , and local products are more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts will be worse off as an increasing dollar off their products on the global market is more expensive and just financing their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality - &quot; stocks tend to respond extremely positively , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s in a report for the customers . &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded all companies in 1994 and 2004 in response to each of the interests of interest in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average by 5 percentage points . &quot;
&quot; company with high capital expenditure , as well as low vol@@ ati@@ lity in its shares also met their counter@@ parts with low quality at average 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) . &quot;
debts will become a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are to lose most , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure stock exchange , consumers will also benefit through the increasing dollars . &quot;
&quot; it could see profits from higher y@@ ields , even if experts are of different opinion , how fast it will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament member Andrew Bin@@ gham
&quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the radio because of its &quot; &quot; sc@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished by commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted on the BBC Music Awards and told that only the B@@ its im@@ i@@ presented
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins pointed the broadcast The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; turns up &quot; to Classic FM , which maintains a leading parliamentary member and increases new pressure on the sender , to prove that he does not do something that the private sender doesn &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives MP Andrew Bin@@ gham was also told the BBC bos@@ ses , that the publicly @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ as &quot; fool@@ ish &quot; and increasingly do not differ from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I do not use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it appears to transform Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was also quoted on the BBC Music Awards held last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , the Br@@ its appear only under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr Bin@@ gham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General , pointed the boards back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 has a long way ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and intelligence . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 l@@ erne , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and to give the engagement of Radio 3 , new music and to give new works to order , I consider to be really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that tough@@ er works to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less about classical music . &quot;
&quot; but Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC @-@ production , which performed during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for it under fire to tre@@ ad the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory members of Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins pointed The Voice - the musical talent show of BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producers of Tal@@ pa Media for the estimated cost of 22 million . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall was insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - made with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; dedicated to special BBC broadcast .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our home @-@ house stable &quot; , &quot; when it was the next time a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of other rows of The Voice in the Future , or to spend money in the mix@@ er for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sur@@ geons will end in August at the slo@@ west and the Black Friday may be responsible for it
seven percent increase in online sales in the first three months of 2015 .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by the use of phones to shop
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slo@@ wed down on Friday in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shop has dri@@ lled , and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into vul@@ ster@@ cities . &quot;
&quot; yet , experts say that there are now signs that the line sales stagn@@ ant after new figures were only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure on August has been presented as the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with just five percent increase from the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that online sales will be stag@@ gered according to new figures for only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , then that has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ selling of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales rose up three years ago , as a purch@@ aser , with their hands @-@ made purchases . &quot;
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments such as at home on the sofa .
&quot; but now comm@@ utes this one , and we may possibly experience that growth is dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is being quoted as a reason for subsequent revenues . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers have their bought this event , which each takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , five times the average number of buyers to do their computers , to make their bar@@ gain and some dealers turned off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyer could be fought for bar@@ gain , buyers from what could be done . &quot;
&quot; a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium took out that 5 £ , spending a little over 1 £ . &quot;
&quot; for some products such as television and wash@@ ers , more than one third of the purchases are carried out via web @-@ shops . &quot;
at the same time more than one quarter of the people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the col@@ d@@ chains .

&quot; an Arabic version of Dek@@ rets , which was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the leadership of the company will travel abroad . &quot;

at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales places inland
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , city boss @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
&quot; it is argu@@ ed that British settle its h@@ amm@@ ers and brus@@ hes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the works in their home , &quot;
&quot; if you were sent with a hammer or a brus@@ hes for the cont@@ agi@@ ous from walls , you seem to be part of a minority today . &quot;
&quot; the British are increasingly occupied craftsmen in order to do hom@@ ein@@ izing jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Véronique Lau@@ ry , who owns new chair@@ men of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craft@@ sman from Eastern Europe , the services offered at sea prices may be out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; we therefore plans King@@ fis@@ her , 200 further scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are directed to arti@@ sans and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the shop are met by women . &quot;
&quot; now , at the moment the men prevail over the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it is necessary to place the increasing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; I still works a majority of men in our stores .
we have to move this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients consisting of 80 percent of the decision on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in the decision making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry who is one of only five women listed on the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index @-@ listed companies , has also re@@ arranged their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial status . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is here an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Super@@ visory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her mel@@ ted a decline in the semi @-@ year profit and the ou@@ tre@@ aches after the group put the costs for the closing of the shops .
&quot; due to the trends King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity
at the State Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt have already got two function@@ aries of the Austrian volley@@ ball vic@@ tor A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and rec@@ ital affairs .
the accused are not guilty .
one of them was also charged with ambition .
&quot; of this accus@@ ation , he was acqu@@ itted on in May of legally . &quot;
the current process has been h@@ unted .
&quot; according to the Robert Ri@@ ffel competence , Robert Ri@@ ffel had alli@@ ed out into pre @-@ investigations that the def@@ endants were allowed in 2006 to 2011 funds of aims to use them for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage was measured with approximately 400,000 Euros . &quot;
the Sport @-@ Func@@ tion@@ ists are also charged with regard to financial costs .
&quot; this was divided by the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ el@@ sen@@ ats , Rich@@ ess Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the accus@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense represents that the association was created at no time an asset . &quot;
&quot; the spor@@ tsmen had only had performances and the Sport@@ club , for whom they had been working from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , the Passi@@ va sh@@ ines in 2001 about 600,000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we continue to hold the club or block the club , &quot; one of the accused , in the bread@@ tory of the financial officer . &quot;
he decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all the risks .
&quot; we have prescribed money , our life insurance as a safety when entering the bank , &quot; he said with the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money free , there is only no debt made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , - in the proportionate financial crisis , the payout of the che@@ unc@@ ements has been adopted , from 1991 to 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the performances would have only been paid years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus has been on the account . &quot;
&quot; so the ra@@ ils were also pri@@ chal@@ - and not Detail@@ view , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and austerity administration sought the two accused , said the second accused . &quot;
why the exp@@ ires of the association was not detailed in detail how the judge asked .
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial stability , if only the debt of debt has been , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; when in 2011 against the official test intended for am@@ ass@@ ing abuse , an amount of 120,000 Euro was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; that may have been appropri@@ ations , the accused . &quot;
&quot; this paper , which was referred to in the name of the second accused and was not known as according to the statement of the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
&quot; so , the respon@@ dent did not know a response for a long time . &quot;
&quot; then he said , finally , he believed that this is the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor presented to the room . &quot;
&quot; the def@@ endant has been notified , prior to the officials . &quot;
this transfer has been formulated as in@@ dem@@ nity .
why cont@@ amin@@ ants wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
&quot; the first accused , who did not agree with this phrase , because the association has never caused a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the attorney says , &quot; &quot; With whom you are all off the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the officials said he has never taken a cent content , which he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; in di@@ ets which he charged the Club 1000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure would have been much higher , he added . &quot;
accurate documents for the early years enabled the accused .
&quot; these are according to a business test , in which everything was judged correctly , no longer preserved , they explained . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ es also had the second accused did .
&quot; all containers can be made in cash , in addition , they have to drive from his place of international humanitarian market to the Bank , stated in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard Power@@ ful more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the recruitment process for three years , the computer temp@@ ts is to build more jobs during the spl@@ itting of the company . &quot;
the Vac@@ an@@ cies at the US @-@ Compu@@ Bl@@ esen Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) is not an end .
&quot; the US technology sector is planning to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate clients in the framework of its restructuring . &quot;
&quot; in this way , costs are to be saved in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.@@ 4 billion euros ) , the company distributed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special exposure of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will drop down from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed for three years now . &quot;
&quot; HP employees at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , still around 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
maintain the Hewlett @-@ Packard announces 2.3 % after .
the newly built corporate group of the C@@ alifor@@ ni@@ an Pal@@ o Alto is currently focused on : this is how the computer and printing business are bund@@ led in a new society - separate from the need for computer servers and data store for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be noted on the stock market .
&quot; once again , a once again dis@@ continued PC @-@ paragraph , as well as a weaker demand of corporate clients , after its services the second largest PC @-@ manufacturer has finally placed after Len@@ ovo . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter late July the sales of the PC and printers rose by 11.@@ 5 % in the third quarter . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to around 25.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; thus , the proceeds were back in 15 of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP answers a spl@@ itting up and massive vac@@ an@@ cies on the changes in the industry .
the 76 years old company under the direction of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only re@@ acted to the fact that customers are buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more shops immediately online .
&quot; Whit@@ mans restruc@@ tur@@ plans will see a total reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the US market
&quot; the world ob@@ serves if the U.S. is gathered for two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for nearly a decade , interest rates are to be lifted up or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed is going to be a little longer , and the interest rates of the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent will keep . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach one situation where a large central bank is likely to leave the zero @-@ sector and starts a process of norm@@ alising the interest rates , &quot; said Martin U@@ bi@@ des , Leit@@ giving employees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ llion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate just a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less thin view of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; she has war@@ ned the markets to set itself on an increase , but the signs indicate that chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is scheduled to be published at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
overcoming the Delta State University ob@@ struc@@ ting ap@@ ologies
&quot; after the shooting , and kill his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later finished his colleague his colleague , Sh@@ annon Lamb a note to say that he is &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could not happen &quot; , &quot; the authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that represented , lectur@@ er for geography and socio @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number towards 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , he had shot on someone and killed him . &quot;
represented by the staff of the emergency centre that police police officers must send to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I enjoyed my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; in the house , but &quot; &quot; no one is disturbing , &quot; &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller according to his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
he did not give an explanation for his shots .
&quot; as the police demanded the scene , she found the body of Amy Pr@@ ab@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to do it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note he drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he ended E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen clim@@ bed him . &quot;
&quot; Univers@@ alist President William La@@ For@@ ge said he wis@@ er nothing of a conflict between h@@ unter and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that pr@@ enti@@ ary also had a relationship , said officials on Tuesday , there &quot; do not give any information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relation . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were about seven years and were described as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were trained 15 years ago , but were friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ary have had a daughter who is 19 and she was destroyed in the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online at home , according to the statement from Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of pre@@ table . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that &quot; &quot; Pr@@ un@@ ss &quot; &quot; who poss@@ essed a dog named Light@@ ning , for about three years with Lamb . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , represented relatives at a certain point on Monday to say to them , &quot; he goes not into prison . &quot;
&quot; as a polic@@ eman took him on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on this night , he drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the woods and crew themselves with a shot . &quot;
he obtained in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University to make a PH@@ D as its Li@@ k@@ le to the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa planning a large group building .
&quot; a half billion euros a year wants to save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization . &quot;
150 of the world around 1000 executives will cost the workplace management at the workplace .
with the pilot plant there is in@@ tim@@ ately new negotiations .
the Lufthansa builds its Business Struc@@ ture and adds value to the approval @-@ based Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ign@@ ment is a contribution of about EUR 500 million per year from cost and solution @-@ to @-@ syner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a member of the board at Lufthansa more for the passenger . &quot;
the Bil@@ o@@ flu@@ i@@ ie Euro@@ wings are designed as independent as possible .
&quot; in the leadership team , Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible in the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ wings in the future . &quot;
&quot; with the re @-@ setting , the sp@@ oh@@ r highlights the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group will continue to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet . &quot;
&quot; up to date , the organisation of the 120 000 employees has become strong and complex . &quot;
&quot; the river @-@ lines are under the roof of the passage airline , which represents the three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion . &quot;

cock@@ pit wants to come back into a year with a progn@@ os@@ ti@@ zed recru@@ iting scheme &quot; as fast as possible .
the conflict between union and air @-@ line conducted several strikes in the past few months .
&quot; background is besides the transi@@ tional supply of the pil@@ ots , the austerity concept &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play monthly
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
&quot; while this entry into the top def@@ ender to the wines and exclu@@ de him for at least six months of games , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope to hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was transferred to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has double points of leg , and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will then moved on tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then played fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had a oxygen mas@@ ke .
he cri@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have double score , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Moreno appeared to be happy to be a Red Card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter !
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ rators had to be mist@@ aken .
&quot; they can judge for themselves , when I say that an el@@ meter and a red card was charged . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a T@@ we@@ et to Sha@@ ws account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more back . &quot;
directed to : Manchester United inherited the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at defeat at the PS@@ V
the England @-@ Def@@ enders has an additional incentive in France to recover up to the coming June .
&quot; Philli@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury the place are all very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an enemy .
&quot; Moreno suffered a mis@@ er@@ ation , as Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Championship 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he does very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it is a very horrible injury , this is not good , &quot; said C@@ oc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , who was in a different direction , so it looked like he was touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad there . I am sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought into hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ game of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax is better ?
&quot; it is a thing that all parents soon learn : when your child loves a book , it will not take long before you get it almost there . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child book was asked , decided the prime minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 @-@ tested environment @-@ based label of Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , he writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always an image or a message which we have missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron describes the plot of book , instead a ingredient of the film version of 2012 reg@@ ains that added new characters and details to add the pretty short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , hopes to win a boy named Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , reads a real tree , whose proper name The@@ odor Se@@ uss was sil@@ vered and the 1991 died , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this is not yet suspic@@ ious enough , it will be presented by Cameron presented and partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie which is presented on the web site of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he manages to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely to be familiar to Cameron the action of the book so little familiar . here &apos;s an un@@ used boy , like the local environment by the big gre@@ ed , trees , Th@@ need to stri@@ cken beings , &quot; which talks on behalf of the trees &quot; , &quot; devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax has not read for 20 consecutive time after a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text was probably met by Camer@@ ons .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was supplied by Camer@@ ons employees , but did not have any further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England but it is still hard
&quot; to reach Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you have chosen the cad@@ res that England is chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series was not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de an aw@@ ay@@ ation .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page is probably less experienced as the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ player in the Batt@@ ing Up , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not carry s@@ cars from 2012 , only a y@@ outh@@ ful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as a spin@@ dle and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; in this message @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th schei@@ d from the UK @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th goes out of course for me as his boss , Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze . &quot;
&quot; among its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ book are oriented on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark of Joe Roo@@ t , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said this before - players make their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago it would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully strikes further lungs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes out . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not give such good performances , and this is not surprising me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test head@@ mark comes to put his character , is difficult . &quot;
Ly@@ th has got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ ton did get the chance to do it home and forward @-@ looking .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that can be up , was that England first sat down in the Caribbean - as a Ly@@ th was in peak , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a shock that I highly value .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ m@@ ess player , what we saw during Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he achieved 236 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; it must obtain at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends of course on the team setting in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would bring a extra @-@ spin@@ ster and four qu@@ icks would be de@@ af , and I have nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a stroke will not strike there , and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious player by cri@@ cket player . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een did not have done his job for his County Wor@@ ces@@ ter@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my past team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 test in the first drop before he joined in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he has managed to immediately three hundred R@@ uns and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited relationship with it he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their stat@@ s on an average of 31 with the bat , and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that can lift their hands and the coaches have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the crew , England has made a few clever additions to the train@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Carolina awar@@ t , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as consultants for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest people of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the Tour and brings energy and a powerful work to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as Coach , and such as Mah@@ ela has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;

some will not agree but Co@@ aches and team actors do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players will depend on their jobs on the results .
such decisions are not made easy heart .
the Bre@@ xit camp ( Bre@@ xit = stop Britain from the EU ) could gain an allowance if the economy takes place in 2017 through a flush .
&quot; David Camer@@ ons un@@ balanced new ex@@ si@@ veness strategy to keep Britain in the EU , even without the choice of the ingeni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who were falling apart from Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at team , told recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angl@@ ed into various crises , as the EU is now and not always from own fault , Britain itself , posed an@@ ed agenda with soci@@ alized mar@@ riages and disturbing contracts , which they mostly do not want to be filled . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual general meeting , that it does not like it , if they thre@@ aten the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance , climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they will win associations for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes one to the outside Britain in the interior of the EU Zel@@ tes - &apos; let us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials came to the point where we stick to it , whether we remain or going . &quot;
&quot; German ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an association , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office , before it looks bad for her , as it did at the exagger@@ ated long ex@@ hil@@ ation such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or its inc@@ ub@@ ation in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ ending force .
&quot; Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left wing . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will t@@ ear@@ ring a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British to prevent their energy better for it , Scotland &apos;s resign@@ ation from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there may even plan some such ministers even un@@ mistak@@ able comments , entirely at the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ en@@ dum@@ pl@@ es@@ li , in order to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , he thought my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt , and &quot; Great Britain has won anything of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how r@@ busin@@ ess@@ ly the Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense and which EU Sk@@ ep@@ ites the oligar@@ chy is , as she did during the Tony Ben@@ n inspired referendum in 1975 but did not , which supported our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak in Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ opportun@@ ists who took a name for themselves as an &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Just ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; in Brussels and correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his resign@@ ation , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; to this it belonged to the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing jack@@ ets , telephone h@@ ack@@ end foreigners and the pseudo non @-@ Indian states that have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air didn &apos;t really think about her , but set it when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage to distr@@ act better ban@@ anas in order to distr@@ act him instead of going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air itself , when he ref@@ uted Camer@@ ons refer@@ en@@ du@@ cts , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle behind the adopted Constitution of the EU , which then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 to open it a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never denied it .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me on Monday in Westminster , a friendly l@@ apse on her back - I told him that he had no more time for me to waste as a danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ but strategy of the 80 &apos;s years to repeat , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but it must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media but not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , his BBC @-@ sofa . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe is - I sometimes express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ant tendency and the wil@@ lows of tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness you can say yes everyone to say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is that which Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ ns was an appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a law firm . &quot;
&quot; reminded me of the 70 @-@ he years , as his old father to his old father to his efforts , to be loyal to his Labour cabinet , without going to go far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle has been more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expressed - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , neither what J@@ C said to his collabor@@ ators and members according to all reports on their proceedings on the eve . &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n will tell you - remember that he even stir@@ red up - news discipline remains essential in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of Social Media , a breeding @-@ care centre of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s true to give Cameron any free card for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ ation campaign for a given course , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it stated . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think certainly .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ uous ties for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ ain economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past , is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C has no campaign for out@@ let , foreign diplom@@ ats will be inde@@ b@@ ted to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin get political capital , they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , which was remin@@ is@@ cent of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report from Public Health England via E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes was less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with ties to tobacco industry . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et also joined by cri@@ tici@@ ze the evidence of public health England ( p@@ hic ) in their report of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
p@@ he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; yet , some researchers have questioned the res@@ ili@@ ence of the data and transferred to the connections between several experts and tobacco industry . &quot;
a editorial written in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; exceptionally win@@ dy base &quot; on the p@@ he his most important conclusion .
&quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J , and have asked whether the alleg@@ ations &quot; build &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Immun@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the assessment of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is approximately 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi@@ specialist criteria . multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis -@@ MC@@ DA ) to produce their opinions about the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products , the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell , said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO previously received from British American Tob@@ acco Monitoring ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to publicity health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing he ought to have received after reports prior to the Tab@@ ak@@ company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not delivered , but include several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also supply a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in the table control .
at the meeting also the tobacco leadership took part from p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; lo@@ wered &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages caused by most products by most criteria , &quot; concluded Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell told that the alleg@@ ations of p@@ he that &quot; there is so far no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes was used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that I have been responding to the claims by BM@@ J previously . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking .
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence is close , that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes can be low compared to that , but we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence of evidence and what is not , especially when there are so much public confusion about related dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die yearly at a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion euros per year . &quot;
&quot; due to clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC was supposed to give West En@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should cease to send programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice for commercial ri@@ vals &quot; for hit shows as the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio @-@ charge should only be used to make the type of programs that will not be sent by other UK radio stations .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC for that they have publicly seen public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard contro@@ versy over the most popular gigs of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ Direc@@ torate , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , with the BBC to come into contact . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC &apos;s programmes were commissioned or sends , which clearly indicated by not sub@@ ven@@ tion@@ ated ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation about the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the sightseeing fee , what I don &apos;t like to make mid or long term not for a good idea , one should at least take up its production at least on programs that do not do or order . &quot;
&quot; they send the Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to achieve a broad support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this , is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it is of course nonsense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm to it . &quot;
&quot; I am trying to see myself , how it should be public @-@ legal TV . &quot;
I don &apos;t believe that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a busin@@ es@@ sman for series , Channel 4 , 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC really blame for the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC give the again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ op@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows to sell as East@@ er@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law N@@ ic programs go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , however , where one can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfil their duties , and they may argue that they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
&quot; they put them into a window @-@ window , in which no one wanted to see them ever . &quot;
&quot; on the radio station , Johnson said the board : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can obtain the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of us think that one receives a great value for 150 £ each year , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 £ , I wonder whether this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called that BBC to review its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to provide and to enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little by BBC @-@ production would now be classi@@ cally classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example to the public @-@ legal TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , by which he said that only a handful of television is shown to make online available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ hal@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound@@ waves
&quot; the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ ography can change the direction in the moment , in which they will be pun@@ ished with Klang@@ impul@@ ses . &quot;
scientists have been bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified ne@@ at@@ systems which can be controlled by er@@ up@@ tions of sound @-@ waves .
&quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction during the moment in which they have with sound impul@@ ses , which have for human ear too high frequencies , to be heard of being pun@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; the impul@@ ses are set by switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to wear the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ aso@@ und waves . &quot;
further leads to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , where ultr@@ aso@@ und can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of the depths of people to treatment the symptoms of Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; F@@ igar@@ ettes is usually not responding to ultr@@ aso@@ und , but chal@@ as@@ ani turned out that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , reinforce the ultr@@ aso@@ und @-@ waves that move into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultr@@ aso@@ und waves act at structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and be found in the membrane of some of the wor@@ ms .
&quot; the sound waves form the opening of these I@@ on channels and activate the cells that they are assigned , so a report Nature Communications . &quot;
to create ultr@@ aso@@ und @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des that changed Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry .
&quot; when he uses ultr@@ aso@@ und to the altered creatures , the mu@@ c@@ rests are reinforced by the micro @-@ rays and into the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetic tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool , enabling scientists to re @-@ switch ( neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses from light ) and turn on . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ hal@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , that has to be sent to the desired body in the brain in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ aso@@ und tissue can happen and can be sent into the brain at the top of the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with Gen@@ o@@ therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the assimil@@ ated human neur@@ ons temporarily to make the ultr@@ aso@@ und signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insul@@ in @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student dormit@@ ories
&quot; eleven years ago , I moved as self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense sm@@ iles of those I have angry - and to the numerous , long @-@ heart@@ ed complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the suit in student dormit@@ ory ranges from light nerve wre@@ cking up to absolutely sho@@ cking .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , where and where you &apos;ve lost Sabbath @-@ Year , where you &apos;re in regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in Ernst , guys , it is only a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - place your questions and show interest .
it orchestr@@ ates the conversation and helps you discover the people that you like being in contrast to those with which you would not speak even if your eyelashes were gr@@ ated in fire and that fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people .
&quot; people often turn into soft @-@ recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear themselves and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; in case of reference , do not remember the university with a relationship &quot;
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted will receive a cru@@ de treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , but many students form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ um@@ mel @-@ culture that can be friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be hell for someone , who is temp@@ ted to recover . &quot;
&quot; nothing in the culture permits you to say : &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship go forth , but you have to go away , that I get the energy back I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a composite milit@@ ant is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send it to him a SMS .
hi@@ pro@@ pos . do not do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by b@@ aking .
&quot; since you start the university on the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the monastery is present in the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of browsers , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &apos; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to give you . so , and now please note , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offer home @-@ made goodies is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself and will subsequently associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends if you are a decent bakery . &quot;
bad missing l@@ ump of fl@@ our , sugar and fat lead to it that people ask for sleeping when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ al food is a common crime in students .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft but is it the Take of a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the dairy property .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to self use , even if bo@@ il in the inside . &quot;
&quot; when someone conc@@ eal your stuff is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it as my ro@@ ommate who added to her milk a dishwasher to pun@@ ish di@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make noise the people leave from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent man , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people who sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hallway asked her neighbours if it turns them something out , Drum &amp; Bass is a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted with even more older music .
&quot; when they finally heard at 5 p.m. , they left their neighbours for two hours before they left their own music , shut their door shut down and went off to their three @-@ hour test . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would move random@@ ly in the same dor@@ m ?
&quot; the other way around , it would not be dis@@ ground@@ ed if you need a ro@@ ommate for your future partner who wants to separate themselves and then experience them every day , and maybe experience how they bring together all our common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own ways - but when a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your shelter . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has its key in his not having placed room , is the border between a Ul@@ k and har@@ ass@@ ment as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good strike is fun , but it only takes moments , until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; give away a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety , but you never miss someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ amp@@ oo . &quot;
&quot; shut your door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the free@@ zer - but get their pos@@ sessions at the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;

thousands of refugees will push for the living market
the ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes in knowing how quickly a living room can be created : he builds in a project town@@ houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner : many refugees will push for the living market as a whole .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass @-@ making accommodation in containers or turn@@ around have no sustainability .
for the people remain a big part here .
&quot; in the light of the refugee @-@ current , we also require a sufficient housing in the next decades . &quot;
&quot; a quite ban@@ ales , thre@@ ef@@ old town house is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town house needs the least room .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when you under@@ mine the people of residence blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently built in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can easily be changed according to the specific needs . &quot;
how much is the cost ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is at 184 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple upgrade is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings App , click &quot; gener@@ a &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
some are ste@@ ered after the installation on problems as they obtain an error message that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
&quot; to avoid the issue , users will be advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may possibly mean the delet@@ ing of apps to create place - but Apple has made it more likely to do with the release of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you need a special tool to reset it and then re @-@ install it once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth remember@@ ing that your mobile phone is loaded throughout the update or is located near a char@@ ger , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update will continue , since the phone might be switched on half @-@ way and this could lead to a break@@ up of the updates . &quot;

Dr Frank Müller takes over practices Fel@@ lowship ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice by Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
there are also a lot of Zambia Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ists in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
in many places in the country physicians - A@@ sen@@ dorf don &apos;t have any luck : there will be Dr Frank Müller on 1 October the practice Fel@@ lowship ausen .
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship enters into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing on its successor to the side in the next months . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ building phase Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; there was sympathy with regard to the first sight when the fel@@ lowship has met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently met her professional styles at the Institute &apos;s Hospital and wants to get into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was , I was simply ph@@ oned . &quot;
&quot; couple Müller took the idea to continue to operate our own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf , in the future . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families about the years , &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he will soon see his own boss . &quot;
and so one was agreed that the gar@@ bage bought the house with the practice .
they will be able to live in br@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also raised , his medicine studies in Hannover followed stations in several doctors &quot; offices and to hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
he was active as a doctor in Sul@@ ingen and in 2009 he was appointed a surgeon to the district Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is committed to volunteers in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of resistance .
from September 19 the practice for the new boss is prepared .
throughout the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ lowship has worked as a surgeon . his spouse has specialised in the neuro@@ lo@@ gi@@ sts .
&quot; the gar@@ bage dump , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle for themselves as pet . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the re@@ modeling the rooms will be modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ aso@@ und exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and exposure EK@@ GS and need a speaking room more .
&quot; furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 Euro get the gar@@ bage dump within the framework of a funding programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) , as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; that shows how proud and happy we are that the practice continues to be continued , &quot; &quot; stresses the sam@@ t@@ down champion Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , approximately 2000 patients come into practice Fel@@ lowship breaks , in the north @-@ German average practice , approximately 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another building office .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no replacement had found , they would have gone . &quot;
&quot; if the gar@@ bage Consult@@ ation was attended , is by the way also still looking into familiar faces : takes over the seven medical practi@@ tioners and the cleansing from the fields . &quot;
&quot; with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf a era , after all the medical lives have been practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; rec@@ alls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen sh@@ ank . &quot;
&quot; a little w@@ rest@@ less , she felt after the long time already . &quot;
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ moor and will see many patients certainly often , &quot; &quot; says the Bo@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; your man is suppl@@ em@@ ing : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 @-@ square meter . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pressed ahead with garden work , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels with pleasure . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls will also be high on our southern border , &quot; &quot; said the Secretary of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to the same stand .
&quot; still , it is clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum application , this can also be &quot; granted . &quot; &quot;
the safety and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; but this is clear , but also that it takes clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration streams , not on the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced , also Slovenia for coming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and it may also be cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees too . &quot;
&quot; so this is the Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however not . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; but rather the surveillance of the border - mainly to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the borders of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the minister promised , Slovenia wants to achieve its borders for refugees but not lock@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill his commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried early in the night @-@ hours to Tuesday , in East Croatian , at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d by passing through the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could interv@@ ene in the nearby Ma@@ is@@ e@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles continuously met with new refugees on the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is primarily about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days his country reck@@ on with some 4,000 refugees , the interior minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; buses from Pres@@ evo , on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which previously brought to migrants to the Hungarian border , in direction of Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade ranks however , that it is to take people wis@@ ely to hit certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do it &quot; , &quot; it meant . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Si@@ d , on the course of the day , further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; cross @-@ Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were the whole night of the approximately 500 kilometres far ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border had been on the road through Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary made it , so the police declared to us that we should come here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany . &quot;
this could actually actually be the pl@@ ough pl@@ ough of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to come to a slightly further west @-@ route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for cross @-@ control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared for the fall of a strong opposition of refugees , corresponding plans for potential utilization . &quot;
&quot; details he did not know , but pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; full possibilities for crossing control . &quot; &quot;
they conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; since 2007 , Slovenia has been part of the EU @-@ Partner country since 2007 , a positive testimony concerning the standards of border controls . &quot;
on a left side behind the Hungarian border fence we continue to hold about 300 refugees .
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports they had the past night on the border crossing , Hor@@ g@@ os , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two bor@@ derland Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees want to reach the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm down on Wednesday night at a local ophthalm@@ ologic in Hor@@ g@@ os : he ret@@ ains the debates about altern@@ ate rou@@ ts of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not at this time to be very high refugee deal .
&quot; we cannot tell whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - Altern@@ ativ@@ rou@@ ten
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee office has already begun to pass to the refugees maps , which are shown by alternative routes via Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the bor@@ derland there is also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not vac@@ ated min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of Min@@ en@@ sp@@ ans was sent in the border region .
stock h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians to pay 30 million dollars

&quot; with the exploited information , insi@@ der @-@ shops have been made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators were projected for a total of more than 100 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the current comparison shows that even those outside our borders , will finally be tr@@ apped in the SE@@ C release . &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused in the case is perpet@@ u@@ ated .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .

the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice served with this action on its 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s all about life , that &apos;s why we went through the action in the midst of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine lam@@ mer . &quot;
the leadership of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice is at disposal of pas@@ sers @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations like the volunteers .
&quot; while some argue is spontaneous to the circle and the proposition &quot; &quot; My Life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en &quot; , &quot; you can read , &quot; &quot; continue with the camper through the US , &quot; &quot; continue to stop &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long , read , say things like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , on the edge of small discussions about the action on himself , about life , the dealing with the dying . &quot;
Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; only when I make sure that for me the end of the world comes , I can responsi@@ bly live , &quot; says the director of the Diak@@ onischen Werk@@ es Mannheim , which is jointly with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband der responsible for the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ic hosp@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public opinion is good for 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everybody wants to communicate openly at the tables , whether it is comprehen@@ sible , but it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and dying is still aff@@ lic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine lam@@ mer , even though the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years has contributed much to the fact that people open themselves . &quot;
an assessment that is shared by Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
the dying and sad@@ der companion is one of the volunteers in the first hour .
&quot; through personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice occupied by call for volunteer , she immediately reported and was involved in the establishment of the year 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteer - 43 women and two men - the sufferers and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in hosp@@ ice St. Vincent . &quot;
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id can handle well with her job and experience the experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see the life of another war@@ ts , consider it precious and este@@ emed the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the patient @-@ patient hosp@@ ice service is free and den@@ omin@@ able .
&quot; the financial support of the health care and donations of relatives and associations enable the training as well as further education and super@@ vis@@ as and com@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; every two years , training for new employees are offered . &quot;
&quot; the signs described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; also there , further personal wishes can be noted on post@@ cards . &quot;
Fed@@ Ex result mixed , Fin@@ anz @-@ prospects for 2016 lo@@ wered &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports disappointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery gig@@ ant shows his prize view on a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she is planning to address around 5@@ 5,000 on@@ ward workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the market @-@ market in 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a win between $ 40 and 10,@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous pre@@ diction . &quot;

&quot; despite the price of discounts , average 4.9 percent will be effective and in spite of the higher vol@@ tages for the transpor@@ ting of heavy and large packages , which will be up@@ lifted from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expect the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company prof@@ iting &quot; solid income , &quot; considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment have been planned a day later than those of the Ri@@ val UPS that plans to adjust 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra labour forces , for instance the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , the ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at random $ per share , just below the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research command@@ ed an@@ al@@ ysts . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the h@@ acks asked analy@@ zer $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years Fed@@ Ex has resulted in the last few years a decline in international education shipping , which exp@@ el the turnover in his unit express delivery . &quot;
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the final quarter sales growth at 29 percent , but the operating result was essentially flat due to higher cost of larger packages and self @-@ assurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit increases higher income due to higher prices , while the result is decreased due to higher labour costs in freight . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trading , approximately one hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares at 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they joined 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11th . &quot;
&quot; at their most anticipated conference in the year Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen spending two days this week around a 27 @-@ minute Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table , to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since nearly a decade to up@@ lift the lad@@ der . &quot;
&quot; Dro@@ at about them at an end of the mixed , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seating area is located a wall image of the United States . &quot;
&quot; the map is a reminder of the fact that the F@@ ed @-@ Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen , and her colleagues want to set the economic interests of the nation before all other things . &quot;
the central bank has a double @-@ time order from the Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices remain stable .
&quot; but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ even third mandate , financial stability . &quot;
&quot; this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ di@@ ct them . it is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by an unprecedented interest rates , since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that they are robust , the recent turbul@@ ence could increase the recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives to increase this vol@@ ati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only about one quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ists with the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justi@@ fication , continues to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what had been uns@@ ett@@ led to the financial market itself .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , who were recently inter@@ viewed from Bloom@@ berg , have predicted that week . &quot;
&quot; however , financial markets expect to wait the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ v@@ ator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the rays drive the stroke , by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones industrial average rate rose by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1,@@ 4 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 99@@ ,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations , continuing to ward the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Editor &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you do it , they have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they do not get panic disorder . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a Zin@@ tia would calm the financial markets because it would act the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set of 0,25 percent@@ points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and in early summer , that in this year despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , the improvement on the labour market was solid in this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate sank on 5.5 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level , which the F@@ ed is seen as full employment . &quot;
sub@@ missions have shown signs of a recovery .
&quot; and although inflation is constantly running under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; &quot; can handle increased interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market &quot; , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief gro@@ oming in Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets over the world extended the end of the last month , after China had de@@ vised its currency . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was increased by more than 16 % by his peak , as investors feared that a dec@@ eler@@ ation of Chinese economy would serve the global growth of th@@ rot@@ tle . &quot;
&quot; the market has changed a little this month , with the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the H@@ och of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market uph@@ e@@ av@@ al affect the complex calculation , when you want to raise interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events in the financial markets and the news about the weaknesses of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks would not have occurred , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at U@@ C@@ LA c@@ inn@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Office . &quot;
&quot; now he says that she will be waiting at least one month to get the effects better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary authority has become the authority in the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has suffered enormously in recent years .
&quot; the mere comment of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ ards in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; tight &quot; &quot; with the F@@ ed could be &quot; &quot; tight &quot; , &quot; delet@@ ing the Tur@@ b@@ ings around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world , markets and economies are increasingly driven , can be monitored by the F@@ ed representatives , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , spot@@ ted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transitions on financial market movements that have apparently not linked to economic fundament@@ al@@ data . &quot;
&quot; cr@@ ackers , agreed member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which uses a concentration of interest in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; one financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its gui@@ del@@ ins by dozen percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognition of the growth in the U.S. , &quot; says L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives made this cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should only place the first place aspects of financial stability as during a massive crisis such as the mark@@ sman@@ ship in 2008 , Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; recent tur@@ mo@@ il occur not close to that level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she will certainly not come into the situation in which she is afraid of a Zin@@ ovi@@ position , because the markets de@@ ar@@ ded , &quot; said P@@ osen , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should be the time forward . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
&quot; to prepare you a warm welcome , not without the dedication of volunteers . &quot;

Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric Society Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy gu@@ ill@@ ings
the Brazilian organisation SP@@ RS tries to clarify how important women clarify things about how important good nutrition during feeding is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies which are exposed to br@@ otherhood that are painted with imag@@ ery of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies give all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers get to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake around 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research findings suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake are not the only di@@ ä@@ te@@ tic adaptation that should co @-@ make mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protect them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can have a negative impact . &quot;
exceptions for the new ber@@ ri@@ vals of the sports hall
the council Bern@@ ried settled the construction contract for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ forum arrive by step by step : in the recent community meeting , the revised construction programme was accompanied without great discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , the panel had agreed among others a request for a construction statutory &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; we used to make permission for a special form of the construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof with non @-@ voice first and roof survived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof space for solar systems : &quot; &quot; this means we get a wonderfully large South @-@ ach , &quot; &quot; declared mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; liberation , &quot; it was in turn around the roof , that is made for energetic reasons - other than in the development plan ( under ten degrees ) . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan regarding the roof @-@ sides no &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der municipality are usually more restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; however , at gym it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , so St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the turn@@ around at the Sports Center is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been taken to costs approximately 2.3 million euros .
supplements are expected from school and Lub@@ ach@@ ers .
&quot; in the next procedure of procedure , the building order for the 18 x 36 meters is now also the hall with the Land@@ rat@@ ory for the inspection . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed before as planned - namely , in 2016 . &quot;
simultaneously Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees are moving from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is the striking plans of the hospital GmbH of the rural district , which confirmed Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; a decision on this is however the Super@@ visory Board , and the h@@ unts of the coming Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if plans should be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would go to the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority of sol@@ le with fishermen and the on @-@ existing interior station moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees that cannot be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed of their plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic and now changes to a private practice in an immediate vicinity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; on the question of who pursu@@ es the succession comes , according to Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the direction of 1 October and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this yield in any case a &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; and wi@@ dening of the range in the area &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ ers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ al@@ ises in the inner station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; starting in the next two years , Fischer will have to agree with his team when the Super@@ visory Board will lead to the two houses , until next year the former hospital of the b@@ rag , which has still over 35 beds , in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years should finally be closed . &quot;
&quot; so far , this region had planned this for 2018 , if the current refurb@@ ishment at the hospital is completed in Wei@@ l@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ ch@@ ner J@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , who also came to Chairman of the Super@@ visory Board , with rum@@ ors that came to the property of the Federal scar@@ city , in future as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers should be used . &quot;
&quot; that I shall conclude , &quot; &quot; how it goes on with the property , Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White does not say , there were several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a natural psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; Fischer informed about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positive and very understanding by the staff &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which fishermen have worked for over 30 years as a chief doctor , did not . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened in recent decades due to closure , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the handles on the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion are required in the evening ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
&quot; the leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal , the clear Favor@@ ite , cause for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
in the last season the bad@@ ener entered the B@@ HC a painful defeat and have something to be used there .

&quot; after a wal@@ nut , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injury and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; how exactly it could come to the accident , was still unclear . &quot;
the police force was determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate victim of Non@@ violence
a Tat@@ e@@ suspic@@ ious has led the police to the cor@@ pse that has been missing since Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate .
&quot; in the trial of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the youth killed and their body was thrown into one channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; since Saturday , 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate has fallen victim to violent victim . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , like prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and the police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the second evening , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old is also valid at the service of twenty @-@ year @-@ old , who in fact led the st@@ ating said that and the investig@@ ator has led to the place of origin of the body . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday mor@@ nings , after having arrived at the eve of a autumn party in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of the autumn . &quot;
in the search for the young woman the investig@@ ator first moves forward to personal items of the offering .
in respon@@ dents in the friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the suspic@@ i@@ est flo@@ wed eventually a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; the pre@@ tensions perpet@@ r@@ ator led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the bodies were found . &quot;
&quot; the party used to put the authorities in the police station , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old were killed and the bodies were put into the channel . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be pre@@ led on Wednesday to the harbour , the investig@@ ators lay aside him nec@@ ropolis on the burden . &quot;
evidence on the closer circumstances of action shall bring the further investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ war@@ ned of apartment
the situation on the German market market is tense .
also more and more refugees search for a paid lead .
the pressure on the living @-@ market grows .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution @-@ fights on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and the seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with income @-@ weak citizens around the last paid apartments .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , must be built by 2020 every year 40@@ 0,000 new units . &quot;
this result is a study on behalf of the coalition of social housing . &quot;
&quot; to compare , this year in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished . &quot;
&quot; thereby , 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; refugees are no longer committed to the first three months of their stay , as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many come across the residential market and en@@ rolled in the long sn@@ akes in front of the rented apartments .
&quot; according to Statisti@@ cal Bundes@@ amt , however , in last year less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers had to rent . &quot;
but the negative trend in the living area is not only due to the increasing refugees .
the study also makes considerable exp@@ ir@@ sions in the housing policy of the last few years .
&quot; Germany ur@@ ges a housing deficit above , which is getting bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently l@@ acked in the metropol@@ itan areas already around 77@@ 0,000 dormit@@ ories , by Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many of the work that lived in large @-@ cities were noted in apartment buildings .
young adults remained on the home market for no longer stay on the property market with no longer stay in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined in the past few years .
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social housing &quot; suggests a new start . &quot;
&quot; in this context , new incentives will boost the social housing construction again . &quot;
thus could be wai@@ ved on the admir@@ ation tax and the basic tax for funded apartments are affor@@ ded .
&quot; in addition , according to alliances attractive tax @-@ prescription means are needed . &quot;
the funding programme for refugee information of the Staats@@ bank K@@ f@@ W is already well sto@@ cked with cities and villages .
&quot; a good week after the start was spent on the eve of 184 million euros , more than half of the currently available to some 300 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be engra@@ ved . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia opens the cor@@ ridor
&quot; in Hungary , virtually no more , there are more and more refugees choose the path over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the transit of Slovenia to North without hur@@ dles .
but that is dangerous the route is still .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian inner conductor , and if it is necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ Land Croatia is not yet a Schengen area .
&quot; after the deport@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and the Norwegian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary suffered its border for refugees on the eve of refugees .
&quot; new laws , which occurred on the same day in force , render an excessive asylum process in Hungary so super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to make the refugees happen .
Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , it is people who not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the border of Serbia in Serbia in the morning .
&quot; most of the media papers report from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came by bus as well as tax@@ en in the Serbian border city of Si@@ d .
immediately after her arrival they would have tried to walk on foot across the green border to Croatia .
refugees at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border did not reach the refugees on the border line .
&quot; this bir@@ ths the border strip of other dangers , there are still sharp min@@ ts from the Yugosla@@ vian Civil War in the 1990s . &quot;
min@@ de@@ es should therefore quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; after the closing of the border , there are hardly any refugees after the closing of the border . &quot;
on the Tuesday the police were ordered by 36@@ 6 people .
just before the deadline on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws will overcome the overcoming and damage of the Grenz@@ za@@ uns as a crime .
in the southern Hungarian border city Sz@@ eged therefore were introduced to 35 criminal procedures .
the condemned @-@ aged arrest warran@@ t up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , we took on Tuesday in the newly at the border with a total of 94 asylum messages , of which almost all - 93 - the most important passage of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people are among the applicants . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
&quot; practically , no one has a prospect of getting in Hungary asylum . &quot;
&quot; in hung@@ arian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe Third @-@ land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ or@@ ated asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; transit @-@ zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke a few hundred refugees were gathered . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to stop .
they sam@@ pled the tr@@ ash to leave the tens of thousands of people over the last few weeks at the road@@ side .
pl@@ ywood were dismis@@ sed and one of the entrance office in the Grenz@@ ort was renovated .
to the target of this re@@ building one no one wanted to express themselves .
Austria can only reach a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also has reinforced its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants then stood still in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg are about 1400 people around the way to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities .
in Fre@@ l@@ ass@@ ing regular smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
Mayor &quot; Ges@@ tr@@ and@@ ete &quot; about the border
&quot; we were after the sea party on Sunday with the au@@ c@@ ams , when suddenly ten people stood with travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; so W@@ ern@@ st@@ ein mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train . &quot;
&quot; because Germany reached a surprise in W@@ ern@@ stein on Sunday because of the refugee grid with Austria , the city council acted immediately his help and en@@ voy together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the Middle of Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we saw the un@@ hop@@ ed guests at once again , with j@@ ause and drinks . &quot;
we said that we will drive them to Pass@@ au .
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says the city council in O@@ Ö@@ N @-@ conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; a man did not let it go , to hand a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; this has made us very happy , &quot; &quot; in the city &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the ges@@ tr@@ apped train passengers were re@@ vo@@ wed from a ICE in a regional train to Pass@@ au on Sunday evening , in order to un@@ subscribe to Germany after the short notice , that the railway traffic to Germany has been dis@@ continued but still over the border . &quot;
but the regional train was set before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein is the trans@@ fron@@ tier generally high in the course .
the Br@@ ücken@@ fest along with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday had planned a two @-@ party spor@@ ty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; when Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now been sending more to us , a logical result of a seem@@ ing sacred policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the building of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures that guarantee Human@@ ism , our Chancellor continued up highly and publicly with the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ ford of National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
trag@@ e@@ dies in this policy are not only those Austrian who are now facing the border @-@ areas with chaotic conditions .
&quot; also the whis@@ pers will have to determine that the &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , faced with the continued refugee streams and the approaching winter , with us decent conditions for protecting people . &quot;
&quot; and there will be one even bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad in Search of 35.@@ 000 winter@@ s
finally she has all hands to do with the refugee control .
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government used the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker to serve qu@@ artet for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the Premiere Centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gained control in the handle .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he wrote of his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday after Austria was without great tur@@ mo@@ il , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; Master power . &quot;
the interior was on the other hand from a &quot; crown &quot; situation . &quot;
&quot; overall , reveals a total of 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ rying in the he@@ arth year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number , you have to be found even more than 3@@ 5,000 accommodations in the next weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries delivering , 15.000 con@@ t . &quot;
&quot; should it be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; Konrad . &quot;
with the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art he has already led talks .
they would have promised to it even for the coming refugees quot@@ a .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , but it shall be classified as the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; big expectations will include the asylum @-@ ordinator as well as in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation .
&quot; in addition , one hopes at hotels that are empty in the winter . &quot;
&quot; finally , Konrad and Ma@@ ier yesterday recommen@@ ed the standards for accommodation as &apos; very high . &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it can not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers must respect a certain amount of to@@ wel @-@ holder or size of the super@@ visory duties . &quot;
for a temporary period of time would have to apply .
&quot; that he was successful in contrast to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , reveals Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentl@@ eman , that one cannot imagine the face of the truth without further into the face . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause any cost , as they explained themselves . &quot;
your employees want to increase them on three to four .
the company &apos;s own mer@@ gers has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to raise a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz in the office .
but there is apparently problems with the permit .
Linz calls for better division
&quot; first , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips o Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is currently not necessary , as it is possible to present these actions without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for the emergency , however , other locations on their exchange are to be tested . &quot;
review of the city chief at the division of refugees in the state of the country .
also other areas must contribute to their contribution here .
&quot; above @-@ above @-@ above : &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer call by the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) announced the full action Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday to take additional action in the refugee request .
&quot; above , the German border in@@ sured me that the German limits are not sealed off . &quot;
continued from refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continue to be possible .
however there is now the appropriate border controls .
&quot; stran@@ ts with refugees after Germany , there will be no more . &quot;
but the guards would however be brought to Germany with regular moves .
from the other EU member states P@@ ett@@ inger also called for greater growth in the refugee request .
&quot; that now Austria st@@ ems from its borders again , is a logical consequence of &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; four of the six floors of office and production building , the stock company S &amp; T is with@@ drawn , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meter ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the clever heads are our raw material - and we must try that they are working for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ Chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can be imagined to invest in start @-@ up firms in the new ship@@ yard and later on which to mig@@ rate .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some : &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.9 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros of the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building has been operating from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square floor space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give requests . &quot;

larger po@@ ckets and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop has been put into operation .
previously several weeks ago been converted .
&quot; but I have long over@@ lay down if I still need to open a store , &quot; says broad . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a dedicated location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the Only in the Grand Masters , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who himself gave to Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion interest has been carefully placed by her mother in the cradle .
I am de@@ af with most when something developed and I can show new trends at affor@@ ded prices .
why so some woman with the sight of a nice hand@@ bag in consuming it can also answer the professional woman with the last safety .
perhaps it is because a nice bag has been upgraded for each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s ancestors made of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called for .
this property is connected also with the billi@@ on@@ aire . the US President wants to be connected .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for set @-@ off .
&quot; whether he vo@@ iced himself on account of xen@@ opho@@ bic degrad@@ ation , journalists are in relation to the international crisis policy - the applicant has a strong interest in the candidate for the US presidential campaign . &quot;
and cuts up well with them .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ian K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property legacy assets . &quot;
the New Yorker with the Com@@ promis@@ ers is many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine street a term .
man@@ holes in the 1200 @-@ resident place is about -@@ aff@@ lic@@ ted by him is related .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the elec@@ toral field . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do vill@@ agers be about his goal to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think you &apos;ll find that somehow exciting , but in their sounds are not so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native k@@ ill@@ städ@@ ter has an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous kids , to which besides Tru@@ mp is also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , which is not known for mod@@ est@@ ly , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
at the king of the hearts he did not put it there .
&quot; I respect the performance of the family , but also deci@@ du@@ ci@@ ve the opinion that Tru@@ mp is already a bit a big mouth . &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; adul@@ ter@@ ous of the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circuit , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - to Hoch@@ english : the in@@ th@@ ers , says it . &quot;
the Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the Inn@@ es .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather had hi@@ ked out and in the US a restaurant opened for the min@@ er . &quot;
land@@ stone of the real estate company were the first real estate operations in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of trag@@ ics , their desire to return to the back to the home that had belonged to the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Palatinate was in the past . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t recorded Tru@@ mp because he was once h@@ ew@@ ing with permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ alz History and People &apos;s Hospital , Roland Paul , said to the film start . &quot;
tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the after@@ ward .
the had repeatedly talked about import of Mexican immigrants in the United States and called the building of a border wall to get illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the uphol@@ ding , it is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a left relationship ( &quot; The gran@@ ny was a born tr@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the winem@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot;
does he believes that Tru@@ mp comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine it , &quot; says 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of k@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the pension@@ er Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as man@@ ent K@@ all@@ stadt , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz donated to something for the church &apos;s organ , which is generally well anch@@ oring . &quot;
&quot; this can I not imagine of Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not do the choice , because &quot; he has such radi@@ cal views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had to say at the time of his grandfather in the US , they would have been like him , he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah H@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not so , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are either ri@@ pe without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot;

the last three voices : Bachelor of Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have unk@@ now@@ ingly clearly who The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , with the Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally , became in greatest secrecy . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not exist if she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but as we treated with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may not acci@@ dentally given a cl@@ ue to who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips until the finale on Thursday - sealed
&quot; all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way , why wood is the perfect man and realized his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers to the play@@ mate , who won the heart of the torrent . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki got both quickly - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with one another from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies spot@@ ted , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I did it throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is on Earth with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so fun to be together with her , &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the company visit last week you made sure that wood &quot; &quot; could be &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now cau@@ tious on him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , whom Wood should choose , if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left @-@ loved girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be released on Wednesday , 19 : 30h , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams following receiving requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever choice .
&quot; some coaches would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost an angel , as was the Aussie Ru@@ g@@ by league league on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ es the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return , and also in the ongoing play following a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula fortified Hay@@ es on publicly during his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by special cre@@ ws in Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who spoke to him to forget his wo@@ unded catch , and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t near a p@@ unt which was restored in the first game @-@ quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it certainly was not the start to the Hay@@ ne and his massive austr@@ al@@ ment hunt for his N@@ FL @-@ debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field later the playing field and told later the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine any worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that has now been found , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;

&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the cl@@ aws , &quot; said Ai@@ ki@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ v@@ anger has called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , the way it was during the Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it doesn &apos;t work , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free vot@@ er &apos;s boss . &quot;
un@@ ned asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; for that reason , Ai@@ ki@@ osk also demanded more staff for the administrative courts , responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ makers , &quot; said Ai@@ ki@@ anger . &quot;
the F@@ W leader cri@@ tici@@ zed that several Bundes@@ länder are not consistent : &quot; we bro@@ ws nation@@ wide uniform standards of the Bundes@@ länder .

&quot; therefore , we need to be able to act . &quot;

but this goes not far enough to the Ai@@ ki@@ anger .
&quot; the theme G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W manager . &quot;
we are calling for freedom of elec@@ toral freedom for all the schools .

&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police gum@@ med into a crowd , who had demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke down in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , introduc@@ tory district officials , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters gathered outside a police station , with some of you had stones and fire@@ bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said , the police have used tracking , and then shot up into the air before they took on rubber . &quot;
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were wo@@ unded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the applied rubber com@@ rade is known that they can indeed kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the discussion was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nep@@ as southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces , which would be formed in the context of the proposed new constitution to dimin@@ ish their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal by the ethnic group of the E@@ AS who want to have their own state .
&quot; among the least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were held in violent sho@@ cks since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; being killed , when the four large political parties signed an agreement to divide the land in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been central for centuries . &quot;
&quot; since 2008 , the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 but the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors deri@@ ves the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that had killed in April thousands of people . &quot;

&quot; under the pressure of the project critical and the F@@ DP Group , who war@@ n the investors and managing secret ann@@ ot@@ ments , Ralf B@@ ehr@@ enbach directed from the system of construction management into the offensive : &quot; we did not answer all questions an answer , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
yet it is good to meet all smells now .
&quot; for months , the project has been in discussion about ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
&quot; fier@@ ce reactions among the sea owners , who had come to the meeting , build the pictures and new details on the desired hotel structure . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and manager in the interests of the lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; this becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ z , who domin@@ ates all the other bones . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he feared like several other project cri@@ tic that the traffic by the intended size of the system would increase greatly : &quot; there whole bus inv@@ itations will come so that the public anticip@@ ations &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what is exactly on the good one h@@ ect@@ are is big area of the former restaurant , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; first we have to have a conclusi@@ ve concept , &quot; said Ralf B@@ ehr@@ enbach . &quot;

the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last after a new study at least five years .
&quot; it is still too early to say whether slightly more overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery can live longer than those who do not get surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial conclu@@ ding to the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity , use different methods to dimin@@ ish the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years , Adi@@ pos@@ is surg@@ eries for treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes is proven to be efficient , but most studies were carried out in men who are sickness @-@ obes@@ e with an Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are regarded as fat . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity , medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people , which were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those that subjected itself to this operation , sank from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who were not @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who subjected himself to a surgical procedure , with 36 % the diabetes @-@ condition totally and at 28 % partial . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes is completely extingu@@ ished at only one percent and partially at just around two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were in the insp@@ ections of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; in general better in the &quot; &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best maintained under 7 percent - write the researchers .
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level sank from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as is reflected in the improved ho@@ ist in A@@ 1@@ c level - has not decreased the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also promised the average results with the two types of the surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass @-@ surgery Group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.8 % ) and directories more a complete overthrow of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of more serious people in Sweden that Operation performs to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ went to an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that has tried a conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not benefit the survival of the surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it was so@@ othing to people with a BM@@ I of 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in that lower BM@@ I group , without higher risk of death or kidney illness , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are too long waiting until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , having firm their bodies with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love story takes place in H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is a theme , which is currently growing in fiction : a young woman , too popular , too popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meet after years the sho@@ al of her youth , and this one does in love with them . &quot;
&quot; thus also in the recent @-@ chosen novel &quot; &quot; actually , we are not so &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot;
beyond love history the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ hi@@ ve readers because he plays in Lang@@ es and the surrounding villages .
the full professional author is raised in Lang@@ weiler and looks forward to her hom@@ etown a liter@@ ary monument .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and he added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of its ten day visit in the United Kingdom during his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which focuses on ethics studies .
&quot; he demanded that under given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of each nations , or even continents . &quot;
he stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ orable but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; despite the Dalai Lama and Austrian efforts to cope with the crisis , he pointed out that there is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousands of refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly due to education , for these Muslim countries can be created . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing can be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force has never solved any of these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the USA received a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I put my p@@ ity in a letter to President Bush and I told him , the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put authority and that has brought forth an unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of inf@@ ants of hand@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
&quot; Gi@@ ft@@ controls centers in the US report on an almost 400 full increase in the number of children under twelve years , which sw@@ allow strongly non @-@ infectious agents , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , has clim@@ bed the cases of revenues of hand@@ inf@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the tox@@ ics control centers , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly experiencing these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go out in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children have inf@@ ect@@ ants dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to impress your friends , or for a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
YouTube on YouTube show how young inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a budget of experience .
young people have supposed to blend dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic mouth water to get a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be ro@@ cked by attractive ra@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractions ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ umes .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange @-@ du@@ red , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
Hän@@ de@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol .
especially with to@@ dd@@ lers can already lead a few sy@@ ringe to alcohol .
&quot; it is highly focused alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ vocation Centre at the University of K@@ ansas , Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let a sip whis@@ ky around but people allow this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and if children come to it , then it is a quick option to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four spra@@ ws from after straw@@ berry frag@@ ments in the school , was brought into a emergency room . &quot;
&quot; your blood concentr@@ ating was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which in an adult is legally guaranteed to be dr@@ unk , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey said , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , who treated it in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and wasn &apos;t able to walk when she arrived at the emergency .
&quot; doctors super@@ vised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s house at signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl was fallen by the alcohol and had found his head stum@@ bled , she said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers recommended to use soft @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
of alcohol @-@ po@@ ison@@ ing were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the ham@@ mo@@ cks of Hän@@ de@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , who ab@@ sten@@ ed a toxic , non de@@ son@@ ant ingredient . &quot;
&quot; healthcare authorities suggest that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl@@ al@@ co@@ hol , which was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January the three students of the fourth class in the State of New York to det@@ ox@@ i@@ fy their &quot; teacher &quot; teacher , expres@@ sing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says it a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to Hän@@ de@@ des@@ inf@@ ective and brought them out of their space .
the police reported the ver@@ ted plan as &quot; happening &quot; and def@@ ective contrac@@ ted measures to the school authority .

the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and earlier national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no titles @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the gro@@ ove .
&quot; de Bo@@ er who currently said an Ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland there are no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the chang@@ ers aren &apos;t there .
people here are talking not only about the return of the angers .
you speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m Games , and it is not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;

&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening . &quot;
we feel the same - but we must go .
&quot; we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;

it would provide a unique perspective .

&quot; they thought that she could have been &quot; &quot; better formulated &quot; , &quot; but she is still thinking that it is wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ sip had problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ por@@ ter present to write there .
when he dies he thinks he will help the public relations of the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ por@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of pod@@ casts made I have made . &quot;
I will not go here again into all details .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
&quot; his acts according to the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty , a benefici@@ ary of fact . &quot;
yet I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of the murder .
&quot; I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death element .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
others will give other re@@ por@@ ters to which you can apply for this .
&quot; what you will get from me is what it means , a man to see an un@@ necessary death die . &quot;

Peter Moody claimed that Stew@@ ards were trying to sp@@ y him and to end the racing sport
&quot; Peter Moody maintains that Stew@@ ards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables , last year , to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he moved to the stew@@ ards and the Integr@@ ity Department of Racing Victoria and declar@@ ing that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai , because of a race day treatment , the last stra@@ w on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt pre@@ acher with Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ y war@@ fs and did not want it to be &quot; see the hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say nothing about it , and I have long been eating , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; concluded . &quot;
you know that it is running .
&quot; sometimes people react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to go down , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they begin to think , I do not do that , then I should not be more coach . &quot;
I have to think carefully what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moody had made the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integr@@ ity Department had tried to sp@@ y his stable . &quot;
&quot; in front of eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to give information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moody on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they believe that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly hold on their n@@ oses because they attempt to sum@@ mar@@ ise me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former . Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ g , wrote President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ un@@ ry , top@@ ical CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should I give me the opinion that it is personal ?
did the RV@@ L conduct himself and perhaps makes people responsible outside of the coaches for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my own license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say to you now is thinking about it . &quot;
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the head@@ lamps of the train@@ ers have been rebuilt with the long period of cob@@ alt @-@ examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching resulted in that he could put &quot; his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody , best known for its preparation of the un@@ trained master black C@@ avi@@ ar , followed the Sundays @-@ treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; after a package of mud or sound had been applied to the stag@@ nat@@ ories , which exp@@ ire against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has escap@@ ed irrit@@ ability on the leg .
it could have been that evening so .
&quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , something that was so . &quot;
but it was so on the race day .
Moody could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the racing day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules but here one went too far , &quot; &quot; concluded . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ val because of claims to ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has awarded criticism of his player as &quot; agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League Favorites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee will have allowed the Stor@@ m players &quot; Ring race &quot; with his team during the high Stor@@ m &apos;s winner in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a little disgu@@ ised note about the Stor@@ m team , after his team did the final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday evenings . he called the game a &quot; mu@@ ster example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two of Queensland not &quot; &quot; good &quot; at rings . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the t@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they are on the Tac@@ tical only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy , added that the criticism of two leading coach at his team will give him confident , as it advocates that they did worry about being be@@ aten from the Stor@@ m team . &quot;
&quot; that emerg@@ es again and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ fights when she had told us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that in the whole year nothing we have changed at our defensive system or the techniques . however , over the past six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es into a real centre , and this has undertaken for us the trend revers@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not getting used to lose weight , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
&quot; it is already strange , as this is repeatedly emerg@@ es from this season . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Ill@@ awar@@ a Dragon won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks about exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St. George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a sh@@ re@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team who can play and play as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his way of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play them . &quot;
&quot; I make a stronger trust , because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about us to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think of us when it comes to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy pointed out that the game Stor@@ m against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks - do not make any points a bit of cl@@ amping ?
for me it is the schedu@@ les .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase yet . &quot;
&quot; the Stor@@ m team has released this weekend , since they have won the right to welcome either North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ k on the next Saturday night in the Pr@@ i Park . ticket sales begin at next Tuesday morning . &quot;

&quot; a man who could potentially have a life @-@ long penalty stro@@ ve for his su@@ cking to his possession of 40 kilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine produced by Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot;

Mak@@ si@@ doc@@ c was observed how he found his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse where the police found 40 kil@@ og@@ ram of the drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; despite having possibly lik@@ eli@@ ous punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c that he tried to possess the whole quantity and that the café could have been from a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judges at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the flight movement of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relationships with Serbia .
&quot; he often travelled to Serbia , &quot; explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of a criminal case , he has ben@@ ded the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and st@@ ep@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the in@@ fi@@ dav@@ its of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden . &quot; &quot; he said F@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from it , not to appear , war@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ doc@@ c was released against security , under the conditions that he det@@ ects his Australian and Serbian Pass , announces daily in the police and at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

&quot; he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , and he asked to send them more photos . &quot;
&quot; he said that he did it , to l@@ ure them . &quot;
&quot; he said he is sick in the head , when he drank , and said , he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Robert@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the tre@@ m@@ bling , and in the crying . &quot;

the crowd makes it : every two years the auto@@ immune at the I@@ AA show their innovations .
2015 is primarily responsible for the compact days which are currently attemp@@ ting to sell .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations were affected by the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone on this segment alone .
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( audience @-@ stage 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury rooms , and luxury cars are presented in this year primarily a lot of new compact designs . &quot;
Opel Astr@@ a is one of the greatest Premi@@ um@@ ers for the German auto industry is the Opel Astr@@ a who will stand in the deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astr@@ a is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the heart of the brand .
&quot; thus the volume of the volume is also well sold , the new Astr@@ a will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is launching an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astr@@ a costs from 16 990 € .
the Astr@@ a is available with a new 1,@@ 4 lit@@ re motor with 74 kW / 100 HP .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen , further diesel engines and gas@@ oline engines offer from 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 b@@ hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gas@@ oline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , there is the Opel Astr@@ a first only as fifth . &quot;
&quot; as a second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is already seen on the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will be forced aside from the Astr@@ a on the I@@ AA to new comp@@ actor ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astr@@ a competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as fifth in a conventional and an emph@@ atically active GT @-@ version .
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he will come as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ spin@@ off@@ s will find his position in the highly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; thus , the compact Infin@@ iti fits with his curved lines fully in the design line of the brand . &quot;
the base model will get a petrol motor with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 HP .
but in the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celeb@@ rates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gas@@ oline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 lit@@ re @-@ ste@@ ep@@ ot@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS . &quot;

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five sqm are man @-@ worthy
&quot; the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht ) has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the T@@ ails right , which was to be accommod@@ ated in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; due to the injury of their human dignity , in@@ mates are generally eligible for financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
sufferers may even now hope for money if they were im@@ pris@@ oned only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ prisoner with its Constitutional order will be successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cub@@ icle of around five square floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not dis@@ connected . &quot;
&quot; then the man , who after his lawyer &apos;s testimony was now at an open base , has been displ@@ aced in a larger cell . &quot;
his Am@@ t@@ sh@@ aft@@ ungs@@ mo@@ v@@ age due to the un@@ worthy arrest warran@@ t against the Land of Berlin .
&quot; however , the constitutional rec@@ ti@@ ers hopes to susp@@ end the judgment of the Court of Kam@@ mer@@ ce Berlin and transferred the case to the renewed testing . &quot;
you see the human dignity of the man .
Chamber of Ap@@ pe@@ als now decide on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons , a few days prison assembly could be largely made for the compensation , be an equi@@ voc@@ able statement , was it meant . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; an inter@@ ing of the legal protection of the personality would be to fear . &quot;
the chamber of Ap@@ pe@@ al must now clarify the amount of the money injury .
the constitutional rec@@ ti@@ fiers often have reinforced the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; so they spoke only in April of an in@@ dem@@ nity for damages , because he was being confin@@ ement in a cell . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , as well as the multi @-@ layout of a cell , without a separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , in addition to the Berlin Constitutional Court , he agreed to a decent accommodation in a parall@@ el@@ fall in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the then r@@ ack@@ et was taken over three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons have been going to be head@@ lines in the head@@ lines in the last few weeks .
&quot; prisoners will therefore always be enclosed in 23 hours , the aggressi@@ veness , even for s@@ lob@@ es , it shall be due to the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information by the judicial com@@ press@@ ors , 21 places in T@@ egel are not occupied because of young people , 19 should drop off . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are to come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry , according to statement by vic@@ ek@@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) is Germany even able to absor@@ b a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say once again and again : we can do this and we create it . &quot;
&quot; what comes to Germany , provides the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , each year - namely the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living room but above all in affordable rent : annual 60 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing from the rental delivery , and around these especially favorable apartments are also applying for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) is therefore willing to double the promotion , from now 518 million to one billion euros at present . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing would have to arise annually , and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
researchers and Federal Ministry of Finance agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction .
&quot; according to the estimates by the Institute for labor market and occupational research , it must be assumed that 55 percent of refugees who have been engaged in Germany in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not systematically ask for their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , Project manag@@ erin for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in the sponsorship society , but also for the self esteem of the migrants , says Mig@@ rations researchers Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the work of work for refugees to recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; during the event there was an employment award for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this period was reduced to three months , as well as the residen@@ cy , asylum seek@@ ers limited to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , too , it has become possible - also because of the qualified labour movement - majority of view , asser@@ ted that refugees should be made possible with access to the labour market faster . &quot;
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
&quot; so far , there is still no special offer for general and professionals @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs will be shared most often by personal contacts .
the design of networks is therefore integrated into the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt on the König@@ s@@ weg .
&quot; the Berlin office administration has found that only a few vol@@ ts parents spend their children in the kit@@ ten , estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root &apos;s parents , it is only once very important to summ@@ arize the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in Berlin Senate administration . &quot;
&quot; to persu@@ ade the family , nonetheless , to convince the benefits of the Pre @-@ ita , the management is distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for res@@ eller should increase greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to raise the training capacity - by adding more specialized schools . &quot;
in the countries students without a German knowledge are prepared for teaching classes .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no defect , says Be@@ ate St@@ ays from the Berlin government administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany are expected to study .
&quot; in principle , no State asylum seek@@ ers or th@@ dul@@ ent the study - the only exception so far Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude now . &quot;
&quot; with refugees , the access to the university could be facilit@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or den@@ ying , do not receive power after the asylum seek@@ ers Act more when they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; generally , the latter do not receive a BA@@ Fö@@ G , as they do not fall under the circle of the characters . &quot;
&quot; the refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , so that he shor@@ tened the Sp@@ anne to 15 months from January 1st , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; but this financing body needs to be closed but Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; in future , Islam will play an important role in future because many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
the state should gradually inv@@ ent the same rights as they have the churches and the existing state @-@ Ch@@ urches to develop into a new state @-@ religions .
it would also be the founding of the Islamic welfare state which takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights also belong to the rights .
&quot; thus the representatives of Islam should agree on clear contacts , and be prepared to work with the state in many fields and to put certain control options . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the willingness to control and to act against religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , vo@@ iced the concern for religious conflicts could also be registered in Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out these conflicts in Germany , &quot; have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said at Bay@@ rische ischer Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will continue to be a topic for the entire society in future . &quot;
&quot; thus , the majority of the majority of society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination point and an equality law .
&quot; however , it is slowly lear@@ ns how the N@@ SU @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie demonstrated , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what Mig@@ rants organizations and stakeholders are non @-@ han@@ dic@@ ant German for a long time , and oblig@@ ing international agreements , such as anti @-@ racial crises , must remain in the coming years when the country should remain peaceful and use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to supply the previously anticipated refugees medi@@ cally , is the German President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , it offers additional money to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , ur@@ ges all suits to be excluded in the registration of health cards . &quot;
power services could later be settled with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and in the long @-@ term , it is highly question@@ able to cast so many people with the restricted power catalogue , see the asylum seeker law . &quot;
otherwise make the doctors primarily set the language barriers .
&quot; so far , the Berlin science ch@@ anc@@ ellor The@@ a Bor@@ de has been proven , migrants are worse than other patients than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical offices would have to cost interpre@@ ter costs , she demands . &quot;
so many refugees would also have been helping with more general medical institutions in the emergency out@@ patient .
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugee centres there are clearly more untreated disabilities , and with the young people it is going to get HIV @-@ enlightenment . &quot;
&quot; with the partial other path@@ ogen@@ s , German physicians from their training come out but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite or Tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to recognize . &quot; and what concerns the lack of lack , whether by the refugees or even all@@ evi@@ ation in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed education system , several refugees or even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to be able to practice , however , they would need to demonstrate their qualifications and would possibly leave testing again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees in Germany are sick ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) according to estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ sych@@ ologist ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) . most suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic exposure or depression .
&quot; in a particularly vulnerable manner , Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee deal is traum@@ atis@@ ed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from an post @-@ traum@@ atic res@@ o@@ unding loading system , is suffering from the very so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , di@@ zzy sp@@ ins and de@@ fi@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are sleeping , and concentration disorders , powerful fri@@ ght@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to avoid that the symptoms would chron@@ ically be chronic , be a early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill @-@ patients receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; though , psych@@ ologically ill @-@ seek@@ ers can place an application for psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices most often in the workers or doctors , who are not trained for the mental illness or doctors , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new st@@ aging &apos; passion &quot; the Circus itself continues to look back upon the traditions of cir@@ cus .
&quot; the goal is to pull each age group in the spell of amaz@@ ement ac@@ rob@@ atics , wildlife and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the cir@@ cus invites into the man@@ ege on the tile at was@@ ps to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine without living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie , animal and juni@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this slogan is the current crisis in mind . &quot;
already for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus is well @-@ prob@@ able in the hands of the family .
the gift to inspiration is the family thus in the blood .
&quot; we are important to take away the people away from her everyday life and take her to a completely different world for two hours , stressed the 27 @-@ year Jun@@ i@@ o@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ en@@ cock@@ tail with world city flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard As prob@@ ing his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 km long tour can now experience this lifestyle .
the program of cir@@ cus ends with talented artists from around the world .
honoured at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family draws the audience with wit and charm in her spell . &quot;
even the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent film we want to release the Cub@@ an duo .
&quot; light@@ ness and mot@@ ility - with these words , they identify themselves . &quot;
their humor@@ ous art at the m@@ ast should conquer women &apos;s heart in the storm .
except through numerous salmon sal@@ ons the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the cir@@ cus @-@ prob@@ ing also with fing@@ erti@@ ps and joint .

for He Yuan no problem .

W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and intri@@ gu@@ ed with their mobility .
60 presented by twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ anies , Brigitte and its . &quot;
failure in the attitudes of cir@@ cus are only too often subject to different animal rights organisations .
&quot; Stephanie is also taking place , &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals , it is also not good for us . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy a pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ legged artists &quot; &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read by the possibility of every request from the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to be in the ring . &quot;
so the su@@ preme requirement : good for the animals worry .
&quot; specially on their z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ allo@@ y Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a z@@ ebra @-@ stu@@ d , is proud of the family . &quot;
the two animals have spent eight years in a pen and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , was our little Jum@@ bo da , &quot; tells Brigitte and rehear@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; the z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the ring , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus itself . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor to be part of this .
&quot; one is for sure , &quot; says Stephanie , &quot; &quot; whether five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are happy with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus will be held from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s col@@ dest guide , fell down at the beginning of the year from a podium . &quot;
&quot; he remained in@@ ju@@ red , but the video of the case spread quickly on the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament has also been asser@@ ted by declar@@ ations by Members of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous deaths , and war@@ ned that they were war@@ ned to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; last month she had f@@ ted him , and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the nation in the parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions in SMS messages received on their mobil@@ es which they were war@@ ned to inter@@ fere with them .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists writing to Mu@@ gab@@ es . &quot;
&quot; they war@@ ns the affected Parliament members , that the immunity in the Parliament termin@@ ates , and as soon as the Parliament leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;

Hewlett @-@ Packard becomes up to 30.000 jobs dis@@ assemble
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25.000 to 30.000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the services of the company .
HP will split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business of its fast growing company hardware and service providers .
&quot; the expected job construction leads to a burden of over 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , told HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who shall conduct the unity after separation . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise is becoming smaller and stronger than it is HP today and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support companies with the transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ att@@ acking , integrated technology solutions for companies &quot; , &quot; thus an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s from the gradu@@ ates from Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett @-@ Packard , and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring through to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC maker and one of the largest U.S. tech company , is the latest in this area based on conviction that closely related companies will yield a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the ver@@ final Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere must be
&quot; it emphas@@ ise against Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and provided its rehabilitation to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss for at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its involvement in the next summer is certainly still uncertain . &quot;
the great shame on this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old cur@@ l during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by the career , &quot; T@@ wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that not well healed .
this is not a greater matter .
this was only an accident .
&quot; it was not in conjunction with his buttons , or with the injury he had previously had . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from purely medical view , but like turning it acknowledged , there is the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of further injury , always when a player is trying to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd for@@ ks 23 various diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider image for arsen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs which have to record most of accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; turn accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in vulner@@ ability during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have an acci@@ dental period , a time wher@@ ein you will strengthen your body and gain battle force , &quot; &quot; said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope its body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track along the coming Wednesday and Wen@@ ger is a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , what means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta starts to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with Ki@@ gi@@ b@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Ni@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it , a small kick @-@ off &quot; , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al is clear favourite is to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir &apos;s stadium in Zagreb is one of the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation of Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ struck after 41 matches , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was started in the last season . &quot;
stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake that were measured on the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th place in Zagreb .
&quot; it is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn up the teaching of the past season with the Champions League of Monaco , and remains driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the association to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ocal@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot;
it has never worked on arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for males to open up to now have become more des@@ perate than ever before , as self @-@ murder in young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important number of deaths among men aged between 20 and 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more often in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in trying to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ks ( calm - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 as the year of man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask for help if they need it . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer gave a enough high percentage of friends with a healthy mood . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , bi@@ absorbed a circle of spiritual healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; of course , you have to have friends first of all , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of more than social media , communication with a focus on substance is often more important than a significant contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to appear strongly , vital and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by that which psych@@ ologists have extrac@@ tive values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more profound . &quot;
&quot; and as a vide@@ og@@ ame @-@ invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money cannot really buy happiness . &quot;
the Beautiful at Friends was that this foc@@ us@@ sing placed on the head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , defined by interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s cra@@ yon hu@@ gs , moments when soccer play in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came from knowing that men can definitely hold back , even if they often with@@ hold her , completely their feelings to explore . &quot;
&quot; how an employee of the telephone makes it explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; my audi@@ ences to people who feel depres@@ sive and self @-@ investigated , has really demonstrated me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
men who contact us feel often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; the old Rede@@ mption &quot; &quot; I come along with that &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems . &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that come in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term mut@@ ation mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so very my objective external status via the phone to help the people in moments of des@@ per@@ ation may also help , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you had to visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest , with the celebration of the day completely new craf@@ ted setting , why do not take your friends to have a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see on your own in Star@@ bu@@ cks somebody alone , give him a smile and tell you Hi . &quot;
one never knows what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to mal@@ m@@ mal@@ ate
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Aqu@@ arian Cav@@ ani following his hits against mal@@ m@@ ö .
&quot; di Maria met at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to aid PS@@ G , to Malmö . &quot;
here are the Game Report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Wood@@ son son Cav@@ ani held course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ c@@ park@@ on on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the French champion on the way , but afterwards they promised a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead toward Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A needed Paris a strong start against the Swedish champion , since it was not only stri@@ ving for the qualification rounds , but improving on the way to the quarter @-@ finals on each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class@@ ay@@ ey of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s missed chances in front of the gate . he later began in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association , with which he began his illustr@@ ator career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents to cause problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things we need in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it that we have not scored one or two additional goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to his trial in one of three changes to the Paris team that could hold the weekend a 2 : 2 oun@@ ced on their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was engra@@ ved in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine wing stor@@ mer was considered the man to bring PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malmö defense , before he concluded on Johan Wil@@ and past beautifully into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would be a great victory , the PS@@ G was disappointed . &quot;
mal@@ m@@ edo@@ ara hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level joined by An@@ pi@@ ff on the field and was one of a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle @-@ field ru@@ ined a heavy opponent .
&quot; but apart from a kiss by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who has gone far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself got sometimes on , with some mis@@ ses and bad waste , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who was in no less than five minutes alone in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had caused him to restart . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill if he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c to the Di Maria into a shoot , which was made by Wil@@ and during the 5@@ 2nd minute on the P@@ posts ... &quot;
&quot; finally , the second goal was finally ready shortly after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . it thus achieved his sixth win after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended up all the thoughts that Malmö could return into the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ low from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , before replacement player Ez@@ ra Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized as a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , Age : observation , gave rise to that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat from front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; eight times of Spanish champion , three times Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger , four times champion winner , two consecutive year world champion , two times Europ@@ am@@ master , a time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
in summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old after 24 years the FC Barcelona saw the FC Barcelona and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca T@@ avi , X@@ avi is now convinced that he was already standing before the 1st 2008 before the departure from Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; you said , I want to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid was at that time everything , we says nothing . &quot;
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; there was a offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ard wanted to have me .
to remember : in summer 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
&quot; Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi is not altern@@ ated
but the change did not come about .
and the be@@ zz@@ lement man is working today for the German record Grand Master : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains , why : &quot; Bar@@ rel has put Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
P@@ EP has told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me .
&quot; so , he has won me . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns season 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi had gone .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against the whole distance on the lawn , ball@@ ted the Red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end of the king classes . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in the film @-@ making
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American fil@@ mm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion of diversity and said they don &apos;t need behind the scenes .
&quot; during a result of the Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown break down as it stressed the need for alternative perspective and in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the elected screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the cast of the show . &quot;
Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked with off@@ beat un@@ belief and called &quot; wa@@ hoo ! Wow . okay . &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian was gri@@ lled .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the manufacture of Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will also be the director , how they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line , which is struck by her white slip . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People set out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the director @-@ rights to the film ; Dam@@ on er@@ res@@ ists that their direc@@ ting will give us something , what we do not want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion has been highlighted , the social media from dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter , Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain its diversity - this is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et awarded more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ ons comments arrive at a time when accurate racial representation is at the top of social discussion .
&quot; after the Teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement generated black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter country @-@ wide impact and displ@@ ac@@ ent legisl@@ ator and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against colour content . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made a revival on the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ ination albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums silent , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums have still their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leader of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s movement have published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , if the group should be regarded as hat@@ red group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le that are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portr@@ ay@@ al of the Catholic Church in the west . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pop@@ e is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; kr@@ ön@@ t first champion
&quot; professional ath@@ t@@ weather and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American nin@@ ja Warri@@ or in Monday evening and took the Great Prize of 1 million $ at home . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , completed just their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant to finish all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the seasonal , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the finale . &quot;
the last task belonged to the climbing at a 75 minute long clim@@ ber in 30 seconds .
&quot; took up the task within the time that he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete to completed the first ath@@ l@@ ete , which ended the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , making it a winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero talked with e ! messages after tough victory , still under shock over winning the Great price of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never deser@@ ved more than 10,000 $ or have been in life , &quot; said Isaac E ! read his p@@ ile of money . &quot;
as suddenly as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leader producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter , to discuss the final and why B@@ ritten had ended up , although he finished first at all the par@@ cours , does not get any prize money . &quot;
according to the rules the money goes to the fastest .
&quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alists , the one gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and life changed he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he won any celebration at this .
he is just so happy having done what he did .
hon@@ ours of awards it received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt so if they had changed roles .

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins past
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier they once was one of the best teams in bas@@ eball than today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League of Central .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfect against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field . &quot;
the tw@@ ins sp@@ ans a chance to move within a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ Card .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return to the three letter F word which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
Tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fredo Simon gave his early offensive support when Detroit joined three times in the first two inside and then once again in the sixth and then in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times on in 1 / 3 cour@@ ings and made three runs for us .
it was only a third of successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go deeply into the game . &quot;
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks : his first R@@ B@@ Is since the middle of August .
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has pi@@ v@@ aded well , &quot; said ex@@ cre@@ eping . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( brass training ) , looked clearly better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three ranks in the rear in the end of the seventh inside , the tw@@ ins had their best chance to get back to the game . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left line line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks finished in a colorful and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier for the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ de Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy ran a wall , the only man with which he was confronted before of the Rook@@ ie ro@@ ok@@ ie Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ ances the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen to a two @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing @-@ run on the second brought cas@@ h@@ unts to the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ tly , to a double Play . &quot;
it was that in the major league leading 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ps had a double play .
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inner , an R@@ BI @-@ Double against the c@@ act@@ less of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed sla@@ p , however , with three pit@@ ches for his fifth place . &quot;
Detroit op@@ ted to the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game from a still not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers obtained three ranks among us in the first two inside against the sp@@ elling veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the viol@@ a list after having been missing for a back @-@ up more than one month ago .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted to tell me , &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I pushed and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; once they received the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter , Hus@@ bs gave a single at Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought up Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ es in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third of Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third that the threat ended . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second with a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ osis to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
he did not eat very well but he caught the right place .
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was located in a Pit@@ ch Count , achieved no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ war@@ ts . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three ranks with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez was born because of a violation of the worm school .
he is being investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who was supporting the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ chez , since the mid @-@ August on the risk of inj@@ uri@@ fication , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez in the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris from the accus@@ ation list is removed to start against the tw@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 in four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since then it was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July . &quot;
he has been missing for a gu@@ itar@@ ist in the right course since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ERA ) is playing against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees to arrive in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees came on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected on Wednesday for the night .
&quot; the ear@@ thy people should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on the Tuesday evening . &quot;

Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; the manager of the Munich &apos;s Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , maintains military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think that think about military action options may not be held without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he threw out the European states &quot; collective &quot; . &quot; &quot;
four years ago it was glad that the Kel@@ ch has gone to a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict is cr@@ ashing before our front door , &quot; he said at Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German amb@@ assador to Washington also demanded a massive increase in international aid for refugees .
Austria is controlled by southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria once again adopted controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian interior of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner commented on Tuesday evening at the Austrian television stations &quot; OR@@ F , &quot; after Hungary no one again will be returned . &quot;
Germany too sent no refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; to the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there has already been a relevant conversation between the Direc@@ torate @-@ General for Public Security and representatives from Germany . &quot;
concrete figures call them not and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the last days tens of thousands of refugees came from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is usually Germany .
ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied together with several other EU heads of state and government a special summit for next week .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; so far , the EU states have not yet able to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot;
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take on the next Tuesday ( September 22nd ) at a special meeting for the binding distribution of other 120 000 refugees .
&quot; given the strong refugee team in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first @-@ time @-@ up and distribution of the people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government plans to pursue this together with the countries , Merkel , announced the late afternoon after almost four years of consultation with the Prime Minister in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor &apos;s office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who want to protect and conf@@ ess them . &quot;
&quot; but who is not a lead @-@ perspective , could not remain in Germany too . &quot;
this view was divided into the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole would now be a &quot; huge power of force . &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees stuck in the meantime on the route route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours on it announced the government in Budapest , also to the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia on the EU .
&quot; Hung@@ arians w@@ ool that the tu@@ gs were examined in Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to the planned new Grenz@@ z@@ au@@ n . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan promptly .
there were first det@@ ention of people wanting the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , there were few more migrants to show thousands of migrants on their way to Greek border . &quot;

&quot; while this exchange movement is only small , but still too big for a non @-@ consistent cel@@ esti@@ al bodies , it is said in a communication of Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers make their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; journal .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but who wants to watch out for his sl@@ ender line , that is often more likely to get off from them . &quot;
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
&quot; healthy are the exotic fruits yet : in them are B vitamins , as well as the vitamins E and C. on all , man@@ goes man@@ goes a lot of vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits , supports the strength , immune system and metabo@@ lic processes in the body . &quot;
when buying Mang@@ os should not be too soft or too tight and smell .
the shell@@ fish @-@ color alone says nothing about how mature the fruit is - so can also taste green man@@ gan@@ os very delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed inside a few days .
then they of course taste pure or sweet food .
but a man@@ go also gives a special dishes a special touch .
they mer@@ ges the slightly bitter taste of Bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ate like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

on Wednesday and at night to Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n sometimes partly with storm @-@ star@@ ch .
&quot; after the Com@@ promis@@ ers on Thursday morning we crossed a striking off @-@ front , the vigor@@ ous rain falls , wind turbines and a temperature desc@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; like Mete@@ o@@ News in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front side of an extensive deep @-@ field over the British islands in a powerful south @-@ western background . &quot;
on the night@@ side and on the night out of the mountain passes through the valleys .

&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , the mineral v@@ öh@@ n for summer temperature rises from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity is beginning to di@@ gest at the night@@ mare . &quot;
here rain continues to hold until Thursday nights .
&quot; overall , the south of the Alps must be counted over the next 48 hours with some more than 100 lit@@ ers of rain a square meter , this has been falling into large rain @-@ amounts in the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the F@@ öh@@ n goes forth the air , in the result it rolls up a cold front with vigor@@ ous , partly sho@@ cked rain from west to east through Switzerland . &quot;

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther Square .
&quot; in the presence of Stadt@@ presidential President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino on Wednesday , a very loose place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill , was bap@@ tised in the name of the German reform@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Collabor@@ ation of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; J@@ ens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded of Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the pop@@ e over centuries often could only live in secret their faith . &quot;
&quot; with the place I am clearly visible , that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the annual turn in 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he then received the town then as a sc@@ ure .
his negative impressions could be supported by the historians in his later fight against Rome .
Lu@@ ther did then put in with his th@@ eses against the exp@@ ul@@ sion and the spl@@ itting of the ab@@ zz@@ onian church .
hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( spi@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible has painted .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and written bi@@ bel@@ tex@@ te .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Bible , which is now appearing with su@@ mp@@ tuous pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes have received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means in@@ significant with &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the respective topics may seem quite dark . &quot;
&quot; around three years Ot@@ mar Alt to his Bible project , for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many them@@ atic areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles emerged are cycles , which devote themselves issues like cru@@ ising , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; with this , he has spont@@ aneously thanks to several partners : this is true for the Lu@@ ther publishing house with its the@@ ological outlook as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his main focus on art books . &quot;
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost which is on the basis of painting with the Bible points .
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible , and has interpreted the Bible , and thus translated into the current circumstances &quot; today . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like hi@@ des mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; nestled in the original Bi@@ plane of Martin Lu@@ ther , and each one set of the artist , who here formulated his very personal thoughts of the respective situation here . &quot;
the jewelry Coll@@ ar has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old thus allowed twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
that is a high degree of intimacy .
&quot; emotions was ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant rulers . &quot;
&quot; then the education already happened with the tube stock , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work out , to work with the Lord again too . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to have more status in the fast @-@ pac@@ ed time , saying : &quot; the perception of educational worlds is marked today by advertising and which is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being pushed away .
artists have a different desire and we@@ ars to show things .
pictures always have something mysti@@ cal and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer go down into the pictures , &quot; &quot; let them act , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the picture looks for its counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , and on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation , &quot; has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he understands lives with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; old I have no respect to grasp the Bible , but that is important for him , also mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is about the pictures , the text explained only . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from the Lu@@ ther Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and finding freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for mo@@ unts as well as the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .

DF@@ B increased commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B has expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga rel@@ ies on the weekend a clear sign . &quot;
the football is responding to the p@@ itz@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its aid to tackling the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there , in principle no one can say , it doesn &apos;t matter anything , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested to get a grip on to this topic in the grip , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and step there the State Department of Mrs O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the subject will certainly play a key role , &quot; announced it . &quot;
the football would be and wants to help .
but the pi@@ vot@@ al course is to provide the policies .
&quot; the Deutsche Football Association therefore has expanded its refugee Initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; to have extended four years . &quot;
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation we ensured that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some federal states support this program .
&quot; already this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ick will set a clear sign when it takes place on the left tri@@ cot@@ ine instead of the usual sponsor of the usual sponsor ( Her@@ mes ) &quot; &quot; We will help - # cosm@@ es@@ welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only &quot; &quot; said Lever@@ k@@ ens Ru@@ di V@@ ö@@ ller of the &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and recorded the project as a &quot; granted . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama goes every one , nobody is allowed to take away . &quot;
&quot; we cannot find football federal states , no , we have to use our radi@@ ators , our influence and our ways to help the many refugees who have been so unbeliev@@ ably to help , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ unk@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to the EM qualification game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes the support for refugees as a &quot; &quot; large collective work of German football &quot; . &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license must have launched on their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and smallest gaps are active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; that we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous significance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will collaborate with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government in each of 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also called for the whole sum of 2015 , &quot; reported Y@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Vor@@ al@@ ef loses an eye in an accident
&quot; the pioneer of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports , due to over@@ throwing early July the left eye . &quot;
&quot; during the accident at the stairs in the house of his brother in the US he had fallen after midnight on a water glass , which he took in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost ble@@ eding , was impot@@ ent , then he was taken out onto the road - that he tells us so the last week , quoted the &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ver &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder H@@ asso Plat@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go down to his work .
&quot; early October we meet in front of the Super@@ visory council in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Plat@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 year old Manager will be present at the meeting and are fully employment . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( on Thursday confirmation ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to introduce the software engineer . &quot;
&quot; I am fully designed for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I stood all the time in a regular contact with the Super@@ visory Board and its chairman H@@ asso @-@ Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German @-@ head office in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; let him be important to go into the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; anyone can happen so something . &quot;
important is to be up again if you please .
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ spare pilot magn@@ sia except skir@@ m@@ ish ...
&quot; it &apos;s a relative photo and explained , he suffered the injury , when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
&quot; he therefore comes to the night@@ club in Singapore on the weekend as a reserve for the two families Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback by Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa League will finally be destroyed .
the National@@ theater is also missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him unfortunately , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us on Sunday will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga team against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach was open again : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high burden of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his pedi@@ m@@ ess at the re@@ us position . &quot;
&quot; so , he announced a change on the p@@ ub@@ ation position . &quot;
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will take up the place of Chief ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football @-@ teacher the world champion . &quot;
&quot; if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller arrives in the future in all Europe League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el would be open . &quot;
with a high degree of probability he will also have the second part .
the for@@ sche statement from fellow @-@ players Re@@ us that the Fin@@ als of BV@@ B in the Europa League will be the target to track mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; that makes Marco not so wrong .
&quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title , &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants the lead role in Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be pioneer in the shift of the cars in technological pioneer . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Minister decided on Wednesday a Strategic i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which inter alia investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; &quot; new mobile &quot; &quot; age . &quot;
&quot; the automated , connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide less support , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , which at the I@@ AA meet with representatives of the industry . &quot;
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Department of Economics emphasises the importance of mobile broad@@ band set @-@ up and a fast response to digital radio .
&quot; as a result of testing new technology , a testing occurs on the highway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; with the driver &quot; no extra virgin risks , the German government wants to examine the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to stand up for example internationally that the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars of 10 to 130 km / hour is raised . &quot;
&quot; the federal government plans to work for a change in the Vienna Convention , so far that only human beings can only be seen as a driver . &quot;
&quot; when automated driving takes over as increasing the car , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that may capture the environment and process the data in a matter of seconds .
&quot; according to a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the trial will be technically possible on high@@ ways to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected far from 2020 . &quot;
&quot; value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and the high @-@ automated driving functions on the Federal Republic of Germany appreciate the authors of the study on around 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport policy S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability with accidents and the security of the drivers , however , must be clear clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are skep@@ tical , however skep@@ tical - a lot more than French or American . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday at the AA presented survey by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing institution , Dec@@ ra comes to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that sufficient cars invest in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of the respon@@ dents are expected by 2025 @-@ driven cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey with Bit@@ k@@ om , only seven percent would agree to complete control throughout the trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway that , over 15 percent , it could even imagine that in flowing traffic , it is 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; each year , the car would not be left to control under any circumstances . &quot;
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to fight for the current status of the title , of 25 September to 4 October only in the single case . &quot;
the final decision will be at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning .
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo on the title &quot; , &quot; said Bundes@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ Award in Düsseldorf . &quot;
B@@ oll has been at this point on the flight to a long term well arranged Sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are now no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; stated single @-@ Europ@@ am@@ master Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the s@@ ander list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also reminded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo was also missing , and we have grown in Europe . &quot;
&quot; by this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the world @-@ lists . &quot;
the English football @-@ player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has drawn up an severe injury to the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a watch@@ word Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition through his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins which thanks to video proj@@ ections are frigh@@ tening .
&quot; they carry out the spectacular creations of the French designer , among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage @-@ fits for the big star of the mos@@ quito scene - and with it that he put men into the skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant one of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was so light , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From A side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 , an art hall of the HY@@ PO Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ et ters had changed his first way to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been on the contrary , because : &quot; for me the exhibition sounded a little bit after death &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
if you die it goes into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s unlikely work , written in the fashion history , without ever getting an education completed . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically is the show not built , but it is an outstanding chore@@ ographic work that was done for much effort : to fr@@ ze the doll@@ s , for example , a sty@@ list is engaged . &quot;
14 tonnes of material made the creators according to the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the October time there was also a special treat : a leather h@@ osen @-@ out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are worse than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy is seen in the exhibition .
&quot; it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ic con@@ sol@@ ation of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad at football ) he was attracted to his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; playing with a d@@ oll , his parents were not allowed to him . &quot;
so that dismis@@ s of fashion have he then joined himself .
he st@@ ole mode@@ ms and looked at the dr@@ afts of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
but later I bought it naturally .
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they did not get anything , they were allowed to keep the cl@@ am@@ ot@@ ting . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion niche
formerly there went on long nit@@ el@@ ines in and around Pl@@ auen to do meters .
&quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and peaks have emerged in large amounts for customers , which they re@@ worked for example to blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ desp@@ air Pl@@ auen . &quot;
instead the fashion is very important .
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ der tip , fashion was playing a major role , was then pushed away by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and with regional trailer . &quot;
&quot; at all the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode , which reson@@ ates at past styl@@ istic periods , an acceler@@ ating order . &quot;
who has not served in Germany in the textile sector in Germany is no longer the market .
we are already doing half of all orders .
Mo@@ desp@@ air Pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies member of the branch association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they must carry out the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , roughly 80 percent of its sales have been broken . &quot;
private stores and wholesale are almost no longer available .
there are hardly any of our products to the customer on this path .
the mass factor is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
&quot; in addition , the export of exports to Russia and the United States . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score on environmental awareness , such as Cor@@ du@@ la farmer explains in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; for this year we conduct a seal of quality that shows that we are environmentally and socially responsible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt complements : &quot; this also applies to the materials used .
diploma Design U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty for Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and points .
&quot; to counter the competition from the Asian region , one needs to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a voltage between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and businesses that must think mostly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design will often only be easy to maintain a customer base . &quot;
a couple of years busy textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historical snow @-@ tip new .
embro@@ i@@ dered the machine in some places small villages .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ d@@ smith in Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ stri@@ pe let yourself be inspired , &quot; &quot; before I was able to do nothing with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the Snow@@ y tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate technique they character@@ ize the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; they also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose anc@@ est@@ or would have lived in peac@@ o@@ cks and surroundings , and who would like to have a reminder . &quot;
so I don &apos;t see my jewelry as the modern amb@@ assador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; -@@ film

&quot; according to &quot; entertainment Weekly , &quot; however , it is not about re@@ viewing , but rather a kind of continuation , which is 20 years after the first movie with the magic n@@ anny . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the F@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of world economic crisis in England .
who P@@ opp@@ ins plays in more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .

XI pus@@ hes that the economy open wider to the world
&quot; the economy must be wider and open towards growth , in order to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping at the Tuesday of a group that was asked with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should work out to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business partners , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central management group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new cur@@ ves and promote reforms , will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list for the regulation of the market access , relaxation of border controls , promoting state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the residents of Mel@@ des@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; following the statement , a negative list created , the sectors and companies identified for investment not to be questioned . &quot;
the system will be tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of significance , since they indicate the market a greater part in the al@@ location of resources , a constitutional business environment and designed open to the market , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also conc@@ ise controls over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to run their business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also said that China &apos;s border areas will allow to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; opening in the framework of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas of private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments , and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the Statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is made easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by performing the requirements and the application process can be facilit@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the law of lawyers to ensure their activity , and professional judge and prosec@@ ut@@ ors were also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
at the meeting also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as was reported in a joint statement .
EU wants to double Mer@@ cury @-@ border on rob@@ bery
the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mer@@ cury in large smoking areas and consumers thereby gain a significantly higher dose of nerve damage .
&quot; the consumer organization Food@@ watch , which is an appropriate working paper of the EU , cri@@ tici@@ zed the plans sharp@@ ly : &quot; risks and side effects of faul@@ ty industrial and co@@ dd@@ lers @-@ passed , &quot; declared Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt by Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt said that the border values of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ous for big fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; are raised from one to two milli@@ gram qu@@ ec@@ o@@ grams per kilo@@ grams of fish . &quot;
&quot; big rob@@ bery @-@ fish , however , must be deb@@ ited from the fact that they are not sold so strongly on the basis of valid border values as 50 per cent of the foot@@ notes . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be fatal . &quot;
&quot; in return for this all@@ uring , the EU according to Food@@ watch wants to tigh@@ ten the limits on other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; food did not refer to this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller gra@@ ves , such as carp , mostly so low , that they already keep the planned high@@ s already today . &quot;
&quot; the reduction in brack@@ ish was therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant distr@@ acting , which helps the economy , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
&quot; mer@@ cury is one for man &apos;s high @-@ toxic heavy metals that extends over the food chain above all in rob@@ bery . &quot;
the federal government war@@ ns that &quot; low amounts of especially in the ne@@ p@@ ups of the nervous system can cause .
&quot; on its homepage , the Federal Ministry of Environment is explained on its homepage with regard to the valid values but that a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general community &quot; is not expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury comes primarily through coal burning into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information given by the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German Federal Ministry of Labour has come to the Gre@@ ens @-@ Bundestag Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year 2000 , two thirds of the total population converted into Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish , such as El@@ be , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and surface @-@ covered &quot; , &quot; had c@@ ited the &quot; mirror &quot; in March from the paper . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings before mer@@ cury in fish are already among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ Warn@@ em@@ system RA@@ SF@@ F . &quot;
