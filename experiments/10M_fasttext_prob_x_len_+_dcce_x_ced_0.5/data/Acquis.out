&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ destru@@ c@@ ous guilt of member states that pay upon request in the currency of the concerned state to order to order as administrative of the special problem , and at the rear @-@ point of the organisation in the concerned country . &quot;
&quot; ( B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , and indeed i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . H . the grant of 30 days after the entry into force or any other between the EEC and the administrator at the time ; &quot;
II ) the second in the amount of the balance sheet for 1 . January 1979 or at another time that agreed between the EEC and the administrator taking into account for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every@@ one state can provide payments before the above @-@ mentioned schedu@@ les .
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker takes in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , about dis@@ proportionate Zion@@ ists to the cash or the Schul@@ k in order to cover the expenses for the special problem , and to equi@@ p the special account in appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; when gran@@ ting this loans , the car@@ et@@ aker according to the conditions of the EEC can be guided by the following factors : &quot;
III ) the scope of the economic and fores@@ een economic problems of the country in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ een economic problems of the country ;
( VI ) of the composition and the tendency of debt service of the country and its further credit capacity for arm@@ rest conditions without negl@@ ect ; and

I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the preceding . &quot;
agreements in the form of a letter of letter between the European Economic Community and Bank for International Sett@@ l@@ ements on the mobili@@ zation of the Member States under the medium @-@ term financial contribution
the BI@@ Z could close stand@@ by credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tors if the banks make an appropriate request .
&quot; the agreements could be closed until the total amount of the credi@@ tors to the mechanism , namely within a total limit of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 b@@ illing units ; this is equivalent to 50 % of all future provisions of the member states . &quot;
&quot; however , there are now some conditions called for the BI@@ Z , for whose application the BI@@ Z would be ready . &quot;
&quot; at each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would initially assume a commitment for two years , with the possibility of extending stocks , without which a total of five years would be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of loans as well as with their et@@ fed extension , the BI@@ Z would calculate a credit for credit . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the first Zion@@ ists should not be equ@@ ated before the end of a month after completion of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liqui@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; the Zion@@ ists would be made available at the BI@@ Z in the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in U.S. dollar ; they would extend to time periods that would be taking into account the funds of the bank , expected three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ Z are applied to similar conditions at the time , i.e. interest rates would largely meet the market treasures . &quot;
&quot; if the BI@@ Z has to establish the necessary means even on the market , then the interest rate could be applied to the application of interest rate , which corresponds to a corresponding margin of increased Lib@@ or . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would communicate with the Council of the European Communities with the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on the trade with Ham@@ mel - , Lamb - and goat meat &quot;

&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled Ham@@ mel - , Lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand becomes a New Zealand for Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat meat , access to the market of the community in the agreement laid down in agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal paragraph of its Ham@@ mel - and L@@ amm@@ ite are not drawn through the application of the regulation in compassion .
