&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Transport Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the committee on Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) assessed , in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or their treatment , please read the package situation ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets that take part in the mouth ) as a solution to take ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and ins@@ anity ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , a psychological disorder , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods ab@@ normal sky@@ line ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe severe episodes and prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
injection @-@ solution is used for quick control of increased dis@@ ruption or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution to the entry or the mel@@ ting tablets can be applied in patients who are getting trouble of tablets . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who are simultaneously used other medicines , which are to be eliminated from bili@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l probably appears as &quot; partial ag@@ onist for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in low dimensions considered the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine by schizop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder play a role to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain whereby psychological or man@@ ic symptoms are reduced and their repar@@ ation will be prevented .
the effectiveness of bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms have been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of injection @-@ resolution has been compared in two studies of 8@@ 05 patients with schizop@@ hr@@ enia or similar disorders which compared to increased un@@ rest during a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy has been stabil@@ ised over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to stabil@@ ised the rein@@ deer symptoms already with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of bili@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that was increased in increased un@@ rest by the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients using a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients suffering from the treatment were examined . &quot;
&quot; the company also led studies through to examine how the body decreases the mel@@ ting jack@@ ets , and the solution to inc@@ att@@ acking ( rising ) . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the inj@@ ecting solution , patients suffering from 50 mg , 75 mg or 15 mg received , a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than plac@@ ebo the recur@@ r@@ aging episodes in previously untreated patients and if it was additionally administ@@ ered to an existing treatment . &quot;
bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also decreased more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to inser@@ tion ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extrac@@ ur@@ red disorders ( constant motion ) , pul@@ ling ( constant traction ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , resting and exhaus@@ tion , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) approved the conclusion that the benefits of bili@@ zation in the treatment of schizop@@ hr@@ enia , and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and with those the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l talks , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection @-@ resolution when rapid control of increased dis@@ ruption and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schizop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to prevail over the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission gave its authorisation to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd .
&quot; A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y has been indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder , and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended dosage for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a reduction dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dosage for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schizop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients &gt; 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ al@@ dose should be considered as clinical factors that justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ction is derived from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the appearance of su@@ ic@@ ide behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder has no raised su@@ ic@@ idal ris@@ ko with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic diseases .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , cardi@@ ac disease , cardi@@ ac disease , treatment with ble@@ eding drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ es@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which a year or less di@@ gesti@@ ble , there were occasional reports on during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l on@@ ward Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; when using an A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient develops signs and symptoms developed to a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied in patients with var@@ ic@@ ide cases in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or with states that are applied with caution , with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ osis diagnosed with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , a raised mortality compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; there were however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the An@@ no@@ un@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related events with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , patients who allow direct compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight gain is generally seen in schizop@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia , the application of anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , where weight gain is known as side effects , or a un@@ healthy li@@ vi@@ ability and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable if Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with out@@ going side effects such as Se@@ al ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a stomach @-@ acid blo@@ cker , reduces the rem@@ uner@@ ation rate of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l to 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should have similar tin reductions . &quot;
at CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ abolic disorders can result the common application with highly effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plas@@ mak@@ eover of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l as compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ abolic disorders .
&quot; if one considers the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks to patients . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ed@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reduction . &quot;
&quot; according to the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage should be lifted from A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y to the tin @-@ height before the beginning of the companion therapy . &quot;
&quot; Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 jointly administ@@ ered with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , may be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations . &quot;
in clinical studies show cans of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l per day no significant effect on the met@@ abolic disorders of the sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an @-@ Rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should get to be informed if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns of animal studies in pregnancy , this medicine must not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk to the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ otic patients , patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to use them , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ go@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects appeared more frequently ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 ) on than below plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the below mentioned side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schizop@@ hr@@ enia is treated in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , a total of lower incidence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with nec@@ op@@ eri@@ as ( 5@@ 7.2 % ) . &quot;
a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l @-@ treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients below plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a different controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients suffer from Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l @-@ treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium . &quot;
during the long @-@ time period of 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine conditions appeared , no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( Cre@@ atin @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ go@@ zo@@ l patients compared to 2.9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects which may occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and above their appearance also during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the launch of market research , acci@@ dental or inten@@ tional risk transform@@ ations with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of a tick @-@ change in treating an over@@ dos@@ ed with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis has a high power supply , as Ari@@ pi@@ da@@ z@@ ole has a high power of plastic . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors will be convey@@ ed .
Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ or and for Ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ or as well as an excessive aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to the alpha @-@ 1 @-@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recipe .
in case of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy prob@@ es showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in force of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 recept@@ or lig@@ ament , at Nu@@ cl@@ eus cau@@ dat@@ us and the Put@@ ters . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schizop@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study was a week 52 of the Respon@@ sibility of patients who are interested in the study media , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from Mess@@ r@@ als , which were defined as secondary studies , including a PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sion rates , showed a significant stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizop@@ hr@@ enia showed a significantly higher reduction of the return rate involving 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind trial in Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , over 26 weeks , the 314 patients experienced a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.5 kg at an average weight of approx . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with an an@@ ical or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed a compared to plac@@ ebo over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l compared to plac@@ ebo no excessive effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ at and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with an Andalusi@@ an or mixed @-@ controlled episode , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed a compared to plac@@ ebo over week 3 and a half @-@ rate effect , which was comparable to li@@ thium or nec@@ op@@ eri@@ ous in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ red zo@@ l also pointed to a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic Rem@@ is@@ sion of the Man@@ ie , such as li@@ thium or semi @-@ optical dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits in therapeutic Ser@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um , revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patient , which had reached a re@@ mission ahead with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l compared to plac@@ ebo in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly in preventing a re@@ por@@ es in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vit@@ ro studies , the enzy@@ mes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the expansion of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ational is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;

&quot; with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , there are no differences in the phar@@ ma ine@@ tics between male and female healthy professionals , as well as a pharmac@@ ological investigation of schizop@@ hr@@ enia patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a data @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics has no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or impact of smoking on pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure .
&quot; a single @-@ dose study with aut@@ um@@ radi@@ al liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , but the study took only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;

107 The following side effects appear more frequently ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 ) than below plac@@ ebo or were classified in clinical trials with or@@ ist Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) classified ( see Section 5.1 ) :
a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.5 % in patients below plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients suffer from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium . &quot;

in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as Agi@@ pi@@ go@@ zo@@ l inj@@ uri@@ al solution associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms of those acting and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders related to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference farm .
the observed medium instrumentation from the output value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour final point was 5.2 for plac@@ ebo , 9.6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe fri@@ ction , a similar effectiveness was observed in terms of the total population , but a statistical signature of Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ kan@@ z could be determined due to a reduced patient . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schizop@@ hr@@ enia showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) compared to plac@@ ebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study was a week 52 of the Respon@@ sibility of patients who are interested in the study media , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from Mess@@ r@@ als , which were defined as secondary studies , including a PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg cli@@ ent@@ rates , showed a significant stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizop@@ hr@@ enia ( oral ) showed a significant higher reduction of the return rate involving 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind trial in Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , over 26 weeks , the 314 patients experienced a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.5 kg at an average weight of approx . &quot;

&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week &apos;s study program , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l had achieved a re@@ mission prior to plac@@ ebo in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly in preventing a re@@ por@@ es in the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours following in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % greater the AU@@ C after gift of the same dose as the tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until reaching the maximum plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ eg@@ els at 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injection @-@ injection has been toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated gift at a system@@ ic exposure to a system@@ ic exposure to 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .
in studies on reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity to intraven@@ ous application no safety @-@ relevant concern for mat@@ ern@@ al exposure to 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bit ) above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg was given .

&quot; considering the patients being treated for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between medicines and survival in relation to the deterioration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , in patient , patients had received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , with regard to these indicators , that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine . &quot;
it may also not be applied in patients that are breast@@ feeding or prior to the treatment of low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ol@@ es in the blood .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) set up that Abra@@ x@@ ane is no longer able to aid effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine and that it must not be used in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines . &quot;
January 2008 the European Commission &apos;s law@@ ros@@ cience Limited shared a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .

patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy should always be recommended in recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ im@@ iter in adults respectively between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
&quot; the iron values of all patients are before the treatment to verify that there is no iron gel , and iron supplements should be administ@@ ered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who receive a chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an an@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thereby , that the body speaks not sufficient to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell into which one gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as inj@@ ecting in a V@@ ene , as part of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients infected in one by kidney problems , with the reference paper . &quot;
&quot; all patients participating in this study were at least eight weeks long E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene , before they were either launched on se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change of hem@@ ost@@ asis values between the beginning of the study and the assignment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also laid the results of a study , in which the effects of a bl@@ amed se@@ amed to be examined under the skin from E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in the 114 cancer patients , who received one chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients infected in one by kidney problems , the hem@@ ost@@ asis values of patients who were killed on se@@ amed , in the same dimensions , as for those patients who continue to be E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to the patients , who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , a rise from 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl from the output of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that occasionally lead to symptoms of an ep@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ aging mig@@ rate head@@ aches and turbul@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied in patients , which may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; se@@ amed as inj@@ ecting under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney issues , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) approved to the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed under the provisions of the European Union has been proof that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide , is provided for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the security of the drug . &quot;

a rise in hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ s around more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability of patients , occasionally in a patient individual hem@@ ost@@ atics system can be observed over or under the hem@@ ost@@ atics target . &quot;
&quot; in view of these hem@@ ost@@ atics systems should be tried over a corresponding tin management system , the hem@@ ost@@ in @-@ target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.4 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;

&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks in the hem@@ ost@@ asis size by at least 1 g / dl ( for@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproduction number is increased compared to the output value , the dose of 150 is 20 / kg times per week or 450 g / kg , should be maintained once a week . &quot;
&quot; when the hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ ds rose by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; br / l / l ) and the reproduction number &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl compared to the output value , the dose should be raised to 300 kg / kg times a week . &quot;

patients suffering from treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin at one ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ o@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should be preserved ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ia ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke inside one month before the treatment , inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk to deep cl@@ ots ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ sch @-@ known thy@@ ro@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic intervention , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are con@@ train@@ dicated in case of severe coron@@ ary heart disease , vas@@ cular disease of the car@@ oti@@ an or zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; for patients suffering from a recently registered heart attack or car@@ ni@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;

in clinical trials a higher risk of risk factors have been observed if ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese @-@ stimul@@ ated active ingredients ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ - target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit to be attributed to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ine when the hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ ical concentration on the control of ana@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions required .
hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ ds should be approximately 1 g / dl ( for@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ cy coron@@ ary heart failure should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target @-@ concentration section .
&quot; according to the present findings , by the treatment of an@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency not accelerated . &quot;
in chemotherapy should be taken into consideration for assessing the treatment of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gases and the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ duc@@ ted ) .
if the H@@ B increases is larger than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ B @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) must be matched to the risk for possible arthritis @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the goal to keep the ha@@ iry level between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
&quot; the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk reduction in the patient &apos;s participation , which should also consider the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients , which are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic intervention , if possible , before the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
patients who have under@@ gone a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic intervention as they have an increased risk for thro@@ es and vas@@ cular disease which have been particularly imp@@ acted by an underlying cardiovascular disease .
&quot; in addition , it may not be excluded that when dealing with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a initial patient @-@ glo@@ omy of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk for post@@ operative arthritis and vas@@ cular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , for epo@@ et@@ ine , it was not proven that they can survive for tum@@ ours with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or less@@ ening the risk of tumor . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which was given a chemotherapy if a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in @-@ target concentration of 12 to 14 g / dl ( 7,5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) &quot;

from in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies of tum@@ ors there are no evidence of a interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF related to hem@@ at@@ ological differenti@@ ations or prolifer@@ ation .

the most common side @-@ effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .

survival and tur@@ tles have been studied in five large controlled trials with total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were dou@@ blin@@ ded plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in the overall survival between the patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin to patients and the check@@ ers .

overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thy@@ ro@@ ses and related complications in combination with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients and checks are satisfactory .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ genic events in tum@@ ours that are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are treated to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tum@@ ours that are treated with chemotherapy using the aim of transferring a hem@@ ost@@ atics system under 13 g / dl , as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the super@@ vised data . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( an ail@@ ment which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after the men@@ opause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ tion@@ risk , including in patients who have recently suffered a low trau@@ mati@@ cal gir@@ dle as you have suffered ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the Kno@@ op , an ail@@ ment which changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with gir@@ ders should be obtained before the first inf@@ usion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by inj@@ ecting into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or in@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta , which in the three days after the inf@@ usion symptoms , such as fever , muscle aches , gri@@ ps ache and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta may be prescribed by physicians who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; because the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta the same is as in zom@@ eta , became a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta &quot; rating of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; during the first study , almost 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of spine and hip re@@ visions over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study involving 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis for over 50 years , recently suffered a gir@@ dle , the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months long with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the salary of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ase in Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me that builds bone substance ) in the blood or by at least 75 % compared to the output value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of sp@@ ri@@ gen@@ dum among patients under the A@@ cl@@ asta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cine ) was reduced to plac@@ ebo over a period of three years compared to the patients below plac@@ ebo by 70 % . &quot;
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ ente ) with those under plac@@ ebo the risk of hip ri@@ gen@@ cies was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with gir@@ ders 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta must not be applied in patients which may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ca@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other Bis@@ cot@@ ics or any other components .
&quot; as with all the bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to the risk of kidney and risk of kidney , reactions to the inf@@ usion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( with@@ ering of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides information material for physicians to apply the A@@ cl@@ asta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which includes how to use the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients , in which the side effects of the drug can be explained and pointed out whenever they should consult the doctor . &quot;

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended by intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta once a year .
&quot; in case of patients with a low @-@ trau@@ mati@@ cal hip , the administration of inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operational care is recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta should be prescribed by physicians who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus . &quot;
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta , a long Rem@@ is@@ sion period has been observed in patients who raised the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium found in patients with mor@@ bus Pag@@ et . each day , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the Gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with a recently reduced low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , an initi@@ al@@ dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , i.e. , or in@@ tra @-@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion . &quot;

the clinical evaluation by the treated physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefits risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , may be reduced by gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; incidence of than serious side effects in cases of Vor@@ hoff@@ li@@ cular was increased by patients , the A@@ cl@@ asta , increased ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 from 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT , HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ ves Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of Vor@@ hoff@@ li@@ ction between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2,@@ 6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.8 % ) . &quot;

Ni@@ eren@@ functioning Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was expressed by kidney functioning ( i.e. an increase in the type of kidney function ( i.e. an increase in Ser@@ um @-@ Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as an acute kidney failure .
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured before the administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were compared in a clinical trial at oste@@ opor@@ osis in a clinical trial for over three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after gift was observed at 1.8 % of the patients treated with the A@@ cl@@ asta patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values performed by 2.3 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical trial , compared to 21 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study for the avoidance of clinical frac@@ tures according to a hip , and in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on avoidance of clinical frac@@ tures , the vitamin D @-@ D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however the majority of patients received an initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in oral field is acci@@ dentally , above all in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the or@@ tho@@ range ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ ate acid , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental implants .
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients joined Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose at a cran@@ k@@ cill@@ or at one with A@@ cl@@ asta and with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
&quot; in the event of over@@ dos@@ ed , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ cr@@ um@@ emia , can be achieved by glu@@ ing of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at a balance . &quot;
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta to@@ mg once every year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ als &lt; -@@ 1.5 and at least two light or moderate 1 medium @-@ T @-@ Score for the shr@@ ubs of &lt; -@@ 2.5 with or without any signs of an existing spine .
effects on morph@@ ometric sp@@ ri@@ gen@@ cies A@@ cl@@ asta lo@@ wered significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the incidence of one or more new ver@@ teb@@ re@@ visions ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta treatments received patients from 75 years and older had decreased by 60 % reduced risk for sp@@ inal purposes compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 0001 ) .
&quot; effects on hip re@@ visions A@@ cl@@ asta , a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a total of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip ri@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased the bone density to the steering @-@ acid , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment significant to all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 % of the bone tissue of the wheel @-@ spine , around 6.7 % , of the whole hip for 6,0 % , of shr@@ ubs by 5.2 % , and the dist@@ al radius by 3.8 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of Knochen@@ bi@@ op@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic camera . &quot;
a micro@@ computer analysis ( µ@@ CT ) -@@ analysis showed at the A@@ cl@@ asta patients compared to plac@@ ebo a raise of the tr@@ unc@@ arian bone of bone and the conservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ul@@ ular bone architecture .

the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dosage reduced by 30 % significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the output and was kept at 28 % below the output value to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting point after 12 months and was kept in 52 % below the output range up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting point after 12 months and was kept by 55 % below the output value to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirror have not been rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a intake of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 exc@@ uses oral or in@@ tra @-@ muscular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) compared to the group of A@@ cl@@ asta group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study increased the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D at the complete and shot at all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment conducted more than 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo &apos;s treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % on the total length and by 4.3 % at the hillside .
clinical effectiveness in men In HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were considered 5@@ 08 men random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged by 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures amoun@@ ted to 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.9 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) was the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta in comparison to the once weekly gift from Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate compared to the percentage of the Len@@ den@@ wir@@ bel @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the output value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the Kno@@ ist A@@ cl@@ asta was studied in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ cal@@ ised water v@@ ase of the Kno@@ op ( mean Ser@@ um @-@ mirror of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate ) according to the sum up to 3,@@ 0@@ times average size normal compared to intake in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of inf@@ usion of 5 mg of cent@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ ate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparison .
&quot; during the combined results , it was observed after 6 months a similar decrease of pain and pain influenced in comparison to the output value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as a Respon@@ sive study at the end of the sixth major study ( on the therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who were able to participate in the follow @-@ up study , compared with 71 the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron , compared with a middle duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients took the following pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ d took swi@@ f@@ tly at &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;

the early distri@@ butions ( α and β , with the above ½ -@@ values ) probably present the rapid restructuring in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h there are 39 ± 16 % of the administ@@ ered dosage in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body @-@ clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ age concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ation against time ) . &quot;
a dimin@@ ished clearance by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzy@@ z@@ ym@@ ate met@@ aboli@@ zed substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed by humans and because they become a watch@@ er or not a direct and / or irrever@@ sible drug dependence on the P@@ 450@@ -

resulting in fact that an easy ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney @-@ stroke of up to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment to the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid requires .
&quot; as for heavy kidney , clearance ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity is the highest not let@@ al @-@ intraven@@ ous m@@ osis for mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; for studies in dogs , single @-@ types of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C das 6@@ fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administ@@ ered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; Sub@@ chron@@ ically and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application was obtained by doses of 0,@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day intervals ; in dogs a 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion within 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the number of the human therapeutic exposure , referred to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) , well toler@@ ated . &quot;

&quot; decre@@ asing blood levels of gender shor@@ ts , above all o@@ est@@ rogen made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , the bone structure is carried out too fast , and new bone material is built im@@ pregn@@ ated , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta acts by rein@@ for@@ fei@@ ting the bone structure , thereby giving a normal bone formation and thus gives the bones again strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or may have a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you may be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or the nursing staff if you use other medicines or have recently been used / applied , even if it is not prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you take drugs , of which is known to damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ asta together with food and beverages , you are aware that according to the instructions of your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administ@@ ered by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion in a V@@ ene .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , the administration of the A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operational care of the hip . &quot;

&quot; for a long time A@@ cl@@ asta for a long time , you will need to take another dose until one year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions exactly , so that the calcium mirror in your blood in time after inf@@ usion does not too low . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta can work longer than one year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
if the administration of the A@@ cl@@ asta fits into contact with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date .
&quot; before ending the therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta fall , you consider the ending of the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta to@@ e , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion occur very often ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , after subsequent infections but less frequent . &quot;
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after administration of the A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

patients with a recently reduced low @-@ trau@@ ma correction is recommended to increase the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the surgical supply of hip explo@@ sions .
&quot; before and after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients must be supplied sufficiently with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inc@@ ision of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure can develop a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium for patients with mor@@ bus . at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift from A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The document is a summary of the European Public Ap@@ pe@@ dic@@ ure ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the committee on Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) assessed and assessed for recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
&quot; accounts is applied for the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as not insul@@ in dependence of diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ medication ) is not displayed . • It can be applied along with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ al medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) . &quot;
&quot; it can additionally be used to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular , overweight patients ) that cannot be satisfactory with metals in the highest toler@@ ated dosage . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ stoff or insul@@ in , the previous dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insul@@ in can be maintained except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insul@@ in can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the physical insul@@ in can be improved in better and the blood sugar level , which allows the type @-@ 2 diabetes to be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 400 patients were examined the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ a therapy ; they received patients a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ nit@@ rogen , in addition they got up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in studies the concentration of a substance in the blood has been measured ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which ensures that blood sugar consumption at the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were cut . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a Sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ nit@@ rogen made in a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values , whereas the additional gift of plac@@ ebo has led to a reduction of 1.9 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and insul@@ in has been studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients , the accounts in addition to insul@@ in , compared to 0,@@ 14 % in patients , compared with 0,@@ 14 % in patients with additionally plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( cold cuts ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ etic th@@ esia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; accounts may not be used in patients who may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or di@@ ab@@ etic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ dis - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that accounts within a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients should be displayed when met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
October 2000 shared the European Commission of Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the transport promotion of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white until white , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the mark@@ er &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also displayed for combination with insul@@ in in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insul@@ in , and with which met@@ form@@ in due to con@@ train@@ dic@@ ations or intoler@@ ance is in@@ appropriate ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years old are no data available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; for patients who are endangered through the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or oil , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve . &quot;
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure to gain weight gain and o@@ de@@ cks when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insul@@ in .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was carried out .
&quot; in this study , there was an increase in reports of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
patients with increased output values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm@@ ality ) or with other signs of liver illness must not be used Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
if the AL@@ T mirror is increased up to a 3 times the upper limit of the standards are the liver enzy@@ me to control the liver enzy@@ me as soon as possible .
&quot; if a patient symptoms developed that point to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , redness , appetite , and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , the liver enzy@@ me to check . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on continues , should be led by the clinical parameters from the clinical assessment . &quot;
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been proven to be a dose @-@ dependent weight which may be due to obesity and in some cases associated with a liquid re@@ ten@@ tion .
as a result of a her@@ modi@@ fying revolution came under the therapy with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( relative reduction to 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.3 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controll@@ able studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ iry by 3 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.7 % ) .
&quot; as a result of the increased insul@@ in objectiv@@ ity consists in patients , the pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral therapy or triple @-@ combination therapy with insul@@ in combination therapy with insul@@ in , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; following the launch of the launch was conducted under the treatment with Thi@@ r@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ans , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , about an occurrence or a deterioration of a di@@ ab@@ etic bro@@ o@@ ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual ac@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men should be a direct link , but ver@@ ord@@ n@@ ants physicians should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular treatment ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic evaluation should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summar@@ izing analysis of unwanted events concerning bone brood from random@@ ized , controlled , double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the calculated cargo incidence was 1.9 tri@@ llion per 100 patient @-@ years with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures for women , who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years to study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.2 % ; 1,0 Fra@@ im@@ ents per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients with patients ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient ) with patient patients treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is wan@@ ing ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics or Phar@@ mak@@ o@@ dynamic of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) result in an increase in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on to the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 indu@@ tractor ) resulting in a reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that under the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , it dimin@@ ished in pregnancy and increased insul@@ in resistance to the mother &apos;s pregnancy , and thereby reduces the availability of met@@ abolic subsidies for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; highly frequent &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( resulting in this data is not estimated ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the Tur@@ g@@ ors and the computer @-@ index@@ es of the lens , as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs . &quot;
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on performed AL@@ T @-@ An@@ stick on the thre@@ e@@ fold of the upper boundary of the standard area often like plac@@ ebo but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ stoff .
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , the incidence of severe her@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was by 1,6 % higher than below plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the launch of the market , it was rarely reported on cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , more frequently when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insul@@ in or in patients with ges@@ tive in@@ suff@@ iciency in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it became a summary analysis of messages of unwanted events concerning bone brood from random@@ ized , controlled , double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in patients with compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years running the pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.2 % ) performed with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) for patients with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; at intake of the maximum high @-@ dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to work over an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads in the animal model to an increased insul@@ in sensitivity of liver and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has reduced the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose in case of insul@@ in resistance .
a clinical trial with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the after@@ math of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &gt; 8,@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the beginning of therapy , a blood sugar control has been maintained ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients treated under the limbs ( compared to 50 % of patients under the limbs ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo@@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was dis@@ continued in spite of three month &apos;s improvement phase with insul@@ in , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo random@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the medium H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0,45 % , compared to the patients who continued to get only insul@@ in ; a reduction of insul@@ in in the group of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated group was observed . &quot;
clinical trials over a year showed themselves at Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the album / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ cies compared to the output values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , on 18 weeks laid down the examination of type @-@ 2 di@@ ab@@ etics . &quot;
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction in total plas@@ ma @-@ tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as low @-@ slightly , but clin@@ ically increased significantly increased L@@ D@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years of reduced pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plas@@ ma gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
compared to plac@@ ebo was found no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values were observed .
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was not only the so@@ ber @-@ down tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved the en@@ viable increased tri@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ eri@@ de levels , in terms of an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular research study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ di@@ advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease in groups , which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral use , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is rapidly res@@ or@@ bi@@ ased , with top @-@ concentration of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in plas@@ ma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in roughly the triple the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ action studies could be proven that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical @-@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 indu@@ ction ) increases or lo@@ wers the plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ation of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ active pi@@ red pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mar@@ ker was mainly found in the f@@ ool ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the medium Plas@@ ma Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ ady time of un@@ changing pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on amounts to people 5 @-@ 6 hours , and those of the entire active met@@ abolic group is at 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centric ations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its met@@ abolic disorder are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy volunteers , but resem@@ ble the diplom@@ ats of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother &apos;s substance . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ology studies , in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys coinci@@ ded after repeti@@ tive administration of plas@@ ma @-@ volume with hem@@ or@@ ution , an@@ emia and re@@ versi@@ bler ex@@ centric cardi@@ ac hyper@@ trop@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on that dimin@@ ished in the con@@ dens@@ ation of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insul@@ in resistance to the womb , and thereby reduces the availability of met@@ abolic subsidies for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were in@@ duced in the rat @-@ elevated inci@@ den@@ ces of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ red epith@@ eli@@ um epith@@ eli@@ um .
in a animal @-@ model of the famili@@ al @-@ om@@ at@@ ous pol@@ yp@@ osis ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ r@@ oli@@ d indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of color@@ ectal cancer .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the mark@@ er &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated cargo incidence was 1.9 tri@@ llion per 100 patient @-@ years with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures for women , who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years to study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.2 % ; 1,0 Fra@@ im@@ ents per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients with patients ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient ) with patient patients treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
in another study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in combination with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year at Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the album / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ cies compared to the output values .
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was not only the so@@ ber @-@ down tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved the en@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ eri@@ de levels , in terms of an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ end@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as has no insul@@ in can produce , and type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use the insul@@ in effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ane led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ spi@@ der , pointed out that the blood sugar is much reduced as strongly as with another Human@@ insul@@ in . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ane should not be applied in patients that may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ insul@@ in ( pure DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; besides , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ane may need to be adjusted , if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood@@ sugar ( the complete list is the Pack@@ ag@@ ation system to be found ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) approved the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ one in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks out@@ weigh .
October 2002 the European Commission shared Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ af@@ ane throughout the European Union .
&quot; insul@@ in products are usually applied once or twice a day , when a quick initi@@ ational effect will be desired together with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
&quot; the inj@@ ections must be kept under the skin at least 6 seconds , to ensure that the whole dosage was inj@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved for example by a intensified insul@@ in therapy , can notice the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; every change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insul@@ in type ( fast acting , biological , long effective insul@@ in , human@@ insul@@ in or insul@@ in an@@ alogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insul@@ in animal origin ) can cause that a change in dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; if changing to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ane in the patient a dosage adjustment is required , these may be necessary during first dosage or in the first few weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change of animal on human insul@@ in appeared , reported that early warning shows a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia less pronounced or different than with their previous insul@@ in goods . &quot;
&quot; travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , because such trips can lead to that insul@@ in and meals are being used at different times respectively . &quot;
the doctor must therefore take into consideration possible interactions during therapy and to ask for patients always by other medicines .

&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 762 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary tract was in the blood at the last three measurements among 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study we had 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily dose 120 mg in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was about 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and ab@@ normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with cardi@@ ac disease , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) approved to the conclusion that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary tract in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of the Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) that were conducted with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary active ingredient point was in every study the percentage of the patients with which the last three months of certain Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ egel &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were included .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ worth to study starts by &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed in terms of lowering the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ egel under 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both for the treatment with conventional used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study demonstrated with regard to lasting reduction in Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els under 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both for the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dosage Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

primary cross @-@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney functional ent@@ angl@@ ement The AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney ent@@ angl@@ ement ( i.e. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C the primary key focus of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient . &quot;
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ants of commission rates including their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function ) .

&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the sealing size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the shift no@@ des until month 24 . &quot;
&quot; increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5,@@ 5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ an ( 5.5 % ) and also received in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.5 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for treating oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one disease , where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ opause , in which there is a risk to a low vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; patient needs to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or deposits of other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and Vit@@ amin@@ supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place early 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 have already been separated from each other in medicines which are authorised in the European Union , the company placed data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ als women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D level .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients were treated with reduced vitamin D in the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those with those exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also laid data in particular , that the dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE will be exactly the dose which is required for the prevention of a bone of bone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tive systems such as abdom@@ inal disorder ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diges@@ tion ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( blood vessels ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( blood vessels ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( blood vessels ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( blo@@ ws ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence Ab@@ dom@@ en ( pun@@ ched belly ) , as well as su@@ sten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with et@@ wa@@ iger over@@ sensitivity , vitamin D@@ 3 , or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit at least 30 minutes . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or use of drugs ( including ant@@ acid , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and Vit@@ amin@@ supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following critics are exactly to be followed in order to reduce the risk of ös@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be lu@@ red after the advent of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ ynge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;

&quot; Ö@@ soph@@ age@@ al reactions , such as O@@ soph@@ agi@@ i , ös@@ age@@ age@@ al Ul@@ sm@@ a and ös@@ age@@ age@@ al stri@@ pes , were rarely followed by in@@ ag@@ ron@@ y@@ al stri@@ des ( partly these severe and required a nurse ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor is therefore deliber@@ ate attention to all signs and symptoms that are advised to be advised on possible det@@ ach@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain while stro@@ lling or retro@@ ster@@ n@@ ale pain , or new or so@@ lim@@ mer@@ n@@ ment so@@ d@@ burn the medicine to retri@@ eve and medical advice ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of he@@ avier side @-@ side effects seems to be increased in patients , which does not take the medicine correctly and / or it after the appearance of symptoms that may take effect on a det@@ ach@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all the tut@@ ors are passed on to patients and to be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large angel@@ ic clinical studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no higher risk was established , rare ( following the launch ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some serious and associated with complications , reported ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy nor of nursing women .

&quot; the efficacy of the efficacy was the number of patients with which the transpl@@ ant was forced after a treatment period of one year ( by looking for example , how often a renewed organ transpl@@ ant or a revival of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) . &quot;
further studies were conducted more trials of 119 patients with kidney transpl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ ant and examined how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is recorded compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transpl@@ ant patients should apply this medicine or make changes in the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transpl@@ ant@@ ations or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ immune @-@ repression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; revers@@ al of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the narro@@ wer control of one in the transpl@@ ant supervision of a physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic medicines must be carried out in order to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of sampling and compatibility in individual case , and for blood@@ stream . see below &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ d@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ als should be controlled after the conversion and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; 4 was the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a talent , with both form@@ ulations both at kidney and liver @-@ er@@ ased patients . &quot;
careful and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talent levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure to immediate tran@@ splan@@ tion phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with lower clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has been reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient is not permitted in the first post@@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentr@@ ations on the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of approx . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the application of the supp@@ ression of the transpl@@ ant power must be maintained , consequently , a maximum duration of the oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
Dos@@ age recommendations - kidney intake of transpl@@ ac@@ ul@@ sions The or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further Dos@@ is@@ ations can be required later , as the phar@@ ma ine@@ tics can change from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transpl@@ antation . &quot;
Dos@@ age recommendations - liver transpl@@ ant Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
dosage Recommen@@ dation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted to a transpl@@ ant@@ at@@ ei@@ vers of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f so that this shift in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to take place on the entire daily dose .
Ni@@ er@@ - and liver transpl@@ ant after a switch from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once daily needs to begin treatment with the liver transpl@@ ant initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant@@ ries .
&quot; heart transpl@@ ant For adult patients who will be re@@ acted on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , is an or@@ ale initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.15 mg / kg / day daily in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transc@@ end@@ ant@@ at@@ ei@@ vers is no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in pul@@ mon@@ ary , p@@ ank@@ ings , and col@@ on ob@@ struc@@ tive patients in an or@@ derly initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 2@@ mg / kg / day and in bo@@ iler initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day for use . &quot;
&quot; Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in special patient @-@ groups patients with reduced liver function Z@@ ur maintaining cons@@ angu@@ age can be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction , a reduction of the dose may be required . &quot;
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not affect the phar@@ ma ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a me@@ tic@@ ulous monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um Cre@@ at@@ ine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ incl@@ ination and a monitoring of ur@@ inary tract ) is recommended . &quot;
switch from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f With the conversion from a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ no - on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; recommendations on the valley mirror in full @-@ blood , the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual case under ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ming of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tactics and ob@@ struc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant operation , followed by peri@@ odi@@ c controls during the exploration therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood levels from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes to immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in simultaneous application of substances , which might change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whol@@ ec@@ centric ble@@ eding ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical studies can be realized that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the levels of levels in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml can not exceed . &quot;
in clinical practice the talent levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually occurs in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with nom@@ inate - and sav@@ ag@@ ated patients with 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent replacement therapy of liver , kidney and heart transpl@@ ant@@ at@@ recei@@ vers were generally used blood @-@ concentr@@ ations in the area of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this led to serious undes@@ irable events , including tran@@ splan@@ ts or other side effects , which may occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; relocation of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the narro@@ wer control of one in the transpl@@ ant supervision of a physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with a transpl@@ ant rep@@ ent@@ ment which proved to be proven to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants and are not yet clinical data for re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
&quot; for prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant@@ at@@ shor@@ tw@@ ave receiver and tr@@ spl@@ itting recei@@ vers in child @-@ age , there are still no clinical data for re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to potential interactions signed in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) contain or other plant healing during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ tic concentration of concentr@@ ations in the blood is offered as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ble@@ aching in such circumstances can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under pro@@ gra@@ f there was a cardi@@ omy@@ opathy that distinguished Kam@@ mer@@ - or Sept@@ um@@ ary trop@@ hia , which therefore may also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clin@@ ician disorders , are an already existing heart suffering , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver functioning , infections , fluid @-@ over@@ load and oils . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted to the potential risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection by a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us take , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , changed consciousness levels , cr@@ amps and visual dys@@ functions should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. : ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f Hart@@ bl@@ ackl@@ es , re@@ tar@@ tends , L@@ act@@ ose , is carried out in patients with the rare her@@ edit@@ ary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , L@@ act@@ ase deficiency or gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ coloring . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of drugs or herbal remedies that are known as Hem@@ mer or indu@@ ction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels at the same gift of substances which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and to adapt the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equal concentr@@ ations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strong distinctive interaction was developed with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics , such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and Vor@@ icon@@ atri@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ lid of Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ prot@@ eas@@ bers ( z ) . &quot;
pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic studies reveal that the rise of blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the ventil@@ ation of gast@@ ro@@ ber@@ inal metabolism , results . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ si@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute ho@@ stages , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower . &quot;
&quot; effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ tic is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with drugs , which met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism is imp@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us deri@@ ve the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contr@@ az@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a and thus to increase hormonal im@@ position , is especially careful in decisions about recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animals have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will potentially reduce the clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and its half @-@ time span .
&quot; the results of a small number of investigations into transpl@@ ant patients do not provide an indication that under Tac@@ sm@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , an increased risk of unwanted events in terms of course and outcome of pregnancy . &quot;

Adv@@ ate will be used for the treatment and prevention of blood vessels in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one through the lack of factor VIII conditioned , inn@@ ate blood cl@@ ot disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application are based on whether Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment of ble@@ eding or preventing ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with H@@ hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack , which causes cl@@ utter@@ ances in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plas@@ ma but is produced according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell into which one gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is another in the European Union &apos;s approved medicines called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it will be different , so that medicines will not contain proteins or human origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate har@@ dam@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated with the prevention of blood vessels as well as in surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was awarded in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood @-@ sep@@ tic classes with &quot; excellent &quot; respectively . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess , head@@ aches , Py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate must not be applied in patients who may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse , or Ham@@ m or any other components . &quot;
March 2004 the European Commission nomin@@ ee the B@@ ax@@ ter AG appro@@ ve a permit for the transport of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
&quot; dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the sever@@ ing of the factor VIII , according to the place and extent of the ble@@ eding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
in the following hem@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII below is not set under the specified plastic level ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment will be eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk to the patient is over .
&quot; during treatment of treatment , the dosage and frequency of inj@@ ections becomes an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plastic con@@ es . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may be distinguished in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different semi @-@ effects . &quot;
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis of prophy@@ la@@ xis of prophy@@ la@@ xis with patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be doses between 20 and 40 is that factor VIII per kg body weight can be given by two @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII plastics cannot be achieved or when the blood circulation is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to prove a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor of VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be wo@@ efully . &quot;
&quot; the delivery speed should be directed after finding the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ ality antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII cluster G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plas@@ ma via modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ position stage is on the largest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in the treated patients ( P@@ TP@@ s ) with more than 100 ex@@ position and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ sch @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occur of ( low ti@@ tri@@ gen ) in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare advent of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women are concerned about the application of factor VIII , during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s largest number of patients in the patients were inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have experienced a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial on @-@ clear data , the CH@@ MP has further assessed the benefits @-@ risk assessment , but considering that the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the safety pro@@ filing of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the regulatory authorities should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited ( CH@@ MP ) officially distributed to the committee on Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company takes its application for authorisation from Adv@@ enti@@ st for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer .
&quot; however , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues that connects the other structures in the body , surrounds and rel@@ ies ) of it . &quot;
this is a type of virus that gene@@ tically modified in gene@@ tically so that there is a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ enti@@ st is a &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been so changed , that there can be no copies of themselves and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ oriz@@ ations could have jump@@ ed directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the not def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually carries to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , in which the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company put data from a study involving a patient at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the field of under@@ mining , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had the answers to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ explained . &quot;
&quot; based on the inspection of the initial documents , the CH@@ MP is created a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
according to the CH@@ MP was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ enti@@ st in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore offers benefits for the patient .
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration , as well as the security of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not been sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ enti@@ st can be produced in reliable ways and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the CH@@ MP did not inform the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ enti@@ st . &quot;
&quot; changing active ingredient means that the tablets are so mer@@ ged , that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other slowly is released over a few hours . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used for treating the symptoms of the seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis ( h@@ ay fever , by allergies to poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al @-@ nose @-@ swelling ( pet@@ op@@ ters nose ) . &quot;
in adults and young people aged 12 years the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is taken twice a tablet daily with a glass of water with or without food .
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al skin ( pet@@ op@@ ted nose ) . &quot;
a total treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
&quot; the main focus of the measurements were the changes of the sword of the h@@ ay fever , which were reported from the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the study , patients received their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and reviewed with a standard sk@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in view of all h@@ ay symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze took over a decrease of symptoms around 46,@@ 0 % , compared with 35.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al infection was seen , the patient showed a relief of symptoms by 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % in the patients , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate ( cardi@@ o lift ) , anti @-@ drying , head@@ aches , head@@ aches , redness , redness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , som@@ ni@@ ol@@ enz ( beats ) , sleeping disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be super@@ flu@@ ous ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine active substances or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is also not used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ len@@ angle glau@@ coma ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or have already caused a risk to an ugly stroke . &quot;
on 30 July 2007 the European Commission gave its authorisation for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to sw@@ allow it to the whole ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ush , break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to failure .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days , since long @-@ term application , the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease in time . &quot;
&quot; after decrease in the swelling of the s@@ wir@@ es in the upper respiratory system , the treatment could be continued when required with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; da Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the drug is also con@@ train@@ dicated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity with combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine like Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Er@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin or other Dek@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , phen@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient &apos;s patient and the data is not enough to speak appropriate recommendations on dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver @-@ functioning and the data is not enough to speak appropriate recommendations on dosage .
&quot; patients must be notified that treatment at the appearance of hyper@@ tension or a speed@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or of pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be put down . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment of following patients , patients suffering from patients - patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with cardi@@ ac disease , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to performing dermat@@ ological testing , since anti@@ hist@@ amine could prevent positive reactions to indicators on track transactions or reduce it in their scale . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered , however , were not observed any clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plas@@ ma @-@ concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences could be detected between the patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
the enzy@@ mes of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin activ@@ ist enzy@@ me has not yet identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are not hem@@ med and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
&quot; the infin@@ ity of the application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities when compared to the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ ical attributes of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases it may come to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to an impair@@ ment or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary from a T@@ NS depression ( se@@ per@@ ation , Ap@@ nea , coma , com@@ ic cardiovascular coll@@ aps ) and a Z@@ NS @-@ stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ al lob@@ es . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxi@@ ousness , anti @-@ oxid@@ ation , muscle weakness , cardi@@ ac disease , sav@@ ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , sav@@ ory , nau@@ sea , v@@ esti@@ al , t@@ spir@@ ation , t@@ tig@@ o , Tinnitus , at@@ ax@@ ie , ten@@ dons , and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ b @-@ stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , just like the dri@@ p @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , pe@@ on@@ th@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ un@@ al symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ k@@ inen such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 out of human cor@@ ps / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the inhi@@ bitions of the eag@@ er@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P @-@ Sel@@ ec@@ tin on End@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells . &quot;
&quot; at a single @-@ dose study with adults showed di@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective ges@@ ter@@ iness or the tasks connected with the flies . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials was found in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily with increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can give more sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis , whereby 4@@ 14 patients received aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall cor@@ es for the symptom ( except nas@@ al infection ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the degrad@@ ation effect , determined by the nas@@ al infection , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
within a single @-@ dose study on pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics from Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is di@@ lor@@ at@@ adin within 30 minutes after administration in plas@@ ma veri@@ fiable .

&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ test study , which was performed with the wor@@ ding as a tablet by healthy adult prob@@ es , has been identified that four Pro@@ b@@ anden Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was badly affected . &quot;
a component study study reveals that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ equivalent was the exposure to g@@ out of a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , the toxic@@ ity at repeated gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and to the reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin however can not recognise the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
the combination poss@@ essed no greater toxic@@ ity as its individual components and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with the or@@ als in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and at rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day is not ter@@ at@@ ogenic .

A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies in seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis and two studies involving patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by creating the variation of the symptoms ( it@@ ch , number and size of squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and the performance on the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body decreases the sy@@ rup , the solution to the entry and the mel@@ ting jack@@ ets in the same way consider how the tablets and the application in children are harmless . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , if the results of all studies have been summar@@ ised , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us became an average score of 12 to 32 % , compared to the acceptance of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the acceptance of the symptom according to six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % with plac@@ ebo &apos;s patients . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components . &quot;
January 2001 shared the European Commission for appro@@ vals from A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union .
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ sti@@ tizing and pers@@ ist allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness of the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in young people aged 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ fer@@ til@@ ted rhin@@ i@@ tis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be subject to the previous path@@ ologies and can end after the end of the symptoms and may be resum@@ ed at their re @-@ appear again .
&quot; with the Persian allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the aller@@ po@@ uring time . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been detected as part of clin@@ ician studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets in addition to which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , at simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol is not reinforced the performance of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases it can come to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to an impair@@ ment or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic jud@@ tics , were reported at recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects which was reported more frequently than when plac@@ ebo was reported , fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0,8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 578 y@@ outh@@ ful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ effect head@@ aches were treated with 5,@@ 9 % of the patients which were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and treated with 6.6 % of the patients which were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ multi study study , administ@@ ered by up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ times a clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ k@@ inen such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 out of human cor@@ ps / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the inhi@@ bitions of the eag@@ er@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P @-@ Sel@@ ec@@ tin on End@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multi @-@ professional , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was administ@@ ered in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statistical or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular impact was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administ@@ ered over ten days , showed itself not an extension of the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults showed di@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective ges@@ ter@@ iness or the tasks that are connected to the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ch , lac@@ ri@@ mal and redness of eyes , as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and pers@@ ist rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
the allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown by the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aires for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ economic ti@@ vi@@ tis , dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us effectively which by seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis caused by seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
the chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was acting out for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria as the underlying path@@ physiological analysis in the differ@@ ing forms similar to the differ@@ ing forms and chron@@ ical patients can be easier pro@@ spec@@ tively .
&quot; since the pri@@ amin@@ release is an obvious factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular disorders , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin besides the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic jud@@ tics will also result in other forms of pri@@ tik@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effectively in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first Dos@@ is@@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic jud@@ tics , the minority of patients who were not out of anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka re@@ acted from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the it@@ ch to more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and growing , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients @-@ demo@@ s were comparable with the general seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis population , was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no cl@@ ue to clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , the enzy@@ mes of the met@@ abolic enzy@@ mes enzy@@ mes not yet identified , so that interaction with other drugs cannot be ruled out completely . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not im@@ pe@@ de and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7.5 mg more meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie breakfast ) does not depend on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the clinical trials carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin performed by a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and by Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity let the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin no particular risks to humans . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ sti@@ tizing and pers@@ ist allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the prescri@@ bers should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ i@@ tis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data lie ahead , which support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ eri@@ us . &quot;
&quot; apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ alies should play a role in diagnosis , physical studies and appropriate lab and skin examination . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years have met@@ aboli@@ zed des@@ o@@ adin and experienced a higher sub@@ stan@@ cy ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ ups in children between 2 and 11 years , limited met@@ abolic costs , is identical with the children who have yet met@@ abolic . &quot;
this medicine contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not use inherited problems of an fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ absorption or an Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been detected as part of clin@@ ician studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in addition to which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , during simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the performance effects of alcohol is not enhanced ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ ups group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and young people in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ medical study , in adults and juven@@ iles , administ@@ ered by up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ et@@ times a clinical dose ) were not observed clin@@ ically relevant effects . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years old , have received a daily dis@@ sol@@ itary therapy for 1,25 mg ( between the ages of 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between the ages of 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
because the course of allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis / chronic idi@@ opathic jud@@ tics and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar to the drug data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults on the children &apos;s population .
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multi @-@ specialist in adults and juven@@ iles , which was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily using 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular impact was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study involving adults and juven@@ iles , in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , showed itself not an extension of the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials was established in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and teenagers . no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; at a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets carried out in clinical trials at no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies , it was caused by the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to rein@@ forcement of alcohol in@@ duced performance , nor to an increase in combination . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ch , lac@@ ri@@ mal and redness of eyes , as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as on the basis of the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aires for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ economic rhin@@ i@@ tis was shown , dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively which by seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis performed by seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;

&quot; spreading this limited met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than by Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ domain multi @-@ medical study with the si@@ r@@ ative rhin@@ i@@ tis in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , which is restricted to metabol@@ ise . &quot;
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was approximately 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a tempor@@ al semi @-@ time period of about 120 hours .
there are no cl@@ ue to a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient to once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and juven@@ iles .
&quot; 12 In various single @-@ dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin @-@ sy@@ rup in an dosage of 5 mg . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. on the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) officially with that the company takes its application for authorisation from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ In@@ flu@@ enza in adults and older people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against flu , caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the In@@ flu@@ enza A @-@ virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine , which could cause before a trunk of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out if a new tribe of the flu virus emerg@@ es , which can easily spread from man to person , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; according to the vaccines the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system contained in the vaccine included parts of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; &quot; and constitutes antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , the immune system later is able to form a contact with a grip @-@ virus from this pedi@@ ms to form faster antibodies . &quot;
subsequently the membrane ke@@ epers of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that recogni@@ zes the human body as body @-@ foreign ) and as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; a inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not performed in accordance with the &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
this enables the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine for the evaluation of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vaccines .
&quot; if you are participating in a clinical examination and need further information on your treatment , please contact your physician physician . &quot;
&quot; if you wish for further information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , with the human immune @-@ weak@@ ening of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the wor@@ ding immun@@ weak@@ ening syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can &apos;t sw@@ allow the capsules , A@@ generic can be taken as a solution to use , but this cannot be investigated along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic should only be en@@ acted when the doctor has checked that the anti@@ viral medication has been previously taken , and the probability assessed that the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which is taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ meth@@ ase is aimed at body weight . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic drugs reduces intake in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs called HIV @-@ quantity in the blood , and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS does not cure AIDS , however , may delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of with AIDS associated infections and illnesses . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic drugs has been used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , had been studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adult , previously did not have been treated with prot@@ eas@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; this with low do@@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicines A@@ generic was taken in 206 adults , which had previously taken prot@@ eas@@ ants , with other prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with not veri@@ fiable concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in the virus as after the treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients who previously did not have a prot@@ eas@@ ant previously , after 48 weeks of A@@ generic more patients had a viral last below 400 copies / ml as below plac@@ ebo , but A@@ generic was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with children decreased a@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the viral last but with the children who were treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ants , only very few in the treatment languages . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , which had been treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ants , that with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicines A@@ generic medicines after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ ants : &quot;
&quot; in the patients suffering with HIV , which was against four other prot@@ eas@@ ants @-@ resistant to four weeks , it came together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste from the Virginia @-@ last after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous protests : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ generic ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( Bl@@ u@@ ity ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and Ill@@ nesses ( ti@@ redness ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase should not be applied in patients who may be super@@ flu@@ ous ( allergic ) against am@@ en@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; A@@ generic may also not be applied in patients , the cur@@ rants ( a herbal supplement to treat depression ) or medicines which are just as old as A@@ generic drugs , and in high concentr@@ ations in the blood of health are harmful . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , for patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( with@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ ologist syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection , caused by changing the immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) approved the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ generic drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat patients with prot@@ ru@@ denti@@ als previously untreated HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; a@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee included that the benefits of a generic abo@@ o in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have a prot@@ eas@@ ant previously . &quot;
&quot; generic A@@ generic was originally used under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission was distributed to the G@@ lax@@ o Group as a permit for rel@@ easing nuclear recovery in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ generic medicines is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- , prot@@ eas@@ ants ( PI ) for adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ generic capsules are supposed to be administ@@ ered for pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ze along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ en@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral pesti@@ cides and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to use is less than am@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution for entry on a milli@@ gram is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg Am@@ bur@@ b@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generic capsules are used without the ampli@@ fication supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses must be applied to a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicinal drugs up to a daily standard dose of 2400 mg Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants have not been studied in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data to infin@@ ity and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ meth@@ ase capsules in adult patients with mid @-@ heavy liver functioning on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver functioning on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
simultaneous application is intended for patients with mild or moderate liver @-@ functioning with caution , in patients with severe living @-@ functioning , it is con@@ train@@ dicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; a@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with drugs , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; herbal supplements , the cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may include , may not be applied due to risk of reduced plas@@ mac@@ euticals and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ en@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ ber ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be advised that as@@ phy@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can also develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with leu@@ cine does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually A@@ generic capsules are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C and have been treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver impacts with potentially deadly disease .
for the event of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please refer to the relevant specialized information on this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including a chron@@ ically @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver functioning under a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of a@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on or other gl@@ uc@@ ose id , which is not recommended over CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , unless that the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ne@@ ster@@ oid from the effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and soup of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin strongly influenced by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is a simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opathic including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen is not recommended .
&quot; 4 For some medicines may cause serious or life @-@ threatening medical @-@ effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants , and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised Rati@@ o ) , are available methods for determining the molecular concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking these medicines at the same time , can be less effective due to decreased plas@@ mas@@ b@@ tion by Am@@ bur@@ b@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with am@@ en@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal counter@@ act can be changed , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ bur@@ ner , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity of a toxic@@ ity , due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col in the A@@ fr@@ ase solution for children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic should be set on duration 5 if a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the vei@@ ls are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ants , has been reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an extrac@@ ting of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other illnesses to their treatment medicines which are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the related met@@ abolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; at h@@ lu@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which have been treated with prot@@ eas@@ bers , reports have been reported on an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous k@@ ut@@ aner ha@@ emat@@ ome and hem@@ thro@@ pods . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective could develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to serious clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi @-@ fac@@ t@@ orial Equ@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol intake , heavy immun@@ ology , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , have reported cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Sub@@ str@@ ates with lower therapeutic width A@@ generic may not be given simultaneously with drugs , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with little therap@@ eutical width A@@ generic with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with drugs , whose active ingredients are mainly affected by CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with gra@@ vely and / or life @-@ threatening unwanted effects . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ en@@ avi@@ r that may lead to a vi@@ ro@@ rolog@@ ical suspic@@ ion and lead to a residential development .
&quot; in trying to compens@@ ate the lowest plas@@ mas@@ cot , by a dosage increase of other proteins inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently observed unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ mirror of am@@ en@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient takes already cur@@ rants , the am@@ bur@@ st mirror and , if possible to check the Virginia @-@ last and to reset the cur@@ rants . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the drug is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered together with am@@ bur@@ b@@ av@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence below ) .
5@@ 08 % increase , for C@@ max on it at 30 % lower , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered . &quot;
in clinical trials dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ en@@ avi@@ r has been applied twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day that occupy the effectiveness and imm@@ uni@@ formity of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower when Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
&quot; the C@@ min @-@ values of am@@ en@@ avi@@ r in plas@@ ma , which were achieved in the combination of am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a met@@ ering recommendations for simultaneous administration of am@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended to a narrow surveillance , as the effectiveness and integrity of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; it was not carried out a pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic study to the use of A@@ generic in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however is recommended due to the ant@@ ac@@ ro component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ generic ase should be at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acid below ) . &quot;
therefore with gift from E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment required .
the treatment with adul@@ ter@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be low .
the effect of ne@@ ph@@ ap@@ in to other proteins and available limited data can susp@@ ect that ne@@ ph@@ ap@@ in the ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation by Am@@ av@@ avi@@ r could possibly lo@@ wers .
&quot; if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advisable as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ mas@@ ons could be less effective . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logic supervision should be made , as an exact memory of the effect of combination of am@@ bur@@ b@@ av@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of am@@ av@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to 193 % and thus to a rise in with a so@@ fab@@ u@@ tin side effects .
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase is at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic studies with a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out but could be the plas@@ mas@@ hing of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eg@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plas@@ ma at 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ side ) has been observed a bit compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous application by Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or indu@@ ction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ meth@@ ase , possibly cause interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be associated with toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs when they are applied in combination with A@@ meth@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other proteins , it is advisable that ant@@ acid can not be taken at the same time as a@@ gener@@ ase , since it can come to res@@ or@@ p@@ tive disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ on@@ vul@@ si@@ va , which are known as an enzy@@ me ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ en@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degrad@@ ation of the plas@@ mas@@ quar@@ ry of Am@@ av@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium limbs , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ gh@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ bur@@ st , thereby causing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous intake with as@@ generic can increase significantly and increase PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with side effects , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ mal daily ) over 7 days of trial , while the endo@@ gen@@ ous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ generic with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless that the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of system@@ ic @-@ cor@@ ne@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinctive enh@@ ancements of plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ es at simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ke increases in this H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , is not recommended to use this medicine with am@@ bur@@ b@@ av@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations as far as the stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plas@@ mak@@ eover of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ id@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be raised at simultaneous gift of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; hence , A@@ generic is not used together with or@@ bit@@ ing Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at simultaneous application of A@@ generic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are advisable . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ed@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ons from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administ@@ ered together with am@@ bur@@ b@@ ang , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the per se low rem@@ uner@@ ation of historical compar@@ isons , currently no recommendation are given , as am@@ bur@@ b@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time , if Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
in simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ generic rati@@ os for the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional appointments by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal dou@@ bl@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a is not fores@@ ee@@ able so it is also recommended alternative methods to treat contrac@@ eption .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous gift from A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .

the intoler@@ ance of a@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most associated with the A@@ generic treatment associated side effects were easily down to moderate , performed early on and rarely led to treatment . &quot;
many of these events has not been clari@@ fied if they are used in connection with the intake of a@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV treatment of drugs or whether they are a result of the cruel disease .
&quot; most of the below side effects originate from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) where the patients received from 1200 mg A@@ generic patients received from 1200 mg A@@ generic patients . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were valued by the investig@@ ator as related to the study media , and more than 1 % of the patients were performed , as well as under the treatment trial ( degrees 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy has been associated with an re@@ distribution of the body @-@ functions ( li@@ cular D@@ ystro@@ phy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fast sub@@ skin tissue , multip@@ lic@@ as and vis@@ cer@@ al tissues , hyper@@ trop@@ y of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal li@@ pos@@ al collection ( Sti@@ eler ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 , retro@@ sp@@ ying not previously treated people who were treated with am@@ ot@@ v@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ din over a medium run of 36 weeks , was only observed a case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;

the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ak@@ ut cells and amounts to 2 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells

in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ sp@@ ally non @-@ treat@@ able patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages have been observed with prot@@ eas@@ e@@ avi@@ osis - the described mut@@ ations only rarely observed .

on gender @-@ based analyses Gen@@ otyp@@ ical Inter@@ pret@@ ation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ants @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines res@@ ili@@ ence as the presence of the mut@@ ations L@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 54@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a increased ph@@ onic res@@ ili@@ ence ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always proceed to the current interpre@@ tations systems for the analysis of the results of pesti@@ cides . &quot;
&quot; based on ph@@ onic resistance @-@ based analyses , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated analysis systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for the dis@@ ation of the activity of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ants @-@ resistant insul@@ ates . &quot;
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ ph@@ onic Cut @-@ off@@ s ( crossover points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV to be applied to the interpretation of results of a Resi@@ denti@@ al testing .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ ber viol@@ ated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistant to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which remains sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r however remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r and other proteins , for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r residen@@ ces , either on its own or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ sp@@ las@@ ers not previously untreated patients with a Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ bur@@ b@@ ber@@ r maintains its activity against some other proteins @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insulation . &quot;
the early departure of a reconc@@ iled therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders which may affect the following treatment .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of generic drugs in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 300 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cl@@ e@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( NR@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with a lowest chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; 100 @-@ 100@@ sixty @-@ six ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ generic , at least another PI and at least a NR@@ TI were included in the study study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub@@ contracting of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI @-@ group in view of the period @-@ ad@@ ign@@ ed amendment of the output level ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plas@@ ma ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in plas@@ ma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ recur@@ ring threshold of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the evidence of effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led a@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controll@@ able studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generic solution has been used in doses and capsules in doses from 15 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of those with PI pre @-@ treated patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study conducted a plas@@ ma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA @-@ concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml at a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell speed of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Basi@@ lic@@ ating to this data should be considered in therapy optim@@ isation , with PI pre @-@ treated children , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered together with Am@@ bur@@ b@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ en@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ bur@@ b@@ av@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; hence , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained in@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous intake of the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption is influenced . &quot;
the seem@@ ing volume volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be reached on a large part of distribution as well as an enormous penetration of am@@ ber cycles out of the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in total concentration of the drug in plas@@ ma , with the amount of un@@ broken am@@ bur@@ st , which represents the active share , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ broken am@@ bur@@ ner remains constant , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active component in dependence on the overall drug control in the Ste@@ ady state over the area of C@@ max , ss until C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; hence , medicines , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bits or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution , if they are given simultaneously with apple ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg times per day , leads to a similar daily am@@ bur@@ st exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ av@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ s than from the capsules , hence , A@@ generic solution and a@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not changeable on a milli@@ gram &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected , therefore , the effect of a kidney disease can be slight on the eli@@ mination of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ke comparable to those that have been achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ bur@@ b@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for c@@ ann@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity to mice and rats appeared in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ osph@@ ere aden@@ oma at dos@@ ages , which corresponds to the 2,@@ 0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - DOU@@ BLE ( rat ) of exposure to 1200 mg Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r , entsp@@ ils . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ cell aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma still has not been elu@@ ci@@ fied and the relevance of this observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; of the present ex@@ posi@@ tional data on people , both from clinical studies as well as from therapeutic use , however , took little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity testing , the bacterial test of rats testing , micro@@ kernel test on rats and Chro@@ mos@@ omen@@ cr@@ acks were included in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ id@@ avi@@ r neither cri@@ tically nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored in clinical everyday life by measuring A@@ ST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; hitherto in clinical studies no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed , either during the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase or after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity with juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mor@@ t@@ ality with both the control and am@@ bur@@ ri@@ val animals . &quot;
&quot; in a system@@ ic Plas@@ ma@@ ex@@ position , which was significant ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected expos@@ ures in therapeutic dosage , however , were observed a number of low changes including thy@@ ro@@ g@@ ong@@ ation and low @-@ feet skel@@ eton , which point to a consumed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generic capsules are used without the ampli@@ fiers of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses must be applied to a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicinal drugs up to a daily standard dose of 2400 mg Am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous application is intended for patients with more fra@@ ying or lighter liver @-@ functioning with caution , in patients with severe living @-@ functioning , it is con@@ train@@ dicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines may cause serious or life @-@ threatening medical @-@ effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants , and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised Rati@@ o ) , are available methods for determining the molecular concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic should be set on duration 27 , if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the vei@@ ls are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; higher risk of a li@@ ke@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as a higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the related met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ en@@ avi@@ r that may lead to a vi@@ ro@@ rolog@@ ical suspic@@ ion and lead to a residential development .
5@@ 08 % increase , for C@@ max on it at 30 % lower , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min @-@ values of am@@ en@@ avi@@ r in plas@@ ma , which were achieved in the combination of am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a met@@ ering recommendations for simultaneous administration of am@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended to a narrow surveillance , as the effectiveness and integrity of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with adul@@ ter@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with am@@ bur@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be low .
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logic supervision should be made , as an exact memory of the effect of combination of am@@ bur@@ b@@ av@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ meth@@ ase is to be processed in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium limbs , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ gh@@ pin , ni@@ gh@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by am@@ bur@@ gs , thereby causing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ mal daily ) over 7 days of trial , while the endo@@ gen@@ ous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
in simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ generic rati@@ os for the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ es@@ tradi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to an decrease of the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ bur@@ b@@ dr@@ on by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug is allowed to use only after careful ab@@ om@@ iting of possible utility for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
a reproduction study on impair@@ ment which was administ@@ ered by the dis@@ armament to the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding of am@@ bur@@ b@@ ang showed during the lac@@ tation period of a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in dec@@ eler@@ ation .
the intoler@@ ance of a@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is opposed to signs of an infection ( see Section 4.8 ) , if necessary , are necessary ass@@ ass@@ ent measures to be accepted . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity by Am@@ av@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in ak@@ ut and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ bic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral and lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ak@@ ut cells and amounts to 2.0 µ@@ g in chronic cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ bur@@ b@@ ber@@ r maintains its activity against some other proteins @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insulation . &quot;
&quot; based on these data should be considered in therapy optim@@ isation , with PI pre @-@ treated children the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ broken am@@ bur@@ ner remains constant , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active component in dependence on the overall drug control in the Ste@@ ady state over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; hence , medicines , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bits or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution , if they are given simultaneously with apple ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;

&quot; however , from the present ex@@ posi@@ tional data on people , both from clinical studies as well as from therapeutic use , however , there is little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity testing , the bacterial test of rats testing , micro@@ kernel test on rats and Chro@@ mos@@ omen@@ urs@@ ement included in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ id@@ avi@@ r neither cri@@ tically nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity with juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mor@@ t@@ ality with both the control and am@@ bur@@ ri@@ val animals . &quot;

the bio@@ availability of am@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to use is less than am@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution for entry on a milli@@ gram is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; patients should be able to sw@@ allow the capsules , to sw@@ allow the capsules with the in@@ ges@@ ting of the solution to the one ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; the application area and the duration of treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the treating disease : • At home in a maximum of 16 weeks of times . • At small bas@@ al cell cycles , it is weekly during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks &apos; break between the treatment cycles , three times weekly . &quot;
the cream is th@@ inner before bed@@ time th@@ et@@ ted on the affected skin surfaces so that they remain sufficient for a long time ( about eight hours ) on the skin before they washed away .
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four major studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete deportation of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell cancer patients with small bas@@ al cell cancer and plac@@ ebo or plac@@ ebo either daily or five times weekly .

a full precip@@ itation could be reached at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od during five @-@ minute use per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the audi@@ ts were hist@@ ological confirmed single primary super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell spon@@ ge with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years now show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured , and that were also 48 months long . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od during three week @-@ week application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week @-@ treated period , was investigated in two double blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ul@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic AK@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within one @-@ related 25 c@@ m2 big treatment area than on the sc@@ arf of sc@@ alp or in the face . &quot;
the recording data from two com@@ inated monitoring studies show a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications of external control , ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell , usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients in general and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dara Cre@@ me was investigated in four random@@ ized , double blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od could not be shown in these studies there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks b@@ z@@ w .
a minimum system@@ ic absorption of 5 % of the I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ am by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest level of medicines in Ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and praying 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ time period was roughly 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hours @-@ time period following sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this indicates a prolonged re@@ ten@@ tion of the medicine in the skin .
&quot; the data for the system@@ ic expos@@ ures showed that the remains of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od after top@@ ical application from patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fic@@ i@@ fic@@ i@@ ac disease . &quot;

a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with mice in three days a week in@@ duced no tum@@ ors at the application point .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is unknown , but since I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od only possesses a small system@@ ic absorption from human skin and not mut@@ ations , is a risk to the person due to the system@@ ic exposure as very low . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was examined , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by testing its effect on the reduction of the grid concentr@@ ations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five lo@@ wered Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine is about 60 % , and half of the children treated at the end of the study a normal big liver . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , abdom@@ inal pain , pain @-@ pain , pain @-@ pain , pain @-@ pain , pain @-@ pain , pain , pain , pain , fever , pain , and reactions to the inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , Tach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be strongly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not applied . &quot;
&quot; the European drugs agency ( E@@ MEA ) is available every year on all new information that may be known , check and update this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , with regard to the reactions to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
June 2003 the European Commission commissioned the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe BV . a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cell@@ ul@@ en ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is to treat patients with secure diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ out@@ let I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should take place by a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 e / kg / h can , if the patient takes this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients cannot be a Do@@ ge scheme .
safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not identified and for these patients cannot be a met@@ ering scheme .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients , patients may develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as each in the related effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion time ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason especially these patients should continue to be monitored , and the inf@@ usion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , where re @-@ care institutions should be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , we expect nearly all patients Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution in applying al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; because there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , needs to be cau@@ tious due to the theoretical risk of over@@ sensitive risks after a break in treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the beginning of the inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ p@@ ies ) to minimize the potential infection @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of a slight or moderate inf@@ usion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion reaction the inf@@ usion has to be stopped until the symptoms are taken to decrease , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and acet@@ amin@@ am@@ ol / is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considering . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate involving the reaction occurred .
3 are used ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ yl@@ am@@ ol / is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate which occurred in response .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular recording of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there were no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended to satisfy during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
the side effects in clinical trials were arranged mainly as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions to be observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; unwanted medication transactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3@@ - study and its extension to a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequent ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ borne participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe responses appeared , including Bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial expression ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children im@@ partial pharmaceutical effects in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under the age of 5 , with greater severe dis@@ continued and a total treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg of intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; for most patients , during the age of 5 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ic version , the patients aged between 5 and older patients were compared to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ical version ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days with patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase @-@ 3 study ( or until a premature departure from the study ) , at 13 / 45 patients were not obtained through radio immun@@ om@@ in@@ tra@@ itation ( Rip ) As@@ say rec@@ tion@@ able antibodies against which it never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
patients suffering from low anti@@ body levels have been a robust reduction in the gun powder in the har@@ n while in patients with high antibodies a variable decrease of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase @-@ 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal to low neutral inhibit@@ or activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to not affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of unwanted medicines and typically when the occurrence of unwanted drug interactions typically coinci@@ de with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies .
the reason@@ ing for the enzy@@ me therapy is in one for the hydro@@ lys@@ ses of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ate and preventing an additional accumulation of adequate restoration of the enzy@@ me .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken out of cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were investigated in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of the disease spectrum was indic@@ ted , the majority of the patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient pointed the serious phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients have been recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ zed exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
primary outcomes for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute en@@ et@@ rack in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ - hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients with the plac@@ ebo group , an improvement in the lung function and the capacity to be displayed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in an open extension study , an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as deri@@ ving from the following table . &quot;
the decrease of the percentage of FE@@ V is not significant over this period clin@@ ically and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with a hep@@ at@@ alie , in front of the treatment of 22 ( 85 % ) by the end of the study a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste from the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was fixed , which remained constant until the degree of study constant . &quot;
&quot; regarding the heter@@ ogen@@ ous prevalence of disease between patients , which sums into account by using a combined end@@ point ( or expected percentage point for five patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; a one @-@ year @-@ year open phase @-@ 2 study was conducted in which primarily the safety and pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was evaluated in 20 patients , which at the time of their inclusion in the study was under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe dis@@ continued form and 4 with the medium run form ) . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased for increased G@@ AG@@ - Spiegel in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; with several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( s = 3 ) found after the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle run @-@ form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) , and all 4 patients with the middle run @-@ form , whereas in the older patients with severe dis@@ continued development , there were only limited or even no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ ors schem@@ ata at the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute tests were performed . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg of intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the met@@ ering scheme with 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can present in patients , the difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , a mere read@@ able alternative ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two met@@ ering schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients aged five years was similar to the patients with older and less affected patients .

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is applied along with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( a different drug against cancer ) in patients who have not removed drugs ( drugs against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer ) has already spread to other parts of the body , or spreads to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is treated in patients who have not been treated previously , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy as agents . &quot;
to reduce side effects should be obtained during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a Corti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections from vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta administ@@ ered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin should be given prior to or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; ( drug against v@@ om@@ iting ) and flu@@ ids ( to remedy a fluid angel ) .
&quot; in patients , their blood image changed or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be decreased , decreased or the dose may be decreased . &quot;
the active form of pu@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed slo@@ ws the formation of DNA and RNA and prevent the cells divide .
&quot; the transformation of pu@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes more mild in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of the drug and a longer run@@ time in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ite Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study to 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in treating non @-@ cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta also was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , and both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study involving 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously did not have chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin survived by average 12,@@ 1 months , compared to 9,@@ 3 months in the all @-@ made administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received a chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared with 7.3 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies , however , in which cancer do not attack the turn@@ table cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival rates than with the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
September 2004 shared the European Commission to the Company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Ne@@ derland B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each flow bottle must be raised with 4.@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % of so@@ dium chlor@@ ic resolution ( 9 mg / ml ) - which yiel@@ ds a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from the entry bottle and with 0.@@ 9 % of so@@ dium @-@ injection @-@ injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml more dil@@ uted ( see section 6.6 ) .
al@@ M@@ TA is used in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ cl@@ onal bron@@ chi@@ al epith@@ eli@@ al epith@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
al@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in two @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ af metastatic color@@ ectal cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administ@@ ered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ cl@@ utter bron@@ chi@@ al cardi@@ ac disease , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administ@@ ered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of Hau@@ tre@@ reactions , the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as in the day after the treatment a cor@@ ne@@ ster@@ oid are given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose , P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 cans of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must continue throughout the whole therapy , as well as for further 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also obtain an in@@ tra @-@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dosage as well as after each third party cycle .
&quot; in case of patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be created before each gift , a complete blood image was created , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ ism . &quot;
the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( A@@ ST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment @-@ cycle a dosage @-@ examination must take place under min@@ kl@@ ess of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predic@@ table therapeutic cycles .
&quot; according to recovery , patients must be treated according to indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Com@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) &gt; C@@ TC @-@ 2 ble@@ eding .
&quot; if patients should not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity &gt; grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted by ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient is the value before treatment &quot;
&quot; the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA has to be broken when in patients after 2 dos@@ ages , a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continued by the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
clinical studies no indication that in patients aged 65 year@@ s- or compared to patients aged 65 years of age has increased risk @-@ risk assessment .
al@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to un@@ sufficient data for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
in clinical trials were necessary in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of &gt; &gt; 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary that go beyond for all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
the data base in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver @-@ functional need of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ times of the upper cor@@ ru@@ bin@@ der and / or tran@@ sp@@ ection values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 times of the upper limit ( in cases of liver metastatic ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 times of the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metastatic ) not specifically into studies . &quot;
patients must be super@@ vised with regard to the Kno@@ wing sou@@ ps and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ en@@ count is again a value of &gt; &gt; 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic @-@ enzy@@ mes has reg@@ ained a value of over 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ o number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of the grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ respiratory toxic@@ ity such as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie has been be@@ o- when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients must be instruc@@ ted to proceed with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ lac@@ tic measure for reduction , toxic@@ ity , ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ drug in@@ ster@@ oids ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is provided , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events appear , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant hydr@@ ation - collection in trans@@ cellular space a dra@@ inage of the result in front of the pro@@ filing treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal attack , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed foods when this substance is usually administ@@ ered in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ odi@@ cal substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application atten@@ u@@ ated vol@@ ati@@ le materials ( except yellow @-@ fever , this vaccine is con@@ train@@ dicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irrever@@ sible sk@@ ull of reproductive capacity is made by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out of treatment - g@@ inn to obtain advice on sperm activation . &quot;
in case of patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) can cause high doses non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ate acid in high dosage ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) to a decreased p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ou@@ tr@@ ance with the consequence of a multip@@ lication of side effects .
therefore caution is advisable if in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ics are used in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data concerning the action potential to be considered with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long semi @-@ prolon@@ gs such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application needs to be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the ger@@ line status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised Rati@@ o ) if the decision was made to treat the patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of pu@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed during pregnancy , but like with an@@ de@@ - An@@ tim@@ esp@@ ol@@ ites are expected to take heavy birth defects during an application in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessarily - challenging and careful clear@@ ing of the farm for both the mother and the risk of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irrever@@ sible impair@@ ment of reproductive capacity is made by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment of therapy , advice on the blocking of preser@@ v@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; it is not known as P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into the mother &apos;s milk , and unwanted effects in the embro@@ i@@ ded inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of unwanted effects which were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om and , and the random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ ine , and 163 patients received with Mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , who were random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

&quot; the primary analysis of this study was conducted during the population of all patients , which were obtained in the treatment of treatment ( random@@ ized and treated ) . &quot;
&quot; a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ite Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pl@@ a- T@@ in @-@ Arm ( 218 patients ) . &quot;
the differences between the two treatment arms is characterized by improvement of lung @-@ grade parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm and an entic@@ ity of lung function during time in control .

it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of &gt; &gt; 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie diet applied .
patients who are allowed to take in All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should turn to their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; these enzy@@ mes are inhi@@ bited , they can not dismant@@ le some fats in food , thus reducing about a quarter of associated fats in@@ duced the intest@@ ine . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the two studies involving patients with a BMI of &gt; 28 kg / m2 , patients who recorded 60 mg , after a year to record an average weight loss of 4,@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg at intake of plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , there could be no loss of the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss . &quot;

it must not be used in patients who are treated with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the organ of transpl@@ ant patients ) or by pharmaceuticals such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ auses .
it must not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term Mal@@ absorbed syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are taken from the diges@@ tive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver illness ) or in pregnant or nursing mothers .
July 2007 the European Commission began to appro@@ ve G@@ lax@@ o Group as a permit for the transport of Or@@ li@@ stat G@@ SK to the entire European Union .
alli is reduced to weight reduction of adults with excess weight ( body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI &gt; 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ critical , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; alli may not be used by children and young people under 18 , because not enough data on the effectiveness and security . &quot;
&quot; however , Or@@ li@@ stat is however only minimal res@@ or@@ bi@@ ased , is at the Elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of d@@ osing is needed . &quot;
• Over@@ sensitivity to the substance or one of the other components • simultaneous treatment with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Chron@@ icle Mal@@ absorbed • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • simultaneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of occurrence gast@@ ro@@ be in@@ aler symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase when alli is taken along with a fat meal or fatty diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can proceed with improved met@@ abolic control , patients who need a drug against diabetes , prior to start of therapy with alli made a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti @-@ di@@ ab@@ etics must be adapted . &quot;
patients who have alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage must be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to make additional fluctu@@ ations envel@@ oping measures , in order to remedy the oral contrac@@ eption possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study on interactions between pharmaceuticals and in several cases , with simultaneous application of or@@ li@@ stat and Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in has been observed a waste of the Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ d . &quot;
&quot; in combination of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ li@@ stat , the Quick @-@ Values could be affected ( internationally norm@@ ative rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ li@@ stat , the concentr@@ ations of the vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ins in standardi@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be recommended before bed@@ time a compl@@ ementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to take to ensure sufficient re@@ assurance ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a Ein@@ mal@@ d@@ osis Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers , which at the same time Or@@ li@@ stat got , a reduced decrease of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centric . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of Or@@ li@@ stat are mainly hospitable and hang along with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of un@@ perceived fat is prevented .
gast@@ ro@@ un@@ al side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the prescribed side effects , which were determined according to the launch of Or@@ li@@ stat , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of an im@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ si@@ bly that treatment with alli gains in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ uter side effects .
single @-@ p@@ ants of 800 mg Or@@ li@@ stat and multi @-@ range of up to 400 mg three times daily have been administ@@ ered for a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without any significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of the cases of or@@ li@@ stat over@@ dos@@ ed , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as compared with the recommended dose of Or@@ li@@ stat . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals , it can be trac@@ ed from a fast re@@ formation of system@@ ic effects which are attri@@ but@@ able to the li@@ fter properties of or@@ li@@ stat . &quot;
&quot; the therapeutic effect continues in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper d@@ une intest@@ ine , through kov@@ al@@ ente to the active Ser@@ ine @-@ rest of g@@ astr@@ al and p@@ ank@@ ani@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ en . &quot;
&quot; from clinical trials was derived , that 60 mg Or@@ li@@ stat , taken three times daily , the absorption of about 25 % of food fatty is blocked . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled trials in adults with a BMI &gt; 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg Or@@ li@@ stat that was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ cr@@ ite , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course ( table 1 ) and as a portion of those en@@ li@@ ghters that have lost more than 5 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurs in the first six months . &quot;
the average change in the whole cholester@@ in amoun@@ ted with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg -@@ 2.8 % ( output value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.7 % ( output worth 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol amoun@@ ted to Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output rating k@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.2 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
in the area of wa@@ ist the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg ( starting line 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ eters ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chemotherapy ( such as Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ eric , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of an Corti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic medication ) .
the application of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because of the effects in this age group does not provide enough information .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient in the body of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was investigated in three major studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults , which were certain or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; with chemotherapy , a strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are 59 % of patients who were treated with al@@ oh@@ emian in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; with chemotherapy , excessive cut@@ ters for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are demonstrated 81 % of patients who were treated with al@@ oh@@ emian in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission shared Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a permit for the transport of Alo@@ xi across the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ ces : to the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with severe em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy due to cancer disease and v@@ om@@ iting in moder@@ ation @-@ suff@@ ers chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting that is indu@@ ces by a severe em@@ et@@ ogenic chemotherapy may be reinforced by adding any of the cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
&quot; da Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the Dick@@ dar@@ mp@@ ass@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ struc@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after the injection of the injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable to extend the Q@@ T interval setting , or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or tend to be one of such a pro@@ long@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with a further chemical immun@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics , Alo@@ xi is not to be used in the days after chemotherapy or for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies inhi@@ bits Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron un@@ inhi@@ bited against tum@@ ors looking activity of the five dermat@@ ologists ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ eric , Cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , no significant pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single @-@ given dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ or concentration of met@@ o@@ cl@@ op@@ ram@@ ids , one CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in one on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous occurrence of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ in@@ duc@@ tors , C@@ elec@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , cl@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , kni@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ pent@@ ine , Ser@@ tr@@ ine , Ser@@ tr@@ ine and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine , had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; the experience of the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not , therefore , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is necessary from the treating doctor as necessary . &quot;
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to ob@@ serving side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) that were at least possibly with alo@@ xi in relation to head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ struction ( 5 % ) .
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity reaction and reactions at the agreement ( burning , embarrass@@ ment , complaints and pain ) were stated in post marketing reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar skins expressed from un@@ favourable events such as in the other do@@ cking groups ; there were no dose to observe . &quot;
&quot; however , no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , due to the large part of a di@@ aly@@ sis , however , is probably not effective therapy in a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized double @-@ binding studies have been a total of 1,@@ 132 patients with ≤ 50 mg / m2 . carb@@ on@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received , which was given to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ on . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ ind@@ fold study were a total of 667 patients who received a strongly em@@ et@@ ogenic chemotherapy with &gt; &gt; 1500 mg / m2 Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ eric and Dac@@ arb@@ azin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given to Day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ em@@ et@@ ogen@@ s chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ et@@ ogen@@ s chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies to the indication of chemotherapy @-@ in@@ duced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the findings , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion and rep@@ lic@@ isation of the I@@ on channels and to extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the study carried out in 221 healthy promot@@ ers carried out was the assessment of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of i.@@ v. administ@@ ered pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement by 0,25 , 0.75 and 27 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gases follows a initi@@ alization of the plas@@ mak@@ on@@ entri@@ ations a slow elimination of the body with an average @-@ time period of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plas@@ mak@@ on@@ concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the whole dos@@ ages of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following intraven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ plas@@ mak@@ on@@ entri@@ cle at 42 ± 34 % .
&quot; from pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tic simulation , resulting in one day @-@ balanced gift from 0,25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached in 3 consecutive days reached total ex@@ position ( AU@@ C0@@ - ∞ ) with the following @-@ recur@@ sive administration of 0,75 mg higher . however , the C@@ max after the entry of 0,75 mg was higher . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % are eliminated about the kid@@ neys , and some 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic disorder compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for met@@ abolic studies have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ en@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the met@@ abolic mechanism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous m@@ dose of 10 micro@@ gram / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made some 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ one @-@ depth dis@@ abling in sound , the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with severe liver enzy@@ me , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ wer@@ age and the average system exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , reducing the dose is not un@@ justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are lying as sufficiently above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating low relevance for the clinical use . &quot;
10 From pre@@ clinical studies took note that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on channels that are involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ co@@ ders and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the potential for action .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose passed in about the 30@@ times of the therapeutic exposure to people ) , which resulted in an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ tics ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands , however not on mice . &quot;
&quot; underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is intended for a unique application , the relevance of these results is low as for humans . &quot;

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee on Human@@ itarian Agen@@ ts ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expertise in which the acquisition of approval for the procedure for the treatment of hepatitis C has been suggested for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is an effective component named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same arz@@ an effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference phar@@ ma &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) hepatitis C ( one by virus infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation the liver tissue damage also indicates , the values of the Leb@@ er@@ ox@@ ms Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast , into which one gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of the drug . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data about the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , efficacy , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of al@@ ph@@ eon associated with the effectiveness of the reference paper by 455 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , measured how many patients after 12 months of 48 treatment in total , as well as 6 months after hi@@ ring the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 e @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@
&quot; furthermore , concerns have been indicated that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug has not been exploited . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C based on treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after hi@@ ring the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ ates the disease in more patients than on the reference paper ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test was approved in the study and investigation into question whether the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms the body - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with Kru@@ der @-@ drawing skin @-@ infection ) and small infected in@@ consisten@@ cies ( R@@ iss@@ - or cutting @-@ round ) di@@ ced and stit@@ ching wo@@ unds .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which were det@@ ectable or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ul@@ ent micro@@ aphy@@ si@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go against these types of infections may not be affected . &quot;
&quot; al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but with patients under the age of 18 may not be more than 2 % of the surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient talks about two or three days not appe@@ als to the treatment , the physician should consider the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works through block@@ age of bacterial stra@@ ins ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was performed in all five studies of the patients , whose infection was performed after the end of the treatment . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients suffering from plac@@ ebo on the treatment .
&quot; during the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ onds , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ exin showed similar response : when the results of both studies were gathered at Hau@@ tw@@ onds , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were treated to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was found in treating waste water ( aff@@ able hol@@ low rooms in the bodily tissue ) or of infections that have been causing or presum@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA is not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation of the order .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) approved the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go on the short @-@ time treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections in contrast to the risks out@@ weigh : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • reported small la@@ undering , di@@ ced or se@@ aded wound . &quot;
May 2007 the European Commission nomin@@ ee G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. has written authorisation for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients who have no improvement within two or three days are to be examined once more and a altern@@ ate therapy must be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of awareness or heavy local irrit@@ ation through the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be , the treatment should be de@@ hydr@@ ated carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is not used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as Er@@ re@@ ger , or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
clinical trials at secondary wound was the effectiveness of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant St@@ aphy@@ si@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient .
&quot; an alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected site occurs . &quot;
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in and other top@@ ical methods of the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to its low plas@@ mak@@ es@@ centr@@ ations , which were achieved in humans for top@@ ical use on di@@ ced skin or infected se@@ perate wo@@ unds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition is not expected to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the medium ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be on di@@ ced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations are not necessary when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in during a system@@ ic treatment is applied with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive medicine after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clear and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic is prefer@@ able .
&quot; when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding has continued / stop or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / stop , is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most commonly reported ep@@ r@@ ation of irrit@@ ation involving the date of approximately 1 % of the patients concerned . &quot;
&quot; drug Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ atives of plur@@ alism , a substance resulting from Fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ag@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ag@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the pres@@ tr@@ ance mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific relationship of the sea @-@ unit of the bacter@@ i@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the Bin@@ ding of M@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 involved and is located in the region of the Ri@@ bos@@ om@@ alen P @-@ binding and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ Centre .
&quot; due to the bond to this Bin@@ der@@ place hem@@ men Pl@@ euro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , in part P @-@ binding constell@@ ation interactions and prevent the normal formation of active fi@@ bos@@ om@@ inal sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should the application of the local prevalence of the resistance to the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in at least some infectious forms may seem imagin@@ able , a consultation should be pursued by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the insul@@ ates are sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a non @-@ appealing to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes should be considered with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was added to 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and shi@@ el@@ ding skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; out of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be received twice a day for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary arms . &quot;
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in front of the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours following the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system inclusion at the people after top@@ ical use of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 de@@ ported skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP @-@ shirts . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix will be used for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) with children aged between 1 and 15 years old who are not imm@@ uni@@ fy against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be used within two doses of existing vaccines and the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immune immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the two doses can be managed with existing vaccines . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desired can be given Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine .
vaccines have an impact by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ende of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; after a child received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system the viruses and surface as &quot; alien &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the Twin@@ rix adult since 1996 and the vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ inations are used for protection against the same diseases , but will be administ@@ ered Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children under one out of three doses of existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult substances included some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof of the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last inj@@ ecting anti@@ body concentration .
in an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led a month between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of the development of the prevention of hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to one h@@ exag@@ onal and at a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , ap@@ peti@@ t@@ man@@ gel , pain , on the injection , redness , mat@@ ernity ( ti@@ redness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may be used in patients who may possibly be super@@ flu@@ ous ( allergic ) to the substance ; one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) can not be applied .
August 2002 shared the European Commission to G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
&quot; the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ arization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administ@@ ered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her can be desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ der vaccines or with a combination @-@ simple vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis type anti @-@ hepatitis B ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al vaccines .
&quot; it is not yet fully backed up if immune @-@ competent persons , which are addressed to a hepatitis B vaccine as protection , as they are no longer veri@@ fiable antibodies as they are protected by the immun@@ ologic memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As in all injection of inj@@ uri@@ ous substances should always be available immediately for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and supervision . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination of hepatitis B , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated non @-@ virus @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; in case of ha@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis and persons with disorders of the immune system , after the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ arization , under certain circumstances does not achieve sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ body , so in these cases the gift of another vaccine can be required in these cases . &quot;
&quot; since an in@@ tra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tra @-@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a subtle vaccine , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; at Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or cons@@ ular disorders , Ambi@@ rix cannot be in@@ eff@@ ected either in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular g@@ abe . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix had in the second life year in the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us cir@@ cus Type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined mask layer ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens sufficiently ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective , it has to be assumed that perhaps no adequate immune response will be achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , which has been through with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation was carried out in adults was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ i@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever comparable to the frequency which was observed by the former Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccine formats . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 2029 vaccines have been administ@@ ered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study conducted with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix has been compared to the 3 @-@ cans of combination @-@ simple . &quot;
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of ache and mat@@ ernity on a comp@@ uted basis per vaccine Ambi@@ rix but not on a calculation base per person .
&quot; it was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the pro@@ b@@ anden , compared with 39.@@ 1 % in the aut@@ é after the gift of a 3 @-@ doses of the 3 @-@ cans of simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; after the whole vacc@@ in@@ cycle reported 6@@ 6.5 % of the promot@@ ers , the Ambi@@ rix had received , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % at the commission , which were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dos@@ - Com@@ ation@@ simp@@ atic vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of Mat@@ ernity was however , comparable ( d. h. about the entire vaccine @-@ cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ b@@ anden , the ambi@@ rix got , compared with 36,@@ 2 % for the commission , which got the 3 @-@ cans of com@@ pres@@ elling . ) &quot;
the incidence pronounced p@@ ains and mat@@ ernity was small and comparable to that was observed after administration of the combination of op@@ pres@@ sive vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study with 1 @-@ year vacc@@ in@@ ingen the appearance of local actions and all non @-@ profit transactions during the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that which was observed with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B @-@ B surface .
&quot; however , with the 6@@ - to 11@@ - J@@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ rix has been a frequent appearance of pain ( on the injection place ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
the share of vacc@@ inations that schem@@ ati@@ ze over heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B .
&quot; in clinical studies , which have been conducted at vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ ers were for anti @-@ H@@ AV 99@@ ,@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administ@@ ered dosage ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ ers for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 administ@@ ered dosage ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was conducted at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , received 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combined with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was valuable , were the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after gift of the 3 @-@ dose bacteria significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical comparison study from 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after ending the full vaccine ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations took either a 2 @-@ c@@ anned vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hepatitis A @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B .
individuals who were at the time of Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation between 12 and 15 years old could be proven the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ months vaccine .
the immun@@ og@@ ged immun@@ ology campaign against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that which by vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination of ventil@@ ator , comprising 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activ@@ ated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B in a tin volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical study with 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds we could be demonstrated that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies are comparable to the immun@@ isation within the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .
&quot; if the first dose Ambi@@ rix will simultaneously be combined with the refres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ ous , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us cir@@ cus type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or using the first dose of a combined mask layer . it was administ@@ ered to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 cans of the present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ors and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ ers as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing per cap@@ tivity to any foreign @-@ particles and / or physically visible change .

&quot; the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as by bathing in the water contaminated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ asses face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow searches ) and other symptoms that may possibly be a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines the Ambi@@ rix cannot be fully protected from an infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , although the complete vaccine has been completed with 2 cans . &quot;
if you are infected / your child before administration of both vaccines and hepatitis B ( although you / she feels / feels / feel uncomfortable or ill / feels ) a vaccine may possibly not prevent a disease .
&quot; some protection against other infections , which are the liver compens@@ ated or symptoms that are similar to those according to a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through ju@@ ck@@ ing skin beats , respir@@ ations or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you have a serious infection with fever / her child . &quot;
&quot; • If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the usually designated administration of the second vacc@@ inations ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased salary ( 360 ELISA units of an al@@ in@@ in@@ active hepatitis C @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B @-@ surface treatment ) .
the second vacc@@ inations of this vaccine with decreased salary to effective components is usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and might give you a vacc@@ ination prior to ending the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from persons who suffer from heavy blood disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened in your child because of a disorder or treatment in your / his body &apos;s physical defense . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Be your doctor if you are taking your child further medicine , including those who have been vacc@@ inated without de@@ preci@@ ation , or if you have been vacc@@ inated or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have / or has it in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate locations and as possible as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix will be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ inen , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually ambient or nursing women will not be administ@@ ered , except for it is urgent that they will be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix please inform your doctor if you already showed an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
commonly ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ed doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the installation or redness • Mat@@ ernity • irrit@@ ability • head@@ aches • Ap@@ peti@@ tions
case commonly ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ed doses ) : • swelling at the injection floor • fever ( about 38 ° C ) • ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness • gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms
&quot; further side @-@ effects , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with compar@@ ative combination of hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 means per 10,000 im@@ pregn@@ ated cans ) are reported : &quot;
&quot; these include illeg@@ ally limited or extended stops , the it@@ ching can be or bub@@ ble @-@ shaped , swelling of the eyel@@ id and the face , sc@@ ant breathing or s@@ laughter , sudden blood pressure and consci@@ ous@@ nesses . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which have been known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for the transport agreement , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefits risk @-@ ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix had only been brought to market in one Member State ( the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited to the low patient position . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete endo@@ cr@@ atic entities ( brain damage , as a result of high am@@ moni@@ ous con@@ stru@@ ations ) in pre @-@ history . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps is divided - divided into several parts to the meals - sw@@ allowed , under the food mixed , or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ too ( through the stomach blank@@ et in the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) or a Nasen@@ son@@ de ( through the nose in the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) is administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps did not compare with any other treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a head@@ ache that could be compared without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to appetite loss , a ab@@ normal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , impotence , impotence , v@@ om@@ iting , v@@ om@@ iting , rash , rash , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation or weight gain . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) approved to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps were effectively prevented in patients suffering from the oxygen @-@ cycle to high am@@ moni@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved in &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the illness at the time of approval was only limited information on this medicine . &quot;
the use is indic@@ ted by all patients in which a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel has already manifest@@ ed at the newborn age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
&quot; in case of patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fold form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective ) , who manifes@@ ts after the first life of life , there is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ tory pri@@ zep@@ pel@@ ic in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to sw@@ allow tablets or for patients with blo@@ ws , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated according to the protein intoler@@ ance and the patient &apos;s growth and development necessary daily protein intake .
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in herr@@ ing and adults . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who suffer at an early @-@ fixed lack of Carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ko@@ arb@@ or@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rus or argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency need to be argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be administ@@ ered patients with hose disorders , since there is a risk to the emergence of Ö@@ soph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately arrive in the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore in@@ suff@@ iciency in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency and oil @-@ formation clinical conditions only with caution .
&quot; since met@@ abolic and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ ate on liver and the kid@@ neys , should be applied AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS in patients with liver or kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ train@@ dicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; at sub@@ cut@@ aneous g@@ abe of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) came to a multip@@ lication of ne@@ ural comb@@ us@@ al multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a consuming irrit@@ ation of cer@@ vi@@ cious syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be noticed whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is left in the mother &apos;s milk , and for that reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during the breast@@ feeding is con@@ train@@ dicated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS joined 56 % of patients at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( &gt; &gt; &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 year old ab@@ om@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic absorption , he@@ avier Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine , Panz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , periph@@ ery N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred at a 5 month old small child with a different single @-@ dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed erectile dysfunction up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose @-@ limited neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active connection characterized by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ates with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine contained by the kid@@ neys .
Stö@@ chi@@ ometric is seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore considered an alternative support for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disturb@@ ances of the prescription @-@ cycle can be accepted that for each gram is taken in so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,12 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
it is of significance that the diagnosis is provided at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival of survival and the clinical result .
&quot; the progn@@ osis of the early @-@ duty form of the condition associated with the appearance of the initial symptoms in the newborn old was almost always infectious , and the disease itself led to death with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ se and essential amino acids , or using their sti@@ cking @-@ free analog@@ y within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; by ha@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the usage altern@@ ate ways of nit@@ rogen ex@@ cre@@ ate ( so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , so@@ dium ben@@ evol@@ ate and so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ duced K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new @-@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) diagnosed in 80 % . &quot;
patients diagnosed with patients diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary ex@@ cep@@ hal@@ ic drug was the survival rate 100 % but even in these patients it was with time in many with intellectual disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fold form of the disease ( including female patients with the heter@@ ozy@@ got@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ko@@ arb@@ or@@ yl@@ ase @-@ lack ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ tension @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ ous diet , was the over@@ life rate 98 % . &quot;
existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate gets ox@@ i@@ fies , which is arranged in liver and kidney disease with glut@@ amine in ju@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abolic treatment in plas@@ ma and urine were obtained after gift of a single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate on so@@ ber healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after single return as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of oral doses from up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abolic disorder was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous gases of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ du@@ ms &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood sugar to the heart ) , for example , by inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal ( heart attack ) . &quot;
&quot; becomes An@@ gi@@ ox to prevent blood cl@@ auses in patients being applied to a PCI , will be administ@@ ered a higher dose and the inf@@ usion can continue up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approxim@@ ate 14 000 patients took part in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox for all@@ ot@@ ox@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ auses ) with the conventional combination of blood @-@ up treatment with hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;

&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift from G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac accidents or re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year as effective as the conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who subjected themselves to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in terms of all indicators was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for heavy ble@@ eding , in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other mill@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it should not be used in patients which recently had a blood circulation , as well as men with strong hyper@@ tension or serious kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) approved to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a acceptable substitute for hep@@ arin .
September 2004 shared the European Commission The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd a permit for transpor@@ ting An@@ gi@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ ag@@ in@@ far@@ es ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) with a emergency grip or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the input at 1,75 mg / kg / h will be increased . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI can be resum@@ ed according to clinical requirements , the reduced inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg must be administ@@ ered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ oplast@@ y . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initi@@ als of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of itself directly subsequent inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h minimum for the duration of the intervention .
safety and effectiveness of a few Bol@@ us @-@ gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; is this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) shortened to 225 seconds , should be a second bolt of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitute and dil@@ uted medicines should be checked carefully before the application and the bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis should be measured rapidly . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose will be properly administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with mid @-@ heavy kidney functional , ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which were treated one PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din for ACS or not ) , should be a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,@@ 4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
is the ACT value below 225 seconds and is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg and to check the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis .
&quot; in case of patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) which was included in the phase II , the ACT value 5 minutes after gift from the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 At patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is an@@ gi@@ ox con@@ train@@ dicated ( see under section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be introduced 30 minutes after the end of intraven@@ ous dy@@ ed Hep@@ arin or 8 hours following the end of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous g@@ abe by lower Hep@@ arin .
• better known hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or any other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or increased blood risks . • severe un@@ controll@@ able hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacter@@ i@@ tis . • heavy kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a ble@@ eding especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even though at PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , most ble@@ eding occur at arter@@ ial pun@@ ctu@@ ality , can occur in patients suffering from a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) during the treatment of princi@@ pled everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who are staying in War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of IN@@ R Wer@@ ts ( International Reg@@ ised Rati@@ o ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be achieved again prior to the treatment of existing level . &quot;

insul@@ in l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very low for human@@ insul@@ in and the change means that it appears faster and has a shorter active ingredient as a short @-@ effective human@@ insul@@ in .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a slow insul@@ in in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insul@@ in in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body insul@@ in could not be effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was the change of concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
in the first study with type @-@ 1 diabetes the reduction of 0.7 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.7 % at insul@@ in l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was reduced % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 100 % at human normal insul@@ in .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients which may possibly be super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insul@@ in l@@ ul@@ is@@ in , or any of the other components , or in patients who suffer from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must possibly be adjusted when it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that may have on the blood glu@@ cos@@ ity level .
September 2004 the European Commission nomin@@ ates the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH to take a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting either in the area of the abdom@@ inal ceiling , to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion in the area of pancre@@ as . &quot;
&quot; due to the decreased gl@@ uc@@ ose capacity and the dimin@@ ished insul@@ in change , the insul@@ in needs can be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the brand ( herd ) , of insul@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ized etc . ) , the type of insul@@ in ( animal insul@@ in ) and / or the manufacturing method may draw a change of insul@@ in requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or break@@ age of treatment , in particular in patients with a insul@@ in diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis ; these states are potentially viable . &quot;
changing a patient to another insul@@ in type or insul@@ in of a different manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
the time of occurrence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the profile of the used insul@@ in and can therefore change during the change of treatment .
&quot; among the substances that can increase blood sugar lo@@ ops , include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic activity , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Con@@ ver@@ ting @-@ inhibit@@ or , dec@@ ox@@ i@@ f@@ yll@@ able , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , ic@@ ox@@ i@@ f@@ yll@@ able , ic@@ ox@@ i@@ al@@ ysts , ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ ph@@ ide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ies such as bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Guan@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reser@@ pin the symptoms of in@@ ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine conver@@ ged or are missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive medicine showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ insul@@ in regarding pregnancy , the embry@@ onic development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ations enters into the human breast milk , but in general insul@@ in does not enter into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ted after oral milk . &quot;
&quot; below are the clinical trials known from clinical studies , group@@ ed according to system organs and ordered to decre@@ asing the frequency of their occurrence ( very frequently : &gt; &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of availability ) . &quot;

severe hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics with consci@@ ous@@ nesses can be treated using gl@@ in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting of gl@@ uc@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that is given by one trained person or by intraven@@ ous gift of gl@@ uc@@ ose by a doctor .
&quot; after a gl@@ uc@@ ose object , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the Ur@@ - cause for the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insul@@ in lo@@ wers the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose ( in particular through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ a@@ be done by insul@@ in l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal insul@@ in .
&quot; in one study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes . insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic effect of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg has a considerable proportion of glu@@ ing glu@@ ing effect , and at 0,@@ 3 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportionate increase in glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human@@ insul@@ in . &quot;
insul@@ in l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast as possible efficiency as normal human@@ insul@@ in and achiev@@ es complete glu@@ ing effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than Human@@ insul@@ in .
&quot; out of the data was obvious that when an application of insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal has achieved a compar@@ ative , ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is given as with human hol@@ low insul@@ in , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; was insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a better en@@ co@@ efficient control was given than with human hol@@ low insul@@ in , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal is applied , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is given as with human hol@@ low insul@@ in which is given 2 r@@ - gro@@ oves prior to the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insul@@ in l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human@@ ely normal insul@@ in , 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal was given ( figure 1A ) , as well as compared to human@@ ized normal insul@@ in , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) in front of a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
insul@@ in l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - subsequent ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human@@ ely standards - mal@@ insul@@ in that was given 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal ( Image 1@@ C ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
