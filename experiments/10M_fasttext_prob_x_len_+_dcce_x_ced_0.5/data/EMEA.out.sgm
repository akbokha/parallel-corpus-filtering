<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine by schizophrenia and bipolar disorder play a role to normalize the activity of the brain whereby psychological or manic symptoms are reduced and their reparation will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of bilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms have been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection-resolution has been compared in two studies of 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders which compared to increased unrest during a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>

<seg id="22">"Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the recurraging episodes in previously untreated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to insertion (observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extracurred disorders (constant motion), pulling (constant traction), fatigue and exhaustion, resting and exhaustion, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia) and anxiety."</seg>
