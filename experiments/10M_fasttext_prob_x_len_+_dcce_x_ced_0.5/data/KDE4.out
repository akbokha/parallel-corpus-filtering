package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in features can be found in the manual for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions .... opening the map tools and select the required modules there . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of default configuration items from the package , add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system , if you have installed additional software . &quot;
you should install the package ch@@ de@@ base that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras you can see the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , if available , delete . &quot;
you can find the module filter &apos;s module ( also called folder filter ) in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras . with the module you can filter &amp; B @-@ related working directory on different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M building vision in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select extras , choose extras , and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed webpage . as default the display starts with the root marks of the document , example : workshop elements , all other no@@ des are under@@ elements of this root canal . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type I@@ node . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbols and text messages to see the content of your local file system .
&quot; the partic@@ ular@@ ity of &amp; FS@@ View ; it consists of a tree @-@ drawn folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree @-@ Map graphi@@ cally . each object is displayed by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or a folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , great files , even then can be easily recognized in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , it can be seen as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; Unix , command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ k picture is a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your file system . for the simpl@@ est navigation , the rect@@ angle have meaningful color and circum@@ vent . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched across view color mode , can be either depth to the slight detection of the dis@@ cord or the illustration of a different file content like name , owner , group or m@@ ime type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or of the folder . for each property you can determine if there is enough space available to display or whether the area of sub@@ ordinate laws appear . furthermore , you can define the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; with the display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should normally be respected that the surface will be proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ ats in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always respected . it &apos;s a frame that goes under sub@@ ordinate entries to be lost when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; how to place the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries , the implementation is left to leave . here it is for the acc@@ esses and to avoid space losses resulting from within the frame , the best methods of this are the lines , columns , or recur@@ sive division . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal surface for an entry over the menu entry view in the area . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the arranged contract to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordinate entry . &quot;
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction into the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets thought that was developed for applying K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or using extras @-@ gallery ... or using C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the picture gallery , you will open a dialog with which you can view the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option titles of the page allows you to adapt to the title of the picture gallery .
the option pictures per line has a sli@@ der and a rotating field to set the number of mini@@ photographs of each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the cross @-@ field fil@@ en@@ ame of the picture , you will see if the fil@@ en@@ ames will appear under the mini@@ pictures in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ field file size of the picture , you &apos;ll see if the file size is displayed under the mini@@ pictures in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the cross area size picture , you can see if the size of the pictures shown below the mini@@ pictures in the gallery will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , you specify where the gallery will be stored and which sub@@ folder should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file sel@@ ector , in HTML file you will specify where the HTML @-@ page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ field sub@@ folder you can use with a sli@@ der or a rotating field , up to which level the sub @-@ folder are included . &quot;
&quot; with the commands , you can copy , whether the original pictures should be copied into the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the commands of the commentary file , you can specify a text file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the field of colours , you can specify a different color @-@ depth than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings offers you a simple access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; the following behavior of the web browser can be defined here :
&quot; to find the media re @-@ return for the navigation area , see the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or menu under windows navigation area , or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; to play , click on the navigation area of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to media re @-@ return . &quot;
browsers change a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; added with which you can change the brow@@ ser@@ - and operating system detection for individual domains . this is useful for web sites that allow access to only certain browsers .
&quot; the standard browser detection of the &amp; B @-@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ ec@@ ko ) . if you have refused access to this browser , change the browser detection in one of the following options . &quot;
changes the identification of M@@ SI@@ E for sites that decline access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . you need for example the M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
&quot; pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3C standard , or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes , are correctly displayed with the identification of these obsolete browser . &quot;
this option will use the provided browser detection for all pages of the site that you just visit .
&quot; with the menu entry , you can set the scope of the information about the used browser and the operating system in detail . &quot;

&quot; a simple to use camera interfaces will be provided to you with your digital camera cameras , and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tization ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card les@@ hip , which is supported by your OS , with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization ; contains a quick image processing with base processing tools . you can use them to review your photos , commented , and to correct . the adap@@ tations can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ tization ; easy to use , it provides sc@@ oring professional skills at your disposal . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color color and all available modules support the raw @-@ converted using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ export and ICC @-@ color administration . &quot;
&quot; better database with much more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens , which can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ tization ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization has come as easy as possible for them to do . wherever you find yourself in the program , the Help menu features an associated problems or wishes ... This opens a dialog with a sub@@ ordinate link . all necessary information is already registered here . follow the instructions to submit your account . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tised : is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developers came to each other . if you have come to other users of &amp; digi@@ tization ; and hopefully soon , we would like to answer other users of other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be aware of this language therefore powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ tization ; Homepage to learn news about free versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; the best start to get off &amp; digi@@ tization ; to participate , the registration in the developer mailing list . guidance to register in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; when you arrived &amp; digi@@ tization ; for the first time you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can simply specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
in the second box you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data collection is stored . this path will remain the same for all off@@ ences .
&quot; later you can add as many folders such as you want . &amp; digi@@ tised , you can also use as a library library . settings digi@@ k@@ am setup &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder as basic folder . &amp; digi@@ tization ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is displayed . while searching the folder you will get a progress re@@ viewing like this : &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization ; En@@ tries to recur@@ sively exp@@ ose the libr@@ arian in his whole depth . you can do no sub@@ folder , unless it is i@@ ste into hiding folder . this you can make sure you make a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My will have no photos as symbols . you can change that by clicking a photo from the album and this will be used on the folder symbol . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have con@@ figured the basic folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ tization ; your digital camera up . after that , you should learn how to manage my albums and My sampling record to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw data support : if you use the pipe mode of your camera , so it can handle . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , so you will find a list of supported commodities in the menu Help support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ o@@ der@@ settings and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
&quot; a simple to use camera interfaces will be provided to you with your digital camera cameras , and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tization ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card les@@ hip , which is supported by your OS , with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
modern digital cameras are subscri@@ bed by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transfer . the camera will then be implemented as a disk drive . the camera can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras are used to connect the seri@@ als port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; digi@@ tization : use the program for Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera as@@ . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras , which was developed an ever @-@ growing number of over 800 cameras . it allows the transmission of pictures from digital cameras to machines and other periods without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
many old digital cameras do not use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . as photos in general are large files and transmis@@ sions on the seri@@ als port are slow , this connection is out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports these cameras and runs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 through . a complete list of supported cameras can be found in this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ bex@@ if support may be read by checking the umb@@ nails of digi@@ k@@ am reliably . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you will possibly be able to look at lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 or the production could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things there came ; is how easy to expand its functionality through modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view to develop . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate pictures in virtually any way , as it is also a user . their advantage is that it &apos;s much easier to complement &amp; digi@@ tization ; by writing a small module to supplement a function than the changes in the digi@@ tization ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either play the side with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; moving and drop photos everywhere you can place an image in another part of the alpha @-@ tree , over the horizontal divi@@ ding line or in a different application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be put in key@@ word , data list or sou@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; - a fil@@ ly type allows to make it common to you : JP@@ EG , PN@@ G , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . thus , the filter@@ ing is shown on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind it is displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; represents an organized view on your photo shoot . all photos that were saved by &amp; digi@@ aum . these albums can be saved according to the folders , according to the name of their collection in the aluminum features or after the date when the album was first created , sorted by the album , the album can be modified . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a screens@@ hot directly to an album . select the album Im@@ por@@ ate screens@@ hot . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from an album to another , you can drag the photo with the mouse on the target album . you can drag the image via slide or copying . simply dial all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; one album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to specify information about this collection . in order to access the album properties , you have to click on the album and edit in the context menu album settings . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method designed to highlight your albums by selecting them under a common name . if you want to select your photos from the tool@@ bar or view the collection . if you want to add new collections or want to delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
&quot; album Date : is used , if you sort your albums by date with view albums sort by date . &quot;
&quot; the buttons , average , new n@@ ests : this set the date on the oldest , the latest image or the passage of the album . in addition , the average of the pictures tries from its EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of any file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first enter an album in B , the first picture shows the album as a symbol of the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; chosen . sometimes , the first photo is not representative of the album and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to select the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; as an album retro@@ spective option . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; an album can always be included in a collection , and collections cannot be waste . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tised : supports the input of key@@ boards for individual pictures in the field of mine . album collections have another effect . to the collection always include all photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organise your photos . &quot;
&quot; the picture window provides you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this curtain with the two l@@ ump p@@ angs . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time you &apos;ll just wait , while the curtains will be generated . this can be avoided in which you want to generate new images in the menu extras . &quot;
&quot; information on each image will be shown below the image preview . what information this is , you can change over settings and set up . select the albums page and adjust your requirements to your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the Th@@ umb@@ nails have ample support , appearing . if you rest the mouse to rest a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important characteristics including all the keywords of a photo . the screens@@ hot top in the second window shows such an assistant . &quot;
photos are all what happened to &amp; digi@@ tization . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the picture editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements in the menu bar . you can reach the choice between the views of the images , a sli@@ deshow or the editing of the images . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by clicking F@@ 4 image editing ... or select the text menu of the picture with your right mouse button . image processing you will find a guide how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and edit them .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ tization ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a picture in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button . for this , and how you can adjust to your needs if your program is not en@@ umer@@ ated , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should be aware that after the processing of other machine vision programs can come to problems with the contained in the image of your met@@ ad@@ ata . some programs do not store this data with you when you changed the modified image . this way , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ s and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came , makes two ways to shoot . the easiest option is to select with the right mouse button on P@@ review and select Dre@@ ams . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photos , you can right click on the preview and modify F2 from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you came a photo from &amp; digi@@ tization , it will be moved to the sleeve from &amp; k@@ de ; moved . f@@ 8 picture Del@@ ete or ab@@ f If you &apos;d prefer to delete , you can use this by making shift ; discharge . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organize your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ tization ; used either the EX@@ IF @-@ Date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; selecting a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date panel , so that only the photos of the selected day will be shown . &quot;
photos with key@@ word provided provide a flexible and powerful way to organise your photos and cat@@ alog@@ ize . you are sti@@ ckers to be assigned to the photos or whole groups . as soon as a key@@ word can be assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this point or search again . &quot;
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all the photos that have been marked with this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . in this way , you can create your keywords log@@ ically . you can also fold parts of the building &amp; quot ; My sampling record , so that you can find the words you &apos;re looking for , easy to find . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JP@@ EG , saved . you can also re @-@ import your tags in the loss of the database as soon as soon as digi@@ tization ; the pictures notice . &quot;
&quot; you can add new tags by clicking with the right mouse button , either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; or click on an existing key@@ word , and then select new key@@ word , after you click a new key@@ word , after you click on an existing key@@ word , this point will be the key@@ word of this point . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word button and Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself is not deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a key@@ word by moving it to the desired position in the tree and then put it down . then appears a menu that gives you the key@@ word to slide . a key@@ word can be at a time only once a tree .
you can edit the characteristics of a key@@ word by selecting it with the right mouse button and edit the key@@ word key@@ word . you can edit the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; change .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to select the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu As an album track . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in order to use and digi@@ tization ; s functionality with cat@@ ching power to use , you first have to give your photos available , you can click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling record ; alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the presentation of the pictures and select from the context menu key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can display a photo with any number of tags . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords to choose from it . in this way you can choose a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event that it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with a key@@ ring , this is shown below the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can now remove a key@@ word , in which you can select with the right mouse button of the photo and select from the keywords menu . the menu shows you only the keywords which have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline View shows a time depending on the number of images per tim@@ ogra@@ m . a selection frame can be found via this hist@@ ogra@@ m . to select a time frame , you only need to check the subject rect@@ angle of the selection framework . this will display all the related pictures in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections fields and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; neb@@ end he search@@ box is a small lamp that will take place . if you click here , the filter@@ ing will be deleted and all the images found again . if the search is not found , then the lamp is red . &quot;
the advanced search@@ tool is hidden in the rider in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can find this search here as a live search that has always been saving what you have entered as a search criteria . after you saved it was released in the list .
&quot; when you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results are used in my search list in the main window . if you want to select your selection according to my search list , you only need to select the corresponding entry from my search list and select an option in his context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select search , the form provided for entering the search query . if you want to edit next search query , the dialog for the extended search is available to search your previous search . here you can find more rules for searching . you can find more information in the section The tool for enlargement search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the enlargement search makes you an extended search form with many search parameters , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tization ; s database search . &quot;
&quot; the list of seek@@ ers are used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ sian bank . any option can delete or delete it . each option can be added with others about the logical operations . any option can be shortened to others about the logical operations . furthermore , you can create Su@@ ples of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization : characterized any image characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair @-@ algorith@@ m . this allows to compare images by compar@@ ing these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two image types , the more they correspond to . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image . by means of a por@@ k , the result selection can be increased or smaller . if you slide a picture of somewhere else about the symbol of the anim@@ ate search in the left side@@ bar then it will open up and you can drop it there . &quot;
&quot; sk@@ etch : open color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ tization ; finds the right pictures . also here , a spon@@ ge can be set . &quot;
this tab represents an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ Programme . you can push it off with the mouse kno@@ b . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse kno@@ b to drag a square . all pictures inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this is of course required that your pictures Geo @-@ data included .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your Geo @-@ Filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a Live Ge@@ der . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tised : represents a lumin@@ ous in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported formats , also raw materials . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em illumin@@ tically add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the ligh@@ ts@@ table and open the window . if you are back in the check@@ box ; main window , you can open the lumin@@ osity fast with L extras . &quot;
&quot; from the straight line , you can compare the pictures you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . if you see preview synchron@@ ize out of the tool@@ bar and see zoo and shoot operations on one of the pictures , then these can be compared with the other image . you can therefore compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is more suitable to navigate fast from a picture series , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for the compar@@ isons , then the right @-@ right picture is displayed in the left side . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions work directly from the lumin@@ ous as e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both id@@ ols in the lumin@@ aire . this makes it easy for example to link vis@@ ually with loading data . &quot;
&quot; at the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swing function , which you can see in the crossed pole . in order to push the visible area of the picture , you must cut this ank@@ ering and the &amp; L@@ MB . in the mode P@@ review will show them both pictures the same image area . &quot;
&quot; the zo@@ oming is as well as in other views . simply use the z@@ oom @-@ regul@@ ator under the pictures or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse bike to zo@@ oming in the picture and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures , if you are sne@@ ak in the mode . &quot;
&quot; what is a digital adaptation - apart from the de@@ mis@@ word ? digital editing process views every part of the process after the picture was made until the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos , sc@@ ans or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory , but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images , protect and photos again . we focus on the procedure for digital photographer and use them . we look at the procedure for digital phot@@ ogra@@ m and digi@@ tization . we regard this method for digital phot@@ ogra@@ m the &amp; digi@@ tization . we look at the procedure for digital phot@@ ogra@@ m the &amp; digi@@ tization . we regard this method for digital phot@@ ogra@@ m the &amp; digi@@ tization . we focus on the procedure for digital phot@@ ogra@@ m the &amp; digi@@ tization . we regard this method for digital phot@@ ogra@@ m the &amp; digi@@ tization . we focus on the procedure for digital photographer and use them . we look at the procedure for digital phot@@ ogra@@ m the &amp; digi@@ tization . we look at the procedure for digital phot@@ ogra@@ m the &amp; digi@@ tization . we focus on the procedure for digital phot@@ ogra@@ m the &amp; digi@@ tization . we regard this method for digital phot@@ ogra@@ m the &amp; digi@@ tization . we regard this method for digital phot@@ ogra@@ m the &amp; digi@@ tization . we focus on the procedure for digital phot@@ ogra@@ m the &amp; digi@@ tization . we regard this method for digital phot@@ ogra@@ m the &amp; digi@@ tization . we focus on the procedure for digital phot@@ ogra@@ m the &amp; digi@@ tization . we

met@@ ad@@ ata data are defined as data . met@@ ad@@ ata are defined in accordance with your definition data to provide information about or documentation of other data that can be managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you find more than 1,000 photos on your computer . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use definitely not &amp; digi@@ tization ; then the approach the met@@ ad@@ ata to save both in a database and in the image files are guaranteed to be able to access it with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you need to be installed in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be saved to your computer , whether you want to save them on a reserved drive &amp; etc ; please note that you &apos;ll have to switch to a larger drive on a track . &quot;
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found fast via your location . you &apos;ll be able to organise your data in a year several times . if you use plenty of photos then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . you then export a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , resulting intake of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will not be re@@ organized and you will not re @-@ organise your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the option met@@ ad@@ ata to enable met@@ ad@@ ata to activate in the Settings page of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ tization . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC collect data into the file , then you can select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the menu album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? this represents a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work , since you should now select every photo key@@ word , cap@@ tions and evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute you need and start the value . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let us talk with key@@ boards , key@@ boards , how to proceed with other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you imported kat@@ alogue images from another source with built @-@ up key@@ boards , then it &apos;s done automatically ; automatically the tree for you build b@@ z@@ w the pictures in the right place . the changes of the Hier@@ archy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by making a sub@@ tree to another . the modified key@@ word will be done by &amp; digi@@ tization ; updated while the under@@ trees are persec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; the graphics shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cut . this is a very crude representation , as each block of met@@ ad@@ ata is made in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and cal@@ ender dates of all pictures . &quot;
&quot; enough of the key@@ word - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alo@@ ise your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you do not want to see most anyone your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you that of the Lan@@ ge@@ field of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing , associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you might even hear the silence . the cap@@ tion therefore has changed your perception of this panor@@ amas . &quot;
&quot; for others who regard your photos , the title may possibly be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . remember , the key is to transmit it to the viewer that you move through the motif that you move has to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a cap@@ tion for itself to work alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ tised , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , when you export your pictures into web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported to your wishes in the lab@@ eling and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystem . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you have to find in another city without a navigation system ? it was not earth a boring planet in front of G@@ oogle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train moves the spatial presentation now already with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to util@@ ise the ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation are already unt@@ apped and will be able to open in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export k@@ ml files with geographical indications . you can also export the pictures on the reception . you can also export the pictures at G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the G@@ oogle@@ Maps @-@ viewer . &quot;
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and identi@@ fies the practice of copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also in all changed versions so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the furnishings of &amp; digi@@ tization : as information can be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and Writ@@ er ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to be the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization may be used . after that value , he should no longer be changed . this field does not support even sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as parti@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; authors ( syn@@ onym for the author ) : linked to the author . examples of this field contains the title of the photographer . examples of this can be titles like : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent Phot@@ ograph . since this is a note to the author &apos;s author , must be filled this as well . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider &apos;s field to identify who the photo does . this must not necessarily be the author . if the photographer does not necessarily indicate the author , then you can offer the photo others . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group / Agency offers the image here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this is no protection against abuse . each of which is a little bit more than basics in working with machine can delete or change . the solution for this problem is digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique for each picture . it arrived ; in the near future there will be such a module for st@@ acking processing .
&quot; topics : PL@@ AT@@ TEN@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , turn@@ out , currents , ECC , transmission errors , ag@@ eing the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , temperature , temperature , and super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that you can happen at traditional paper pictures or negative . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest collection of data collection in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs and you must not take longer than a few years . of course , you can also stop CDs and DVDs in archives . naturally , there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe this is in your jud@@ gement room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you use good Dis@@ cs and good cav@@ ity . the best DVD recording are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much reliable . it &apos;s about the right select . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to error , even if you have just been written , therefore use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the format@@ ting and the check@@ sum . despite this massive protection it needs through chemical ag@@ eing , ultr@@ avi@@ olet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster . it runs under Windows and Linux ; it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to def@@ ective data from damaged dis@@ ks , HDDs , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray dis@@ ks seem to save the For@@ mat@@ war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost h@@ exag@@ al the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything which has been said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu @-@ ray Disk .
&quot; slowly burn with a good cav@@ ity on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . read then the media with a description , date and author labels . do not forget the data on the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
Disk@@ Manufactur@@ ers reserve your statistics for yourself . your manufacturer &apos;s n@@ ants include a new disk but not the data . Google will provide a major field study on the trou@@ bles@@ mechanisms of dis@@ ks : dis@@ on study
&quot; in brief : dis@@ ks hold on the longest when you are operated in the temper@@ art@@ age range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . with lower temper@@ ament , S@@ MAR@@ T may not notice the most common failure . these are particular read@@ ability and publishing frequency . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete se@@ perate due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to an electric case before you have backed the files , but these losses usually leave without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices Strom@@ ks does not make much effort , that can cause heavy damage and high @-@ speed cables , complete data loss , break@@ age , destruction mother@@ boards and other default effects . therefore , protect oneself against the im@@ avoidable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against black@@ heads is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a tool that a part of the energy heat is absorbed and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . however , remember that not each plug @-@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should consider that it offers the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care of protecting the protection against fl@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should also be sure that all the periph@@ ery can be connected to your system . some manufacturers are also available for phone cable and cable TV . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial Cable of the Cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the TV map . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the mo@@ dem . there@@ with you are ideal for travelling . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection , protect your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete loss . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in a inter@@ rup@@ tive power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protection from over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically store cordless energy , if a power cut out . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system . if you purchase a US@@ V , you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . beyond that , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concern the potential risk which is exposed to your computer system and compare its security in power operations with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference when you consider how well your computer is used . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go into the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use them as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; they are very expensive compared to hard drives , but very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution but it is not a general security solution . it is too slow .
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online storage services available to photos . their free memory is available in 1 GB . the professional version gives you more available , in case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for 25 $ per year you get unexpected memory , which should be checked in reality only . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data security , the web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically consul@@ ted thanks to the TCP @-@ protocol and with the large companies is included in the offer a backup and a distribution of distribution . thus , they are des@@ patch . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs represent at least the data integr@@ ator between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody says when a transmission error occurred to you . all these mal@@ functions remain un@@ discovered until you one day open up to one day . no one seems to have thought in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly safer data way than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission lu@@ gs because they create inter@@ ferences within the data streams . on normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission issues , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with record errors , and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ ate file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanism that is used and is available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the core .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . in Not@@ ebooks , the proportion of the theft is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the most . it leads to a lesser damage , as e.g. theft or new@@ installations ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; however , no longer exists for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travel F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the widespread file systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rup@@ tive data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the investig@@ ational process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file wasn &apos;t completely saved before the issue entered , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human failures are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors from digital cameras are located 1 @-@ 2 Bl@@ ending settings of fundamental physical borders . it is meant that while the technology is developing , there is a natural border to these progress . sensitivity and smoking characteristics are not far away from this limit . &quot;
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ al@@ os . even if this resolution is already too high for comp@@ ak@@ t@@ cameras and the end result is rather deterior@@ ating . a sensor size of 6 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el and a high quality optics are the Optim@@ um for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have a full format of 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el . for higher resolution you need a full format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard drive you get today for 100 &amp; euro . so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . so , you can only secure your data in a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the rein@@ st@@ allation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size change of dis@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash suggests you even if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot . forget flight bu@@ ds : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster is always a local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , to your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as stated above is a common reason for loss of data in spite of securing the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files must be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential Use : a backup of the files changed since the last full use . generates a complete snap@@ shot of two periods : that of the complete review and the last difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files changed since the last backup . generates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time again . this backup comes from a version@@ ing system next to the exception that it is only ab@@ stain@@ ed and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmis@@ sions . this is com@@ pressed and if you want to increase security about ss@@ h .
do you secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; this procedure allows you enough time to discover losses and restore it . at the same time you come for securing a total daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . any further dil@@ ution should be manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , in the file file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ viewing images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , refl@@ ections , ... , using the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable images will survive the next 40 year , that is about time period in which you really are interested in your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; because the future due to your nature is un@@ predic@@ table , you must look at caution and evaluate the time passes . unfortunately , there is no other option as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered with explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every@@ time you change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means enlarge .
&quot; let &apos;s take the scal@@ ability that you have planned and enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . on * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and shift the shift to a new record : &quot;
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected from the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the record in MB@@ s ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software may be able to read it then you can make it yourself . this task becomes easier from year to year .
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that disappears from the market . you should therefore not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; PN@@ G was supposed to replace GI@@ F as an open source standard , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . the disadvantage is that there is relative many administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F needs and a lengthy under@@ expression . this format we want to recommend you to Save your pictures . &quot;
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be saved into un@@ com@@ pressed form or in a container with a lu@@ red com@@ pression algorithms . it is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative File format is developed a licence @-@ free and offensive format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G is now developed on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is committed to the use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a handful of camera manufacturers is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon there too .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace all its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ forms : a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . file information is connected to the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers make it a original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , mostly in the raw format , as it saves the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the file file . however , you should think about whether you use DN@@ G as containers and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization supporting a wide range of applications and business models . for the activities of D@@ CM@@ I and support the D@@ CM@@ I groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the dealer @-@ maker or the scanner . as long as the images are on the cam@@ corder , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fin@@ ite process you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ tised ; edit , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata to the met@@ ad@@ ata . these were cut down from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the edited paintings for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only in Web@@ galleries , coding you in MPEG , use in contact blades , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to add your photos into &amp; digi@@ . in the section adding a photo to an album you &apos;ll find a description , as you can add photos to you on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; to use this to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it is trying to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , there will be a skill or indicator of all photos on the camera . some cameras do not display pre @-@ umb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame and a symbol of the file order is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information on each entry . with the side @-@ do properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and photo information , which is stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras do not have any information available . &quot;
&quot; the Reiter Metad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as Exif , manufacturing not@@ ebook , GPS etc . of the picture . this information is the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata @-@ side@@ bar . or the image editing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button downloading and then download the photos from their camera in a single album . I downloaded the photos and we recommend you to check if the photos were safely released in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired by default method from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , you can download the button below and then download it automatically . the kno@@ b selected will be chosen until you have chosen some photos . &quot;
&quot; when your camera supports this , an option is new to download . these pictures have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ tised . in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the vor@@ tices . if you choose this option , of course , only the new images are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you download the buttons All download or chosen download , a dialogue with which you can select the target album , see how regular folder is sorted as regular folder . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after having selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ tization ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all of them by clicking the button below . if you just want to delete it , you must select it first and then delete the chosen . &quot;
&quot; please note that there are no possibility to restore you from the camera to restore it . so you should carefully review whether the photos do not delete them from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras do not use cameras as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not especially useful names . the fil@@ en@@ ame are usually returned , after the photos from the camera has been deleted . therefore , it can be sensible to integrate the date and time when the image has been made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the picture and for a file @-@ based base . if you use this last option , automatically one folder is created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three further options that are performed before the photos on the record are stored . the first two concern the data on the author in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for any downloaded images . &quot;
if you want a different file format than the standard format you can use for example in the editing field the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d . H : % M : % S . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
&quot; if you use the option of camera data , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in small letters . or in case case you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ tization ; for a photo used , the camera is displayed in P@@ review . your settings to ren@@ ame will be saved and automatically used if you open the camera next time . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization : can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to time recording . not all cameras provide this information . in section side@@ bar Metad@@ ata you can read more details , about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally switched , and if your camera does not provide this information , lets digi@@ tization ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic rotation speed , use the button extension and choose the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera is made available through the date when the photo has been made , this instruction may be made available for download . all pictures with the same date will be retri@@ eved . all pictures with the same date will be available in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ panel . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read , which information you could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually off @-@ off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ tization ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to use this option and select the option based on the bottom of the window at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the simpl@@ est way to load photos from their computer to your camera is the button downloading . select the file @-@ dial dialog &amp; k@@ de ; you can select the files you want to upload it . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ ills ; methods .
&quot; after the selection is done , asking &amp; digi@@ tization ; you where the images will be loaded highly . a folder selection dialog box appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . there@@ with , a position is meant to be indicated in long@@ itu@@ dinal and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane in order to dis@@ link an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , architectural and real estate agents may use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you were later forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization ; users want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization ; users want to send the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to take the position data of a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , Satt@@ el@@ ites and maps . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , through a post@@ processing of GPS data and image files using the manual input ( manual ) and finally via the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera which has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;

downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the geographical assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract data from pictures and GPS . on the following page you can extract the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs carefully chosen coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ g@@ oogle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ g@@ oogle@@ .com does not show European road cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came to give you so much control over his work@@ flow as possible . there are many settings to access the behavior of it . change to these settings , you need to choose from this settings ; you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; select action can be displayed in advance P@@ review or picture editing . so you place the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ tised , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically selected to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , when the option is selected to download from the camera interfaces . also with Database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; car title is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should contain the photographer of the photographer . this can be a photographer , like an employee , freel@@ ance photographer , or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author area , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to enter the photo . this must not be the author , then these organizations should be registered here as this is the picture of the other &amp; quot ; . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or agency should be provided here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . there@@ with it is achieved that the met@@ ad@@ ata are permanent in the image and not only entered in the database of &amp; digi@@ ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; images are stored as em@@ ett@@ led cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JP@@ EG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you can read to your photos , with which described in pictures can also be viewed by other images , these are written by the types of digi@@ tization ; over@@ written . &quot;
&quot; the site settings contains all options for the information that appear , when the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor in the main window via a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; B &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tization ; supports a number of different formats and some video formats and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ tization ; view , you can add the file expand@@ able to this list and remove . any file in one &amp; digi@@ tization ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , who has not got any of these extensions , ignored by &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Settings to the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the illumin@@ ative of &amp; digi@@ tization : can be set on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have however switched different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; in the whole photo size . if you have one , then you can get better visible results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar in full @-@ mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bri@@ ghter color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the picture editing this picture mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched off .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are coded as a higher resolution of the bul@@ b as in the colour formations . please read this article in Wikipedia about the near@@ er explanation .
&quot; with setting PN@@ G com@@ pression you can reduce the size of PN@@ G files . this operation is not reducing the image quality , because PN@@ G is required to put more time to output and pack . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can put this value on a high com@@ pression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high com@@ pression . &quot;
with the option T@@ IF@@ F files com@@ press the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithms for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it does not reduce the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it has no influence on the picture quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorith@@ m .
&quot; with the setting low @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can retri@@ eve lu@@ st@@ proof . even if you have written the embarrass@@ ment setting , the relation between quality of loss and fil@@ esi@@ ze is far better than in the normal JP@@ EG . as this paragraph was not supported , however , was still in planning . &quot;
&quot; in the previous versions of digi@@ tization , the picture editing only a picture of photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the picture editing . &quot;
&quot; the standard amount is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ time green pixels of the C@@ CD sensor , this difference generates a little loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , eliminated but the 2x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ mu@@ ster with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the white pull @-@ off of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Autom@@ atic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white is not set up . default , it is a fixed color @-@ balance , which is photographed on a white card that is photographed in sunlight . &quot;
this setting will only support for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps more details in the pick@@ up . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the default it is the top @-@ light , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera out the sh@@ re@@ ous results , as it presents the pick@@ up in various ros@@ at@@ nen . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the pick@@ up to re@@ construct . &quot;
&quot; this is possible since blue pixels in general is not as fast s@@ ati@@ ful like green and red . it &apos;s , and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try the missing green pix@@ el to re@@ construct the missing blue pix@@ el . of course , this is a question how much colour or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option re@@ constructed , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be customized for each image separately . &quot;
&quot; Set the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to put it a bit higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tization . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed as conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing -@@ algorith@@ m is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the divi@@ ding image sensor that presents a lot of cameras and that presents a matrix of colour pixels . this algorith@@ m is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bra@@ construction .
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; and D@@ cra@@ w put you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ N@@ G @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ pol@@ ation ) was the first algorith@@ m of D@@ cra@@ w . it produces a color variation in the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you are executed during the blank . &quot;
a profile translated the color information and returns instructions like this should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tization ; information as to translate the color information from a colour tree in the other shows the colors as accurately as possible .
&quot; behavior issues , if an image is opened in the image processing / color administration module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; click here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tised : examine this folder during the Star@@ ts . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed in the opening of the raw file later .
the color administration view is an alternative against X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your images colored not the entire screen .
&quot; input profiles should be applied to the camera unit and model that you use . not all profiles are included in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have a color @-@ tone mapping or Gam@@ mak@@ or@@ re@@ aliz@@ ations . this means that you do not have the color ton@@ mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate like your image can be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print a smaller colour area than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated instead of leaving you manually , rather than rely on the blind algorith@@ m of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is fairly obvious that color @-@ profile is designed for what is provided . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles they fit together . this answer is of course un@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile allows the style to detect the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutr@@ ality , P for portrait and S for the Standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; sculp@@ tors and sculp@@ tors ; many modules were supported to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface to work together . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the items you want to use , and then these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ command for tasks , which can be performed by modules , can be set in the menu under settings short@@ cut . &quot;
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the sli@@ deshow should be easy to understand . the top regul@@ ator j@@ us@@ ks the time between the cap@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other crossing fields turn the met@@ ad@@ ata and / or , which are in the lower end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; camera characteristics are shown on the left side a list of all supported cameras . on the right hand side there is a button of Autom@@ atic recognition that is trying to identify the camera properly and in the image mode . these are the port settings . currently , here are ser@@ ial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
at the lower end you can put the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera . you need to specify the path here / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / remo@@ vable ) on which you attach your camera .
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; to use , you must connect the camera to your computer to switch it in the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out whether it came out ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es ; if not , you can set cam@@ amo@@ del and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can choose any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confirmation for the moving of &gt; pictures in the tubes of images , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ tization ; when delet@@ ing a photo in an album . in the sections of a photo and del@@ e@@ tion of an album you find further details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ tization ; to be applied , if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to apply changes to the button Select changes . &quot;
you can also bind the display of the welcome screen by &amp; digi@@ tised ; at the Star@@ ten speed you speed up the start @-@ run of &amp; digi@@ tised .
&quot; the setting of Bei@@ m Start after new photos forces &amp; digi@@ tised ; the basic folder after new or deleted albums / photos came to search . this extends the starting point of &amp; digi@@ tization ; if something out of the base folder was deleted , ask &amp; digi@@ tization ; you whether it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
&quot; different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ tised , to suit the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected using settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available design is listed below : &quot;
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in creating a new design for digi@@ tization , please find more information about this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; contains a quick picture editing with some base tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image , or through the context menu of the preview display and selection of advertisements . &quot;
the image processing contains a range of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in digi@@ tization ; therefore they are under certain circumstances not part of your distribution . you can find further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the section image editing .
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , enlargement factor and the current size . &quot;
&quot; menu bar on the upper edge , and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly used functions . &quot;
&quot; the processing functions of images change your photos . none of the functions will however change the original photo , before you used file stor@@ ing or the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so you should install a copy of your image , before you change it . you can do so with the stor@@ ing file . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the mouse button , or using the button illumin@@ ating the image editing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last time . &quot;
almost every action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or recovered . the last action you can be und@@ o by clicking back@@ ups and be restored by selecting but@@ ton@@ ing from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make yourself the keyboard abbrevi@@ ations , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to the back@@ rest and make C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restart . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the return single or re @-@ button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer press , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between them are also und@@ one or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons , image high , image below or the entries in the menu file , you are asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can start in the photo and out of zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse bike or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu menu .
&quot; to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full picture mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view , in which you can use the tool@@ bar button . normally , you can view this in the setup dialog by &amp; digi@@ tised ; change this from the &amp; digi@@ tised ; main window view . see the section on setup the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select in the menu file image and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; pressure dialog . you can adjust here the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or whole propositions . whole image view@@ ings can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album print assist@@ ent . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; main window has a side bar on the right edge that makes important information and actions available for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , without the Navig@@ ational use , even in the image editing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is displayed : &quot;
multi@@ f@@ itter Click on the same rider leaves the side bar or disappear into the edge .
&quot; in the cap@@ tion view , you can insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size or insert . note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . that means that all special characters are allowed to be used in EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data support only ASC@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are illustrated according to 2000 characters and are shaped special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC circul@@ atory field in other applications so you should notice these limitations .
&quot; once you have commented out , you either use the button or simply move to the next picture , the accus@@ ations are then stored . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the apply button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the met@@ ad@@ ata to the files . however , this will always be performed if you choose a met@@ ad@@ ata @-@ settings that will always be written into the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Su@@ ples and sor@@ rows . it can be applied with a single click of the 5 stars onto the side@@ bar , or using the short@@ cut bar . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ note shows a search box for the filter@@ ing of the key@@ word , the key@@ word and a selection box with the previously in this &amp; digi@@ tization ; -@@ Session un@@ spo@@ ilt . &quot;
the sampling tree is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the given search word . you can restrict the number of ways in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering the key@@ boards at a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
key@@ word ( s ) can also be set by check@@ ing of appropriate domains in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; when several pictures are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the keywords , this will only be applied to the original image and not to the whole selection , if you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section called T@@ wor@@ ding filter . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the pictures shown in the main window . usually , the left side bar with their album , - fil@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and su@@ chan@@ ics are used . if in addition one or more sampling filter from the right side is used , only the amount of these two is displayed . all checked words are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop out . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put it on the choice . then a dialogue you ask if you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is available on No keywords , which was selected with Str@@ g + a , and after that , a key@@ word from the right key@@ word to select and stored there . a dialogue was asked if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes will take place at every start of the program . it can also be switched on using settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and you will notice that it is one or it would have to be , you can easily change it with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; 3 ) : the argument for oper@@ ator , which is a name or string which is already set in the database . &quot;
you can e.g. specify an extension search for all the items of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the cross field at the end of the rule and then to use the button group . the options are as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I used it primarily on &amp; digi@@ ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed work@@ flow is that the colors available from your camera or scanner , with a colour @-@ managed work@@ flow . with a colour @-@ managed work@@ flow , you can reach that colors on your monitor corresponds to those from your camera or scanner . &quot;
&quot; when the theme is on colour administration , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to push for the results . unfortunately , the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you adequate background information about color administration . the purpose of this tutorial will enable you to make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flow meets all six below criteria , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color administration . &quot;
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB bul@@ br@@ ink . ( further information can be found below )
your only other imaging are by e @-@ mail or the Web where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard is .
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for all so easy , why should one then use another color tree and to make thoughts about colour administration ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to colours we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ ett@@ able region , and the colors in the s@@ GB color tree , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with several larger farms , so visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click on information and then at Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in R@@ GB @-@ Far@@ br@@ aum or not , you must finish your monitor k@@ alli@@ ate , since s@@ R@@ GB does not close the circle . if you are working as in the Far@@ br@@ aum of s@@ R@@ GB , you must either use your monitor to the s@@ GB standard , an appropriate monitoring profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic proo@@ fs that can improve a picture in most cases , use it before you try a further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , de@@ generation , automatic de@@ bit and contrast expand from the menu Rev@@ ised Autom@@ atic correction automatically try to experiment with your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize , this method is scal@@ able over the entire image , so the dark point is black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point as bright as possible without its colour sh@@ aded . this function is often a mag@@ ic correction of images that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; this method mim@@ ics the illumin@@ ator of the colors of the chosen image , so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of the Intens@@ ity is as flat as possible . there@@ with , the same very good results in improving the contr@@ ast@@ it of an image , sometimes it produces just g@@ arbage . it is a very powerful operation which affects either wonders in a picture or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue canal . you select the dark and bright boar@@ der @-@ tones and j@@ us@@ hes the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ ogra@@ m area . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image through the shifting of the lowest and highest values in the largest area and a new ji@@ b@@ ation of all values in between . this is only visible in full images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ off of &amp; digi@@ tization ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry the white cut off a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ equal correction is slightly limited to a color tree with 8 @-@ bit per colour . in case you can perform too far from the original image . if you are able to perform the white mode in the blank mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode can work , so your possibilities to correction is better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white @-@ like algorithms , protected by P@@ aw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it over the menu @-@ free colors white pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ showcase can be adjusted within the size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target display . the preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white window , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the Ziel@@ ony has a red mark@@ er . the pix@@ el of the pix@@ el under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
&quot; right above , a hist@@ ogra@@ m is displayed that dynam@@ ometer is changing as soon as you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pix@@ el is very small L@@ umin@@ os@@ os . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed . the amount is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow can improve the shadow details of your photos or to download it . &quot;
&quot; using the above controls to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature @-@ Pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture retro@@ spective to use selected color for the calculation of the paint temperature of the whit@@ eboard . this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white pick@@ up with the list of settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the rem@@ uner@@ ation indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pix@@ el is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white cut . this is displayed in the preview as r@@ an indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons saving as and loading make exactly this . every setting of the white comparison you have set you can save you in a text file and then load later .
&quot; the button pres@@ ets is setting up all the filter values again to its default values and the associated @-@ neutral white de@@ coder . note that also , neutral settings will be a different photo as your original . if you save it , your original image will change . &quot;
&quot; you can set the code sti@@ ckers per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality pictures . this coding is needed better for high quality pictures . this coding is also needed for high quality pictures , calcul@@ ating time and is nur@@ tured on the formats PN@@ G , PN@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G formats . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialogue as to the processing of raw image . it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles . color ton@@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the use of color , you can rate the chapter color administration . &quot;
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to configure several shades . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same mistake , so you can always find the same correction . in manual for sound correc@@ tions you can find more information . &quot;
a very powerful possibility of correc@@ ting problems is the tool for Gr@@ ad@@ ation that you can find under colors Gr@@ ad@@ ation in the menu .
&quot; digi@@ tization ; tool colour effects presents you four colour effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ een filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar arization , also Sab@@ ati@@ ans was mentioned , an effect of the picture was created when one partly developed pressure of a short flash . this had the effect that the bri@@ gh@@ tens areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second ill@@ um@@ ination . this tool was a part of neg@@ atively on the picture . this tool permits you to see this interesting effect fin@@ ely . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity demonstrates the image which is chem@@ ically possible . another increase is finally generated a negative image , that thus does not produce on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the solar system . the original image is the ( 1 ) , which is processed ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % . &quot;
&quot; the Vi@@ vid @-@ Filter is simul@@ ated the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a s@@ ati@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrast , which makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it easy , he gets nic@@ er many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light optim@@ ised colour film created by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ oth , and thus a reference for its smooth sculpture structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly satisfied colors and especially some photographers , especially those that have little landscapes ab@@ ble , too much . &quot;
&quot; the ne@@ on@@ filter si@@ simul@@ ated Ne@@ on@@ shine at the contr@@ ast@@ eries . the parameter level controls the brightness of the outcome and the sli@@ der repeat@@ ed@@ ures the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . at large images , the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and therefore it isn &apos;t uncommon to correct the color contr@@ ast and the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your benefits can be viewed in P@@ review . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be used .
&quot; when you make a photo with bad light conditions , you can reduce the converted problem : one too big satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce a good choice for brightness / satur@@ ation . all the changes you can perform in P@@ review . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool Gr@@ ad@@ ation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / Gamma is the tool key correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue at this tool is very complicated , you need for the purposes of the sli@@ der . tangible the three slides below the hist@@ ogra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graphs of the Intens@@ ity values , a hist@@ ogra@@ m of the active channel or the selected area . under the graphs are three slides into the cli@@ cked and which can be moved , to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and right side the light areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and watch how the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . preview is dynam@@ ically , using the settings of the picture , updated . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted if the hist@@ ogra@@ m is frequently displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . in pictures the large areas of a constant color will contain the linear hist@@ ogra@@ m of a single column . in this case the log@@ istical of profit is beneficial .
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the top priority for dark sounds , the mean for the bright tones and the bottom for middle tones , frequently gam@@ ma values . &quot;
&quot; the three colours can be used in the original image of the original image to automatically test the input values of shadows , medium and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators to change the output values , e.g. using the input values . for example , the com@@ pression of output values can be used for example to create a developed image as a background while something else is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this kno@@ b , the values are automatically set depending on the intensity value of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and store : with these buttons , the values presented in the fil@@ es@@ ystem are stored and later loaded . this Gimp is used in the format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three colours will use the input values automatically for all shade , medium and solar tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette to use the input values of the hist@@ ogra@@ m for Rot@@ - , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the option of over@@ loading indicator controls all color channels , to locate transmitted pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview display and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as output values are unchanged . the original image is with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target display is displayed dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modifications channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel from the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to change between a linear and logical view . for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera mode . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ically mode helps to go further . &quot;
&quot; if you postp@@ one another left to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones with dar@@ ker expressions and that the related image pix@@ el dar@@ ker will become dark . &quot;
&quot; on the review of the original image is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to shift this mark@@ er on the area you want to change , the right line is displayed on the curve , which is the original value . create a point on this line and then move it down and down to the value according to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each bend that you can generated is saved in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gimp Cur@@ ven@@ format .
&quot; if you want this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ets buttons automatically create the check@@ points of curve for all channels of shadow , middle and solar tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the original image to put the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ escent curve . &quot;
&quot; the option of over@@ loading indicator controls all paint channels , to view over@@ exposed pix@@ el . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the result displayed only in the preview display and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ator canal . shadow and Sundays has been used with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and that corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or to change the color grad@@ ations of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of images .
&quot; with the can@@ al@@ op@@ tionally , you can choose the color for the hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be seen as compared to your own rider . &quot;
preview the target image has a red mark@@ er . when you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m to show you the appropriate color value .
&quot; controls the controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to activate these channels . if you also activate the appropriate color components , as the channel mix@@ er then activate the option of generating great black and white con@@ versions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you blend Monoch@@ rome , the reduction of a color occurs to a visible noise which comes from the bul@@ lets . Far@@ dare do not appear at the same place in the color canal and how the case is the case you can improve your Monoch@@ rome conversion possible in which you would reduce the bul@@ let first . &quot;
the stor@@ ing and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any score option can save you for later and then load the file format is the Gimp channel Mix@@ er format .
&quot; the option of over@@ loading indicator controls all color channels , to locate transmitted pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview display and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been re@@ activated . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the advertis@@ ed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography was always intrigu@@ ing due to your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work@@ step because color pictures can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film rolling profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : simul@@ ated a black / white film coating with a green lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good at all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filmed : simul@@ ated a black / white film coverage with a angen Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air images . thus similar to the 002 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) orange filmed . &quot;
rot@@ filter : simul@@ ated a black / white film coating with a red lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates a dramatic impact @-@ effect and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ light to day time . so much like the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ated a black / white film coating with a yellow liner correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yel@@ lo@@ filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while he adds a bit of cold in the fri@@ ction . this is very similar to the process of the p@@ ile of printing and the re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to 005 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool texture , you can apply decorative textures on a picture . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , the p@@ inch of an old master , a pop @-@ picture on a wall . the menu @-@ in picture texture apply the picture editing can be used for this . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the sem@@ bl@@ ance of depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper textures was used in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the altered under ( 2 ) see . the parameters Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool frame can add a decorative framework to add a picture .
to keep the eye of an beh@@ older in the limits of a picture is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative setting . this is a psychological barrier to sc@@ oring eye . under the picture frame the module can be started from the picture editing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you put the desired standard type for your image . per@@ si@@ le the picture with a coloured line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , f@@ ew@@ ed it with a nice three @-@ dimensional setting of the ideal for a button frame with patterns added . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the finish setting will be greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool under aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text in an image at any point . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text editor , orientation , color from the color tree and the character set with its characteristics . the bigger the picture , the larger must be the character set . at the end simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already , the picture is ready . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click on the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; after the picture has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool sten@@ cil , you can put a template on a picture . &quot;
you can apply the picture of sten@@ cil in the image processing can be used to put it over a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to add the PN@@ G file format and should work with maximum com@@ pression of the file size . whom you got to add a template in english to the &amp; digi@@ tization ; sten@@ cil database checking @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; when you use this tool for the first time , you &apos;ll have to put your template folder with the kno@@ b @-@ folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you copied the template . these settings will be used for the next start@@ up . &quot;
&quot; after the root canal was set for sten@@ cils for sten@@ cils , which is reflected in the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder , updated the preview of the sten@@ cils . &quot;
&quot; under review , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image . &quot;
&quot; enlarge : this button is magni@@ fied the underlying image . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; smaller : this button becomes smaller among the underlying image . in case you want to apply the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you must rot@@ ate the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse kno@@ b . &quot;
move : use this button to move the picture under the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
&quot; OK , if you want to apply the template on your picture . the image will then be customized to the original size . &quot;
digi@@ tised : presents three different tools to the fur@@ nace . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool to tigh@@ tening . it is very fast and easy , but it is especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images . &quot;
Un@@ shar@@ k mask has been working at the contrast of the edges to look for a picture . actually it &apos;s not a bit more mental to remove it and it makes it a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken out of Gimp and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
&quot; focus is possibly the best of the three , because he really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters for adaptation . &quot;
photos without focus and most digit@@ alized pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is due to the digit@@ alization process colors with only minimum differences . the same phenomenon can be observed when dy@@ es are printed on paper . SLR cameras usually require more down@@ scale shar@@ pen@@ ing as normal cameras for the private users .
&quot; in JP@@ EG @-@ images often a camera of internal sc@@ ams have been applied . pictures in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner always apply a sc@@ rolling , already during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able this de@@ activate , you will get in control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the sc@@ rolling value . this can call you with the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; you should be careful with caution , as the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges . in general the need to focus on the menu navigation . you can also achieve further information and a comparison of all techniques for the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is cris@@ p . the solution , the image has a little soft to draw , is considerably easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft drinks with the menu button Kor@@ rigi@@ d soft@@ ness and experiment with something with settings . the pres@@ umes on the right side of this dialog will show you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mask is a very good tool to remove v@@ eil from your photos . a demonstration can see you here .
the original image and preview help edit the image . the pre@@ f@@ ables shows the issue of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the standard values often produce good results and should first be tried out . an increase in radius or the amount will strengthen the effect . if you make the in@@ sharp@@ ness mask too strong , rou@@ gh@@ ing and the impression of gr@@ ats in the proximity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radio . you should therefore raise images best in their final resolution .
the amount will be added to the percentage between the original and the missed image one of the original is added . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is placed .
&quot; the pig value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference difference . one can thus define a minimum difference in this way , in this way areas with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ es , and therefore beauty faul@@ ts in faces , cel@@ ains and se@@ ab@@ surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mask . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the advertis@@ ed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a spon@@ ge = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool Re@@ focus is focused on an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected de@@ duc@@ tive filter algorith@@ m from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool seeks a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ us@@ eren@@ quot ; in which it focuses on a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filters . this is a better approach than just trying the picture to shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is used to start a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filters . it is used to launch better results as bl@@ ur@@ red mask . you can launch it from the menu by setting colors and focus on the picture editing .
&quot; in practice the circular catch is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which led the mathematical result also from the original pix@@ el . the F@@ IR Vienna in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung is even influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pix@@ el . that causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular loop : this is the radius of circular catch . it is the most important parameter to use this module . for most images the default value should put good results . you can put a higher value if your picture is bl@@ ur@@ red then however on Heiligen@@ sch@@ eine .
&quot; cor@@ relation : an increase in the cor@@ relation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.95 and thor@@ ns . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smoking filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can increase values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0,1 is very poor . if the noise filter is very bad . a hard value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will continue the picture even further . &quot;
Gau@@ ß &apos;s Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe . use this parameter if your un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sch is . in most cases you should use this value to zero in order to avoid violent arti@@ facts . if you have a value un@@ equal null , you might also need to increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ den noise filter . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ ri@@ ght@@ size : this value determines the size of the transformation size can produce good results , especially if you select great value for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow if you select great value for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the stor@@ ing and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any component of parameters you have set , will be saved for later and may be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try all the cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations are not immediately visible , but left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and com@@ press images , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ zi@@ pped image . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mask produces better results as sharp@@ ness . this could be causing this , the bl@@ ur@@ red mask has used a larger neighborhood as sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , it must be bl@@ ur@@ red masks always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters . it is practical , the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters are always at least as good as the Un@@ shar@@ k mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filters is often better in processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , based on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture was made using a analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto @-@ focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing and digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator Gl@@ ät@@ te sets the Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed of the parti@@ te area in order to create a natural pose .
&quot; the color tin@@ ent enables a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool definition error correction is one of the most widely developed tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with sp@@ y speed .
the In@@ painting algorith@@ m was developed by the Image team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains various preference settings as Star@@ points to simplify the restoration . the available settings are below :
&quot; if you want to use the filter settings , you can use the rider smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
detail preser@@ v@@ p &#91; 0 &#93; 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a more even@@ ly credi@@ ble over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be sharp . please note that the details will always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated in the direction of jud@@ gement .
&quot; right @-@ addiction Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value pu@@ zz@@ ling in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best viewed with a value in the vicinity of 1 . &quot;
smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 &#93; 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum Beli@@ ever factor above all en@@ qu@@ p defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value to the degree of smoking in your image .
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned greater structures . the higher the value is set , the more the geometry of the image is estimated . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ls &apos; effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorith@@ m is going through . usually it is enough 1 or 2 .
&quot; Win@@ kel@@ gradual integration &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : Win@@ kel@@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ en Alpha . if Alpha is small chosen , it should also be small to create a long term . you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to suit your needs . &quot;
integr@@ ale stri@@ width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : inclusive st@@ ep@@ width in pix@@ el . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pix@@ el smooth@@ ing and never bigger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More of quality you get through choice of this option is only small . he doubles but the term . we therefore recommend it out .
the buttons saving as and loading make exactly this . every setting of picture errors can be saved in a text file and will be loaded later again .
&quot; correct mistakes is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can see how images can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is set on a photo that is applied in Guatemala city with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black arti@@ facts in the foreground that is caused by a poor film stor@@ ing during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; smoking @-@ reduction is a very powerful tool to cut images . it uses a protected algorith@@ m by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool makes available machine filter available to remove patches and other arti@@ facts that are used for example of dust or hair on the lens , it can also be used to remove sensory fittings from the camera or mo@@ i@@ om@@ ute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information on sensory cameras from digital cameras , you can read it in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screens@@ hot top shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ny smoke that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain in default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) up to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time choosing the filter per pix@@ el and can be aston@@ ished by the picture and the color in it moves and thus minor bugs . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sc@@ rolling stock . this value sets the pix@@ el track down the filter down to determine the edges filter . you may need to change the edges filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter picture details can no longer be preserved and smoking or lubric@@ ate again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot be the whole smo@@ kes removed or smoke tips can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a watch@@ ful smoking or JP@@ EG @-@ arti@@ facts without losing details .
light @-@ proof : controls the lumin@@ osity of the image . we recommend either colour or light @-@ density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details of the settings .
color : controls the color toler@@ ance of the image . we suggest you either change colour or light @-@ density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details of the settings .
&quot; Gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas , which are typically stronger to increase . however , he also won the shadows . &quot;
&quot; shock absorption : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ tis@@ ation absorption . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter &apos;s variations on variations of illumin@@ ants . if it is increased , the edges can appear too high . he may remove rob@@ bers and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter to the edges . it can remove rob@@ bers and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; saving and loading : these buttons are used precisely for it . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) , and that corrected with ( 2 ) identified with default settings . &quot;
&quot; sometimes a picture is too scar@@ ed for your purpose . the solution that image to draw a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen@@ ing soft@@ rigi@@ d sof@@ tly and experiment with the smooth@@ est . the pre @-@ showcase on the right side of this dialog will show the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo checks .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove the Gau@@ ß &apos;s room , com@@ pression @-@ com@@ pression and local mistakes made in digital , original or subsequent digi@@ tised images that makes the content as well as the human eye . &quot;
the same algorith@@ m can be used for colour and textures . the text creation is done with another tool that is carried out by the Image team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ d and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the com@@ pression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of com@@ pression algorithms , it produces some com@@ pres@@ sions &amp; quot ; art@@ e@@ quot ; - small standards which are in un@@ com@@ pressed image . this setting should correct this problem . &quot;
the buttons saving as and loading make exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later be loaded again .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below you can reduce like a photo with uni@@ formity with uni@@ formity .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a minus ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous movie gr@@ itt on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and that corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that has been applied with a scanner . you can see the scan @-@ art@@ e@@ facts created by the scanning lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; it arrived ; tool Hot@@ pix@@ el allows you to remove Hot@@ pix@@ el of photos with a C@@ CD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project to be protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pix@@ el are especially among high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos a problem , as many cameras with JP@@ EG com@@ pression via an built @-@ built repression for hot pix@@ el . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ sub@@ tract method . there is currently no manual method to select the poor pix@@ el . &quot;
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the kno@@ b . the tool will be automatically recognis@@ able the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the educational background .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to absor@@ b the dark picture directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by C@@ CD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should find the appropriate dark picture to the corrected image . please note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and automatically invites you to the next meeting . &quot;
the image area and preview help you correct the result in the picture . the pre@@ f@@ ables shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all areas areas .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to cross this pix@@ el blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ing : it is defined an average of the neighboring pix@@ el . it is assigned to all def@@ ective pix@@ el in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this becomes extra for the horizontal and vertical line .
&quot; linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from Pix@@ el@@ block , are de@@ duc@@ ted to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ l the def@@ ective pixels of the block . &quot;
square : this is the default method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pix@@ el in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be cancelled to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pix@@ el in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pix@@ el correction to a color photo , of a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was increased at 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ tization is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , that is , under@@ p@@ ted corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; past@@ tw@@ ink@@ le lenses , especially the middle and large photo format , often the whole sensor area cannot be even@@ ly illuminated . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light to the sensor there . Tele@@ objective shows under circumstances also of this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he has also dis@@ advantages . many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 by bl@@ ending filter , which means that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wheat fl@@ ashing objective , also with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed effects arise by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the great loading of today &apos;s Fil@@ men@@ and the color @-@ scale ranges from digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ filters that has been applied without this filter . the tool Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ fier correction is protected by John Walker . &quot;
with three shelves you can control the vig@@ or filter coating and with three further exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light diff@@ use at the point of the largest density , the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and Gamma settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to rein@@ vent the loading of the target image with these options . regul@@ ators make you only positive values , as you only need to raise settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to create a hos@@ tile exp@@ ul@@ sion of the target image , so let the values for illumin@@ ant / double / Gamma at zero and use the Gr@@ ad@@ ation from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing from the menu color Gr@@ ad@@ ation . &quot;
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ tive picture . a lamp @-@ stronger and double correction was also carried out with the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; lenses show is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorith@@ m by David Ho@@ dson .
&quot; this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colored distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient of the second Gr@@ ades treat the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ verse form of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third dit@@ ades has a similar round effect , fl@@ acht but at the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
the Ko@@ efficiently fourth Gr@@ ades corrected the remote corners opposite to the second Gr@@ ades . if you combine these two can be almost eliminated any geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion .
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second atro@@ cities . with negative values , tonn@@ ages can be corrected and positive values of kis@@ sing distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the sm@@ ashed fourth Gr@@ ades . this value acts stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameters has changed the parameter &apos;s sign . &quot;
z@@ oom : this value scale the size code new and thus leads to the correction of the first di@@ ades through . negative values enlarge as positive as the image .
bright : this value regul@@ ates the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image into the corners while positive values they increase .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialogue with a preview correction correction . the values you use for your image , will be stored and used for the next start as default values . &quot;
the tonn@@ age or kis@@ sing correction should be performed before all cuts or size changes . at best perform this correction as all the first . in case you make a picture new to cut and then perform a tonn@@ correction would be the effect immediately apparent .
&quot; to help you find the best correction to you , this tool will display a vertical frequency . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . afterwards , you can correct the tonn@@ age with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a kis@@ sing distor@@ tion , the resulting picture of black corners . you can transform this with the cuts in the menu or remove it from the image processing or via z@@ oom Reg@@ ul@@ ators of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most images the tonn@@ correction is made . the next logical step for some motives , such as recordings of front , frame and painting , it is the perspective so to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees . please note that if you keep the camera with your hand , you will always keep an easy distor@@ tion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tonn@@ correction is applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method for simul@@ ating infr@@ ared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org Website that is accessed using this URL . the filter re@@ produces the famous Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film . this film has a sensitive range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
&quot; in the left of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can adjust two parameters to adjust film gr@@ itt and film @-@ sensitivity to a highly sensitive movie . the ISO controller changes the amount of film gr@@ itt and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green fields are white as snow !
&quot; since the filter shades used to reproduce infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel , makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color @-@ information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ ared filter is applied to a country photo of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the original picture under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the movie was placed on ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the high@@ lighting .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter film gr@@ itt is an easy to use tool to reproduce the fil@@ mm@@ et on your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed fil@@ ms like e.g. the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X to increase the sensitivity of the films .
&quot; the fil@@ mm@@ et effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere or appears to move back into the past . the treated picture gets loos@@ ed off from daily life . in case you want to use this specific , gallery , road photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you need to use this filters . &quot;
&quot; with regul@@ ator , the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the bodies are calibr@@ ated . the default value is , though often higher values need to be applied to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more bodies , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the fil@@ mm@@ et on a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity to ISO @-@ 1600 .
it came ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses the copyright protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like a oil painting . nature and st@@ umps are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five out . th@@ icker brus@@ hes are suitable for great pictures . smooth brus@@ hes controls the smooth@@ est or , from the other side , the hin@@ ge . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the original one is marked with the ( 2 ) . p@@ inch size for this 640 pix@@ el size is 1 and smooth@@ est 17 .
&quot; the digi@@ tization has been used ; filter carbon @-@ drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient in order to define a K@@ ohl@@ esk@@ ills . the lines that change the modifications in the drawing , are therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch . this would be good pictures to start . &quot;
&quot; there are two regul@@ ator with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top regul@@ ator chosen the pin size and lower the contrast , the contrast ( gl@@ ät@@ te ) . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the carbon filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result may be further improved by adapting the Intens@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it came ; filter engra@@ ving shows your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stopped in wax . it uses a protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization has come ; filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure where colour is not the most important thing . the filter does not use the differences between color and intensity , to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ astic landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast to the filter@@ ing . a value of 30 , corresponds 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the original image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter@@ ing group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tions . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and makes it look as if it is regarded by gl@@ ass@@ ing blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave @-@ blocks 1 the picture here is distor@@ ted in another version of gl@@ ass@@ ing blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel this effects at any time with the kno@@ b .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by Un@@ shar@@ k effects . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : ver@@ ur@@ ped the picture alongside ster@@ n@@ er@@ ous lines going on from a center . this simul@@ ated a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : wi@@ ped the picture by turning the pixels around a hub . this simul@@ ated the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
Rem@@ un@@ har@@ ness : caught the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to come back into the background .
&quot; movement sharp@@ ness : caught the picture by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ated the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera . &quot;
soft@@ ness un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : ver@@ ur@@ ped the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright notes . this makes photos with a dre@@ aming and sh@@ iny soft focus ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image characterized by random shift in pixels and simul@@ ated thereby the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a random camera . &quot;
intelligent Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and caught it without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , through the feeding with an average pix@@ el@@ worth , new . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation using the kno@@ b .
the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es are a nice small tool to make rain drops on your image . this gives it natural your pictures a n@@ est look . it used one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by protected algorith@@ m .
&quot; dri@@ p size allows to change the size of the drop . since the tro@@ pics size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture , it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . quantity changes the number and density of drops . fishing changes the op@@ tic effect of drops on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing a range free from reg@@ rop@@ es . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start after that the filter down , the area will remain free from reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . &quot;
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sun@@ down and the be@@ amed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; when the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it by mir@@ rors or rotating in the right orientation . the tools can be used in the menu and transform mir@@ rors . &quot;
photo tr@@ es is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a picture in a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to smaller is simple . the big question is , how can you keep a picture of bl@@ ackl@@ es , and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; when a photo has the wrong size , you can modify it to the desired size with the tool size . select the size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for the size may change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , such as spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlarge one image . it is used a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m photo was developed by the Image team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in a rider New size and are listed below :
&quot; the ratio is maintained : when this setting is activated , the content of the original size is maintained in the original size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned greater structures . the higher the value is set , the more the geometry of the image is estimated . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ls &apos; effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons save as and loading are used precisely to this . each setup for photo can be saved as text file and will be loaded later again .
&quot; photo infl@@ ated is very fast with what it does , but it may take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b . &quot;
you can see below an example of a picture below by clicking a small color picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard En@@ lar@@ ging to comparison .
&quot; cutting a picture is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to compile a picture . image processing allows this very simple . to cut a picture just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse and pul@@ ling the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle then you will see the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you get rid of the mouse button again , the area of the photos would be cut off . by doing so , you &apos;ll get a good overview of how your photo would look after listening . you can create the size of the right place by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle - simply by clicking with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the dis@@ section , use the button Select the mapping button in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save in the menu File to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in advance , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by move the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After side @-@ ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the format the larger value of height and width is assigned to the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool After land@@ ratio cut a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to select the selection automatically horiz@@ ont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; below in dialogue , you can use the Max . ratio kno@@ b the area to access the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cut @-@ ratio stores its settings depending on the orientation ( horiz@@ ont@@ ally or ver@@ tically ) . if you use the cuts into the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the modified image dimensions are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the original image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the assem@@ bling aid enable assistance to switch , so that you can put your images better together . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of similarity . as the third @-@ party , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility of sharing a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; Golden centre : the golden middle is a division which rises to various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of an Nau@@ til@@ us shells or the leaf leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it was already used among the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to put your temple and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects put together the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i eps . 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each figure is equal to the total of their two progres@@ sing numbers . a composition that is followed by this rule is considered vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the golden middle is liquid aid lines when you put an image together . these help will count down below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ als will bring your goal good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ party , the golden spiral , creates a liquid line with the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral , and creates a symmet@@ rical flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rect@@ angle of the golden spiral , also known as golden spiral . it should give something that the eye can be at the center of the composition . this can be a line or use different objects . this thing can just be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the Golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the top golden spiral lines . your ver@@ tices are the middle points of the sides of the golden tri@@ angles . take note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equ@@ in@@ duc@@ tive tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal of these lines can place a static object more dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles in order to cut your frame and create an effect of professional photographers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your cap@@ tion at one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve differently .
the options horiz@@ ont@@ ally reflect and vertical can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ious atten@@ tions .
&quot; with the button color , you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of lines with your current image . &quot;
the Free rotation is a tool to turn a picture to any angle .
&quot; when you make a picture , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horiz@@ ont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things turned around a angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing and tool free rot@@ ation ; select the target angle . &quot;
rot@@ ate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are set in degrees . with the kno@@ b pres@@ ets you can put the slide back to 0 degree . a preview of turning is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the module free rotation causes a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse to position the two lines with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , please click the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you shot a picture you will find unwanted three @-@ red holes in the corners . one way to repair this , it is the function transform@@ ing to utilize the image editing . &quot;
&quot; an elegant way to cut the image is its function Autom@@ atically . pick one of the following options : &quot;
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing the picture is a bit after the shooting . please note the above warning .
all per@@ si@@ veness trans@@ ations are provided by a fixed point in the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you must use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog box you will find some information which can help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty spaces that are created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces that are created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right up : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ former territory .
&quot; after adaptation of the perspective the image becomes a bit con@@ lubric@@ ated . for a single adaptation , this effect is small but two adjustments generate an twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after which you have adapted the perspective , you get unbe@@ atable tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to ber@@ some this is to cut it out the picture with transform into the image editing . &quot;
&quot; it is used to move a part of the picture into a direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal shot , e.g. becomes the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not rotation , a rect@@ angle is turning into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . you can start this module via transform@@ ers . &quot;
drag your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can push horiz@@ ont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press horizontal and ver@@ tically at once . a preview of the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target range will be shown on the right side of the area .
&quot; your assistance will be a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the vehicle tools to get your picture . &quot;
&quot; after having done the coating , the image becomes a bit embarrass@@ ed . for a single shot is this effect usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two vulner@@ abilities twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and so you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after shaving , the image has un@@ tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to remove it is the image with transform into the image editing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came to read and write a number of libraries and other packages to read and write them . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ elled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to provide a list of file formats on its system . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization ; shows only files in formats in formats . this happens based on file expand@@ able and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . in case the extension is listed in the image editing . you can change the file in the file editing . you can change this list of file expand@@ able cookies . please change the section configuration , you can find further information about this . &quot;
virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to select the user @-@ used format . a ful@@ ler description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports both formats .
&quot; expression is the application of data com@@ pres@@ sive connections on digital images . thereby , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on an efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , gl@@ atter@@ er results as JP@@ EG in the same com@@ pression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also be saved if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the raw material , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous landscape and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw material converter of &amp; digi@@ tised ; convert . in the section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which entered in &amp; digi@@ tization ; all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ tization ; are supported : &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often stored in Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . but this formats and will look for the movies . &amp; digi@@ tised ; however , there is no @-@ built options to view or edit . if you click on a film file and digi@@ tization ; settings to play movies to play the program to play . &quot;

&quot; when you exchange steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initi@@ al contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four roles with the module white off . &quot;
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ tised ; contain . your description follows here .
&quot; all imaging tools such as ch@@ fur@@ nace , soft@@ marks , rou@@ gh@@ ness , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialog type that is applied to the current image before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture application ; in this dialogue : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress report shows the status of the filter on the current picture . on the left of it we allow five buttons to change the comparison of pre@@ dat@@ ors . these modes are :
ver@@ tically share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter in the area right of the selected area .
horizontal without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter in the area below the selection range .
ver@@ tically split . the left area shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview for the mouse not in front @-@ area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch to over@@ - and under@@ exposed colors . the colors used can be adjusted within the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse in the picture and want to see it on the part of the picture from which you can preview . preview in the left part of the dialogue will immediately be updated .
&quot; ( 5 ) : in the lower left corner , here is a help and the possibility to reset any buttons on your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be painted . &quot;
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the chosen image and is largely un@@ explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are provided by the EX@@ IF data if they are available .
this tab represents an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ Programme . you can push it off with the mouse kno@@ b . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse kno@@ b to drag a square . all pictures inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this is of course required that your pictures Geo @-@ data included .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for mach@@ ining from colour pal@@ ettes and to choose and use colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files , which are developed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be used either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and connected colors . &quot;
&quot; in a dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders according to files . &quot;
the c@@ ursor is displayed in the pall@@ et view . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
it shows on the color next . the color is described under the se@@ pt view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to use . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the c@@ ursor to move . afterwards , move the mouse with drag@@ ged left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ field Bei@@ m is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted into the c@@ ursor , the color is inserted either or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ write . this mode allows you to adjust if you choose the cross @-@ field under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be combined with the actions of copying , cutting and inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color follows three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color note , if another color is followed . if a further color is followed in the cli@@ p@@ board , can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the colour choices can be drawn with the mouse .
you can choose a color somewhere on the screen and then select in the color @-@ selection on the left @-@ hand side .
&quot; &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; programs , free layout programs . graphs are available in science , particularly in the computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program to visu@@ alize graphs &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programmes through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a K@@ DE program about the viewer of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; cold ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( such a change of graphs in &amp; Kate ; the graphs are new and represented in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; Kate ; to open or the graphs in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
&quot; loading big graphs ( currently there are problems for about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack , to present more than this k@@ not ) &quot;
&quot; other needed software : &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which brings the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs are required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the opening graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you launch &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; in this case the tool@@ bar will only open the icon and the ( blank ) list contains files . click the first icon to view the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screens@@ hot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the drawing . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse bike ( high and down without special dates , left and right at op@@ pres@@ sive and old ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graphs .
&quot; if the file has changed in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer , the following window is displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose if the graph will be re@@ loaded and if you want to change the change . &amp; k@@ graphical viewer , your decision will also be able to change . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item settings , setup , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , in the file browser or on the command line , you will have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , or to inv@@ ading the graph in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change this with the furnishings . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both and later . &quot;
&quot; you can also define how the Grap@@ h can be divided into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical pages may be chosen freely . &quot;
&quot; when you use several pages , you can choose if the parts of the graph@@ ite that will be set on one side . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages might not be filled from the respective sections of the graph . &quot;
side @-@ show with one on several pages distributed Grap@@ h without head@@ line and with another font .
&quot; the site again shows the opportunity to determine the behavior if a file has been altered on hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a standard behavior ( automatically loading or ignore the changes ) or the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the page opening gives the opportunity to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; you can specify a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window , or determine in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is consul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the site management system gives the opportunity to set the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; you can set up a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) , or determine whether you need to be requested . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually happens with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose from different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or historical depic@@ tions of judicial graphs . the algorith@@ m puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few cant@@ een cuts . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ just grap@@ hing . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ ual model . it is used by the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorith@@ m that is syn@@ onymous with statisti@@ cally multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP , algorith@@ m is created for un@@ just Grap@@ h a spr@@ int @-@ spr@@ int model . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ mo@@ ur@@ ers for the treatment of large and g@@ ec@@ lu@@ ster graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorith@@ m uses the k@@ not circular , according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams by multi @-@ cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layer command , which is then executed by a shell , and the calculated layout of graphs according to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such layout command you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms special options , or even the graphs with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graphs ( directed or un@@ just ) and turns the standard algorithms for the respective type in ( dot ; for proj@@ ections , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ just graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed if this is needed . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; shows the What is the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor , click on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get further assistance to this item ( if available ) . &quot;

&quot; the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG @-@ video , with a defined length , to convert . this module is used to add a base transfer . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; all pictures will automatically select the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a back@@ color for the sli@@ deshow . in addition , you can create a back@@ color for the sli@@ deshow . with this module , it is possible to create a back@@ color for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; you must first select the pictures to the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au , and then you can launch the module via extras , MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . &quot;
the images selected by you are then en@@ umer@@ ated under images in the portfolio . there you can also change sor@@ ting of images or the content of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should be able to adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is set up and is probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds that will indicate the image below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot;
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should let them black . the names and the path of the generated file can be set under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the En@@ gra@@ zing mp@@ g .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then it is integrated into the film . after you have adapted to your preferences automatically , you can go back with the button of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer you can go back quickly or in all the rest of your computer , you can enjoy the sli@@ deshow when you &apos;re back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the button below . &quot;
the printer assist@@ ent allows you to print multiple images on a sheet paper together in standard photo@@ electric sizes . this is e.@@ g : useful to enhance you or print with the Gimp module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your in RA@@ W format , in one of three formats JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line @-@ tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave coff@@ in . an original version of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software used by your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can see the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now optimize the values newly j@@ us@@ ting to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings for the white can be used . the main parameters such as Gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be displayed . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later . &quot;
a four @-@ colors R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in the R@@ GB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview result , you can choose one of the three output formats and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a lu@@ st@@ air algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the tagged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , keeps all the information of your image and uses the lu@@ cr@@ ative L@@ Z@@ W com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to process your pictures frequently or otherwise you should otherwise click on to use the JP@@ EG format , since it &apos;s only a limited number of operations permitted before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG as storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata are included in the RA@@ W file in the JP@@ EG file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button again . if you want to cancel this process again , you can break down . &quot;
&quot; the stack mode allows you to convert different pictures at once . use this mode for sure , for example , by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the settings available are virtually identical with the version for individual pictures . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write this file . a preview is not available . a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to transm@@ itter all images in one album . it uses the program to convert the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting point and the tim@@ est@@ amp can be used . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several pictures of a collection collection . it uses the program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can make the picture smaller or enlarge .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image @-@ orientation , selected . the ratio is left unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : magnitude change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your picture to the screen format .
not proportional : dis@@ proportionate sizes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed during this option .
&quot; print preparation : preparing the picture for the photo printing . the user can adjust the resolution and size of the phot@@ op@@ api@@ ers . the target image , inclusive background size , random size and background color , is accordingly adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of additional pictures beforehand . you can draw further pictures to the list of images below .
&quot; after having started the module , the picture window with the pictures selected will be displayed . via the button pictures you can add further pictures with a file @-@ dial dialog . for the most recently chosen picture , a preview display is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also take pictures on the picture list and put it in order to add you to the list of images .
with the kno@@ b images remove the selected pictures from the list of suitable images .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window to your e @-@ mail clients . you just need to add the addresses and the subject box . the pictures selected by you are already attached to an attachment .
do not respect too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of sen@@ ing e @-@ mails . it may possibly be a good idea to send several mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for the sending of images . your configuration is saved and every@@ time used until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify in the input field below the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; in case you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the election of comments in a attached file , the comments to the pictures are inserted in a text file , and the mail attached . &quot;
&quot; the PN@@ G format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use PN@@ G if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality is not going to be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG under images file format , and the original files in JP@@ EG format are then the original export data are added to sen@@ ing images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically closed so you can watch the status testim@@ onials , in search of errors , see . your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . with the kno@@ b . let this window have to lie ? en . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module &apos;s advanced di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want your sli@@ deshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation use very elegant image transi@@ tions using OpenGL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card since otherwise , the sli@@ deshow will be very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ame option display that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images shown in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an end@@ los@@ ure . you can manually break it manually with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly choose to choose that the images are displayed in an acci@@ dental order . so it is not used in order of the images in the album .
under del@@ aying between pictures can be set the temporary distance between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . you should do so before you show the presentation of your friends ! &quot;
there is more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . random@@ ly sel@@ ects a transition between pictures and another effect .
&quot; during the sli@@ deshow , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off . &quot;
&quot; with this work@@ top , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current date name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; date j@@ us@@ ks still has no documentation . in case you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to put an image as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module shows the currently selected picture , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your K@@ DE work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , you are now in every group , thus in people , places and in the group key@@ word entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories , for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course to view the current preliminary pictures . in the following each one is described for themselves . &quot;
&quot; when you press with the mouse on the entry person , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select a further person will be displayed only the images shown on which both persons are shown . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images of a few thousand pictures on a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all individuals , places and other settings , you can view images to look at the images of your efficiency range . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined . see this picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images beside the names , select the button which is right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . please note that you can see for example symbols with images of people and simultaneously a list of key@@ boards ( if you do not have suitable images ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to decide which picture for every single person will be displayed . now , you can view the image editor as shown in the picture . here you can custom@@ ize the image for the corresponding person . in the cau@@ tious window you can custom@@ ize the magni@@ fying factor to your wishes and thus choose which part of the picture is to be displayed or cut . &quot;
&quot; when you go in the main window to enter the entry , a dialog will be shown where dialogue is very similar for fix@@ ing the image properties . this dialog can be viewed on the screen again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string into the box or description , the cap@@ tions or description of the images will be searched for . if you want , you can also use a date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however , not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but would rather like to try the features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick@@ set , the screens@@ hot and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help menu item for photo@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo will start a few sample pictures and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you would rather want to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you see here : as the name suggests , this cor@@ rid@@ ors shows you data statistics on the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different tim@@ ers . each one shows then another unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you will see a part of a database by showing the body only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the time limit can be used in the following ways : you can select the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date in preview display is displayed ) and the tim@@ eline is always shown the current date at the moment when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by clicking the mouse button , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select an area , you will review the selection , by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you two options available HTML @-@ websites with your pictures . one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as a module is available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual the version is described in HTML tags .
&quot; before HTML @-@ Pages , you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following each area will be described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the survi@@ vor@@ s and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album , HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , choose if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . nails information on export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . by this way , you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer . for example , that all pictures are exported to the viewer . for example , that all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain views . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clearly , so this is not specifically noted . &quot;
&quot; down on the page you can set various resolutions on the pictures . this way , those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images can download for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time , so you can modify your images with lower resolution , as well . if he wants to get a picture bigger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setup area , you specify the different folder and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , choose a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the main folder in which all your pictures will be saved . this folder is automatically saved and you can choose the location next time . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is all for viewer . if you have created a URL after the basic record , the URL you want to set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will be in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t need to copy it into the final target folder you need to copy it manually , so that the import function , see correctly , you need to specify the final goal of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folder are . &quot;
&quot; the set @-@ settings options are referred to all three on base folder or UR@@ Ls . in such a sub@@ folder , the name you specify in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you want to join a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may , of course , you might want to compile a HTML @-@ page to viewing the pictures , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work doesn &apos;t even have to do . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others to your database . the imaging characteristics are connected with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it if the images are stored within the file or if the file is only a link to the file , that you can have all the images added to the file and that file can be done so independent . the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or create a .@@ k@@ im file , together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the images in a two times . first , the images are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , dialogue for export images described above , which you can export via the menu file to be able to call . &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether to act in internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; in the Manual near the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atic , to copy the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the pictures are automatically for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images have already com@@ pressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is usually not worth to com@@ press the files . if you do not want this to easily select the option export file .
&quot; the last option of this site is a maximum size limit . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the images in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file otherwise might be very large . here you can limit the size by example , that each image is to be a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Im@@ por@@ ters ... select , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; your assistant is made up of four steps . first , you have to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are the category individuals who are to be imported within the category ( if you are a D@@ oom ) , while this category is called in your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialog box which are imported to the imported file and which categories will comply with your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can extract the categories of the following file using the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse and look at : when you see pictures , you often want to see pictures of your Italy vacations and discover a picture with your friend to discover , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will take the various steps from ( 1 ) to place the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the passage and prestige , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ tations . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program to the ni@@ ghtly of your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this hand@@ book will be talked about pictures , but frequently they also closes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all his information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file , which you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and used this at future starter . if you want to read another folder in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example : k@@ photo@@ album with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; on the menu introduc@@ tory settings k@@ photo@@ album ; up to a window , you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user &apos;s manual , you will explain the different settings . &quot;
&quot; to the left you see six different symbols , with which you can view settings for viewing and the options for the viewer . for each setting , you can call a detailed help to enter the F1 button and click on the option you want . &quot;
&quot; it was described in you how you can set up different properties for each photo , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog , which is used to already edit existing groups . for every existing group you can select a marking and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialogue options , you can set up complete member@@ groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group look at once in a group instead of explained all groups of a medi@@ gli@@ eds as in . &quot;
&quot; in view of the settings options available to you for fix@@ ing the members of the list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right list of the sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
&quot; the modules may be called through the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; they are distributed separately . however , most modules have a help @-@ page that you can call on the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules can be shared among each other with each other , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you should first test your own pictures using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album Demo &lt; ? \ &gt; or via the menu Help . say not , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , which allows it to be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the down@@ side if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their images in albums : there &apos;s an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ated it for some modules the order according to albums so you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; there is simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the images that show you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album I have to pass on &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules can also pass a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category you set in the dialog dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you use for example the category individuals , will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you would have chosen to see person and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove it from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and choose the modules that modules are loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a start@@ up screen , once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see quite a menu and a tool@@ bar . at the tool@@ bar you see the window as you do not have any information about your pictures . in the section , you will find no information about your pictures , now please click on the entry images , showing you an overview with all the available pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , where the image has been added , and you can put any image either separately or for a larger number of pictures selected at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured , and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for search and brow@@ sing , as you can read in paragraph , if you want to see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you will see three lists with a text box by giving people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use it again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the moving pictures within the list : if you have for example a family party and shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , so that the used names can be moved to the top that you can find and assign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting out date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected any notes on each image separately , you may need to edit all the selected images and add these pictures with notes . click in this case simply on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. by the same person , then it can be more convenient to highlight all these pictures and add the menu item additional items to once with a comment . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California all lie in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you will see a browser window that shows the US as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is indicated . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the connection type , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new version or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also drag an entry into a category and put there in order to drag this into a sub@@ category of this entry . warning that you are exactly using your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the mark@@ er , by forming the cor@@ rid@@ ors that form the edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by taking it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs , you click on the button options ... , which allows you to save the current structure and look of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame completely out . if you want to get this window again later , use the button options ... and then enter window a / off . this procedure will see you in the picture . &quot;
&quot; select the entry images in the browser , you will find an overview with description of the currently selected images , or any pictures in case you have no filters . an example can be seen here . you can configure the size of the umb@@ nails , by simply set drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . just try it . &quot;
&quot; if you have a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background picture for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture . if you have not opened a window with a picture , a new indicator becomes created . &quot;
you can delete images in the image @-@ show . simply select the appropriate pictures you want and press either the removal button or select in the Edit selection menu . now the window will be shown you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use it with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use it anywhere on your hard drive . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard disk .
&quot; images , in which the right upper turn is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for example , the images 5 @-@ 9 are available , so that you can see the images below . however , you can also view these images with the image . &quot;
&quot; as you see this function , you need to copy files from folders and then copy it . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not want to avoid touching the corresponding CD right now , please purchase a larger disk in order to save all the images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy if you want to make a little more privacy and click on the menu . alternatively , you can also select all the pictures that can see your little sister , cont@@ eu@@ ws and the menu @-@ entry fit all but up @-@ to @-@ date view . &quot;
&quot; you have set what pictures in the case of the case should be hidden . if you want to block the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu rede@@ em images , which you have locked , hidden . if you want to get the pictures again , click on Sper@@ l . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set up a password which must be entered to un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture protection is by no means very secure . for example , you can read and delete all the images on the disk . this type of password protection serves only for those who are working with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason you want all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to see them at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for this reason it has a picture _ and video &apos;s . you can preview the P@@ review , as described in . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can see the viewer . he will of course see the image , but additional all the information you enter via the image , such as who is in the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box on the top of the picture you want to see , so you can track it easily with the mouse . you can also configure the information available on the viewer . all these options are available after a legal click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here on the browser , see what you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and jump back by using the keys picture high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with at pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then a new image invites you to press the Str@@ g button and Plus or minus . it will run and hal@@ ted the sli@@ deshow by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful skill of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full @-@ mode mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch in full mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can easily walk into the picture and out of z@@ oom . to Her@@ cul@@ o@@ oms you can easily re@@ configure a rect@@ angle . with the Min@@ us button , the plus button zo@@ om@@ t is in the middle of the picture . shows how an z@@ oom @-@ rect@@ angle marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the picture is not zo@@ omed to zo@@ om@@ t . by the equation below the zo@@ oms , so each pix@@ el matches the screen of a pix@@ el of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations have the videos that work in and out of zo@@ oming , with the plus and using the key . &quot;
&quot; using the turn@@ tables from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the actual picture with the menu item from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it may happen that you &apos;ll find an image with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the picture and configuration dialog of the picture , but you &apos;ll be able to highlight the picture and look at the picture . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad , while at one view one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above gives you the viewers the opportunity to show pictures with features , while you view them . features include the letter A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter . you see an image where the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set signs on your pictures , these are available to you in the browser . so you can see all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so just add all the pictures to copy the pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and particularly characteristics can be displayed in the pre @-@ view view . if you can view different categories in the pre @-@ view view , you can simply push the letters to the pictures after watching the image . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
&quot; the old is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can revers@@ al your mind later . &quot;
&quot; in turn , you can see a picture on the painted picture . to turn the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the painting paint from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply put the cross at the tool@@ bar top on the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you have to master the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the area @-@ tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and the object shown in the Dra@@ ht@@ mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also choose several objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects have already been selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon at the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu introduc@@ tory menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu ends , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with Del@@ ete either from the menu bar under Bear@@ ings , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene before . &quot;
&quot; if you have altered properties , click on to apply these changes . have invali@@ d values entered , it will correct a message with a fault description . then you can click to apply the input files and to apply the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation in the furnishings , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the indicated object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if these documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview of the property . &quot;
&quot; press review in the peculi@@ arity view and a small example of the scene will be displayed with the chosen texture . as default , the total texture is sign@@ posted , even if you want to have a sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example , a texture within a texture @-@ map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally . &quot;
the screens@@ hot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag this check@@ points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wi@@ re@@ model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the whole window . &quot;
every object has a visual model as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their view@@ points of small or equal representation of the point of view of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the view of the properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the default window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can also adjust it to any number of windows and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window via or under a present view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of one view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over each other , drag the starter in the middle of another view . you can then move between the views by clicking on the kart@@ ing card in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last potential window order are swe@@ eping views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view out of anch@@ oring , drag the starter on the desktop or click the little left top to the top not@@ ch in the box . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the bar . to prevent the closing picture , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu View , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are swe@@ at@@ ingly , you can anchor it to any point . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can be saved with a window of window order . it is displayed in a dialog , where you can store the window order under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ own them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual has been written , was &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ders the current scene , click on the Symbol Ren@@ ate The Symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item for the menu . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode matches the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in various image sizes and quality levels , you can add as many ra@@ i@@ ding modes , from a quick preview to full pictures . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... choose , the following dialog will be open : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can type any name , but it is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size , you can apply the width and height of the desired image . if you only want to ren@@ own a small area of the picture , select the cross section section and enter the picture @-@ section to ren@@ ders into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ field quality you can select the properties that uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for rendering , this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refl@@ ector . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user &apos;s manual to &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; when a picture is given with just a beam of pixels , there can be different mistakes . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or material effects in cur@@ ves and lines , sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pix@@ el . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . in general , pictures with this characteristic feature better . &quot;
&quot; if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam of pixels . this technique means super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the adjacent pix@@ el with one refers ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because every pix@@ el is split up again and adap@@ tive because the record @-@ sion@@ ers of the calculated colors depend . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method to choose POV @-@ Ray a beam . when the difference between color values can be dealt with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the lowering of a certain extra number of pix@@ el with super @-@ sampling . if you are charged the lowering of 4x@@ 4 additional points , at a low level of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixels . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pix@@ el will be calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pix@@ el , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pix@@ el . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays depending on the pix@@ el . if the difference between the color @-@ level threshold transc@@ ends , then the pix@@ el is divided into 4 sig@@ pix@@ el , which can be followed individually and tested on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be used with the repository . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the beams for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; to calculate the diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to charge a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this card , you can set whether the Alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pix@@ el is then transparent if the related beams do not have an object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ Con@@ sol@@ en@@ code . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ Sc@@ ene , select the menu item import , and choose a file in the dialog box . &quot;
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; yet not the complete command of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if in the import error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window shows a list of all the messages . &quot;
if you do not want to support code text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ ay@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can export objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds to the source text of the object in the pre @-@ opened text file in the editor , just highlight the source text in the editor and drag it into the box . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert sources for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also in your editor .
&quot; the POV @-@ Ray command is called , if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , is one scene . usually , this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the help in your own view , it opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . place here the path to your document and the version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ der data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files in the folder of the scene , you must also include the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire @-@ models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the viewing field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type characteristic .
&quot; you can adjust the object of points to the push @-@ button in the context menu of the wire model . you can set the buttons separately for shifting , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values give a more accurate wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the shown objects , but require more time to rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the details level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you select the high level of details for advanced proj@@ ections , all the wi@@ re@@ model views are further divided as the camera is an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the right proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to rendering . &quot;
&quot; if you select a wall , a wall behind the objects is sign@@ posted . the wall is displayed in a chess board mu@@ ster from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the floor , a ground below the objects is sign@@ posted . the soil is displayed in a chess board mu@@ ster from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate the cant@@ een , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and weak@@ ening can be set . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can modify existing window systems or create new window systems . in the window of window applications , you can create and store windows . &quot;
the Com@@ mod@@ est@@ field standard window order : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list available window arrangements shows all existing window systems . a new arrangement allows you to create the button using the button below and delete a selected order using the button .
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views for the chosen window order . new views can make you delete and selected views with the button below .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column create a new column on the right of the existing window , with un@@ lock the window below the existing window , with box card , you will not see a map view along with the previous view and we@@ aving the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; you have just installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start with no more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene with beginners : a bul@@ let on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully observe the following war@@ nings , before you complain that you get as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for example , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you are not setup camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you receive a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not fit light sources , lies your whole scene in the dark and you get only a black picture . &quot;
if you have everything error @-@ free you see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window order :
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so you can expect an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; these menus and symbols are often used now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry insert . thus , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model shows how the camera views the whole scene which you produce . in particular , this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree contains now a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of the view Properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; just change the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera will change in the view control points , with which you can change the way@@ point of the camera . simply click on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you apply the button or press En@@ ter , the wire model views and the object @-@ tree immediately change to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could for example insert a p@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a comprehen@@ sible method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a easier option . you can employ an infinite level as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button Select or the input table . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the spiral @-@ model shows now also the level , alb@@ eit in the moment only as a limited final plane . if you ren@@ own the scene , the level extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you view the object tree exactly , you will notice that you click the entry to the bottom . in this case you will see the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the ground to exercise a unity among the horiz@@ ont@@ aneous line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and place the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; only choose the ground out to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select at the moment somewhat unusual . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog will open in which you can select how the object is inserted . please select First Command@@ ment . you can see the name in the property View ( name = soil @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button @-@ preview , see how the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows an Matt@@ es black material because you have to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . just think that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities but take now the easiest ways . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the ground is right now . if you kick your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following results : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . you will need to enter two new attributes . in the color list , you have to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the Chess@@ board price list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; select in the object tree jed@@ es@@ mal , and change the colors in the view of the properties . &quot;
&quot; this step should you be able to run already , as you should have understood the fundamental working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; however , the ball is just as easy as the floor to create : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the Properties Properties , you can immediately change the settings . bet the value for radius : on 1 ( do not forget the En@@ ter or the button ) , so that the ball over the ground fluctu@@ ates , since you have moved the bottom to one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now yiel@@ ds a wei@@ rd result : as before , appears the ball @-@ surface like an Matt@@ es black material . put the next step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; when you have selected the sphere , you can now assign a material . as already in the ground , enter the bul@@ let a pig@@ ment as a colour : &quot;
&quot; select First sub@@ object and change the name for example in the sphere pig@@ ment . click the sphere pig@@ ment , select then resour@@ ce@@ ful and place the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more interest@@ ingly , if you take the time to set some Finish properties : &quot;
&quot; then change the values as in the following screens@@ hot , and click on the button or press En@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the settings she@@ en effect and reflection are already partially visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not even selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; hopefully you have learned so much , that you can easily create , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ ay@@ sis is a ration@@ ale method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you give a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ks , the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical stran@@ ts from the perspective of the beh@@ older ( i.e. from the camera , which indicates the scenes ) through the objects reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects will operate in the scene and how atmospheric effects will affect pixels . this way the scene is processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you can also see nothing , the image is to be displayed , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file expand@@ ability * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc . &quot;
&quot; open a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open a new model , or create , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and location . &quot;
&quot; once again , the scene has recovered in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected . &quot;
&quot; this menu items can only be selected , if you have not stored any changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeated the last modified command . this menu entry can only be selected , if you have used mach@@ ining . &quot;
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for hi@@ ring &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard abbrevi@@ ations . you can modify or add new commands to this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove with this option tool signs for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; commands and remove commands .
&quot; B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to pre@@ fers rough surfaces , without having to model each ben@@ ds on the surface individually and without the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic body are simple geomet@@ rical shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will then continue to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
&quot; a texture @-@ map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pix@@ el base , by applying an image file as a color card . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ku@@ il@@ show ; is a comfortable picture , and navig@@ ator . the application has a file browser , in which you can choose images to display . &quot;
images can either be displayed in your own window in the size of the picture or in full mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ k@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files which you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button return .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in your own window or if all the images are always using the same window .
&quot; if you search for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the file in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right lower corner . if a suitable fil@@ en@@ ame appears , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pushing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ il@@ show ; there are five boxes cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can adjust the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short sub@@ commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; if the picture is selected , then the images are opened in full mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can adjust further down . pres@@ et is not a full mode . &quot;
&quot; is this point activated , loads &amp; ku@@ il@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still check the current picture . this reduces the delay , when you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for a sli@@ deshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ k@@ ick@@ show ; when selecting the name of the most recently opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a back@@ color . this is used in to fill the background of the screen in full mode . if in the window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can show &amp; ku@@ k@@ ick@@ show ; so set up , that only some of the file types will display which the program can also be displayed . &quot;
with this option is enlarged for great pictures the scor@@ eboard to the full screen . this option is switched as default .
sets out whether the sli@@ deshow is to start with the first image in a folder or with the selected picture .
&quot; the time span between image change at a sli@@ deshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der and the small arrows right next to the input field . the default setting is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ ps . this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow is repeated until they are broken down by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der and the small arrows right next to the input field . the default setting is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the maps of shor@@ tw@@ ave for the scor@@ eboard and short @-@ command for the browser .
&quot; with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;

&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo shooting based on the &amp; digi@@ tised ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ tised ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick picture editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and modifications .
&quot; as the rest of &amp; k@@ de , is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends that the user contributes to its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; you can also find a dialog with a link . if you are also in the program , the menu provides an entry with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page for reports of problems and wishes . all necessary information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to indicate your message . &quot;
&quot; the show@@ photo is a project supported by a community . that is , that users and developers can help each other . if you are looking for a more common user of &amp; show@@ photo . however , in this mailing list , you will soon be able to answer any questions or other users . in this mailing list , you should be able to have this language so powerful . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . guidance to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; &quot;
&quot; the show@@ photo ; tries to give you as much control over his work @-@ flows as possible . there are many options that can choose the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; you will be able to select to settings in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of loading indicator , you can select the color which is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposed indi@@ k@@ ator should show the colors with what you should display , the contrast should be a bright color and over@@ exposed a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar on the right edge that puts you important information and actions to the selected images . the same side@@ bar you can also find in the image editing . you can view it , in which you can click on one of the five hor@@ semen : &quot;
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for inser@@ tion of images that are no longer power as images to scan and dis@@ appointments .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application for scan of pictures that do not make more than pictures to scan and dis@@ appointments . it can be saved for every picture to save a dialog box and save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the pictures from storage .
you can check the status of support of your Sc@@ ena on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not displayed or if no standard scanner is indicated , then a dialog will be opened to choose the scanner . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner scanner and press OK to open the scanner . cancel it , stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite . &quot;
the further settings contain more det@@ a@@ illed options of driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
&quot; to view a picture , the user can only start a Vor@@ sch@@ can and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the pre @-@ payment can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the picture , the user can into the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . he can also adjust the z@@ oom in the window . &quot;
if the picture was chosen then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if before saving a preview display in the settings , then the image is displayed in a showcase , as shown below is displayed . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a break@@ down and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the kno@@ b settings , the same @-@ term dialogue will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the picture if desired , before saving . in this case , the option should be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images stores . dialogue for stor@@ ing every picture opens the dialog before any given picture . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to ask for without a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this option defines where the pictures are stored in the option saving without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as default for dialogue to store . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture fix for the automatically re@@ ten@@ ded pictures and is moreover the proposed name for the picture in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets highly counted , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the quality user @-@ saving quality . this value also changes the com@@ pression value in store . if Cho@@ ose the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the kno@@ b help starts the K@@ DE @-@ help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ Manual . the kno@@ b About starts the K@@ DE dialogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialogue for the settings and locks can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of this pump@@ ing and their function . the global button @-@ mouse can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select Glob@@ alization button ... click here .
&quot; you may set up existing multimedia keys so that they are working as &amp; AMAR@@ OK , short @-@ command . this way , make your keyboard to the &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; control center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions which are mostly also found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , players , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function could look &amp; eg ; look like this : &quot;
AMAR@@ OK supports the command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de . in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ options .
&quot; you should give the user a message when the script should not be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script , whether all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user tag , why a script does not run . &quot;
in require &apos; Res@@ un@@ dum &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Cor@@ in@@ dum ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is called for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / Hostel you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as basis for your own scripts , or you can easily expand the functions required . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P your scripts can be controlled with amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be attached to any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
most scripts enable the execution of external programs and commands . in this way the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this reason , script should constantly monitor the default script and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events if there is no use of it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to view the furnishings dialog . to save the stor@@ ing and loading of the furnishings must take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok will put the work@@ folder on the folder , where all data should be saved . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ aled that a new piece is being spar@@ ked . the script could now ask &amp; eg ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the cl@@ erg@@ es ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le , Con@@ vert the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu item can be used . to remove an entry again d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; stop , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to do e.g. au@@ spices . this signal includes saving data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ oks script management can also install script packages , which has downloaded the user &amp; eg ; downloaded from a web server . we recommend a archi@@ v@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly identify the archive clearly as a Amar@@ e@@ script package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extensive amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right correctly . &quot;
&quot; the main feature must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining for lad@@ der modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to receive the file right : &quot;
&quot; when your script is finished , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org page and the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; apply for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the category AMAR@@ OK ; script . &quot;
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de , . &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; AMAR@@ OK , you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you are looking for a very specific title of thousands of thousands of your collection . with &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; &apos;s collecting browser and the quick@@ search will be found within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist will always be hard for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; AMAR@@ OK has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . this and many more useful features make Amar@@ ok for the most advanced audio player . AMAR@@ OK is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to rein@@ stall your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one has to enter the Fol@@ ders of Amar@@ ok sources , in order to compile Amar@@ ok and install : &quot;
&quot; because &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aker , you should have no difficulty in getting any problems . if you encounter any problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; like most applications some options that can enable or dis@@ able to activate the configure script via the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies must be fulfilled , so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activated Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; AMAR@@ OK , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is available without difficulty of the furnishings . the furniture dialog has several boxes to set up the various features of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ;
&quot; player windows are viewing the player window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists ( sho@@ wn@@ it@@ .@@ K ) . &quot;

&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , the relative paths to the music files , from the storage location of the playlist , use the absolute position of the music files . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; the piece is to be visible in the piece of change , the play@@ lists of the play@@ lists are on the window , in order to keep the current piece always in the invisible window area . &quot;
&quot; switching to the context of the context browser displays the context @-@ browser automatically , as soon as the next piece is all@@ u@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; however , the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the fonts section you can use the use of different fonts in &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; you can use fonts for the following section : playlist window , player windows and context browser . press to choose ... , so you can choose a type of type out of the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom colour scheme , you can choose the tor@@ ment of choice and can specify a private color scheme . use the color shades for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; start playing with the start , that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; after the program start playing the play automatically with the play at the point , with which they stopped when the last box was stopped . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display device allows you to switch off the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this review . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the font . click on &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; to select from the dialog the desired let@@ art for the O@@ SD . the cross @-@ field shadow brings that the text in O@@ SD is sh@@ aded . &quot;

&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as , eg ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the features and the gallery with screens@@ hot . &quot;
&quot; AMAR@@ OK needed only the package K@@ delicate and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the included in them , because as modules or scripts ) , we have written a small manual , how to make K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features such as O@@ SD permits the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work so , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support AMAR@@ OK on all platforms , so we use K@@ delicate and Q@@ t because these represent an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can fin@@ alize the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report the cap@@ ut@@ te file to the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
mostly this is that day lib when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b @-@ developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is something mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all by &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version were compiled . if for example , B. &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , this leads to pl@@ unge in the editing of met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able autom@@ aton if in@@ active for ... in the setting of the Sound System , or do not use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email automatically opens in a crash ) . if it is a common crash , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that many program data is stored as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but it does not identify as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script shifts the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / perl the &apos; $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ day = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ day ; print &apos; error in writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ day ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ E &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; s symbols in the stat@@ us@@ bar ( random smo@@ other ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can fix the tool@@ bar under appearance symbols and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting will show its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ lock symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map . this can be viewed with ld@@ d &apos;@@ Her@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; in order to remedy these errors , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ fy Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf , that AMAR@@ OK the correct version first finds . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems must be resolved through the help of an expert your Uni@@ or or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # AMAR@@ OK .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter there only one error if you are interested in solving a defect in AMAR@@ OK .
&quot; after the start of &amp; AMAR@@ OK , only a blank playlist will be released . how do music pieces come from there ? &quot;
&quot; this is easy . use the file browser on the left side , and open the folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start @-@ window has been converted into the statisti@@ c window . you find it among extras . &quot;
&quot; the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the review through the user , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate specimen , must be displayed in the playlist of the playlist , and select column rating . click anywhere in the new App@@ ly column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short@@ cut @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press withdraw@@ als on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from playlist removed from the menu @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file using mouse to playlist , and let them drop exactly as you would do it with other files . so simple is that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , just next to the add @-@ button , you can save the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
presum@@ ably you will lack the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; new . check out also for lib@@ visual , this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . also you will find it via the menu bar under extras ...
&quot; none . yes , this really true ! no ! &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used one from the back@@ end @-@ independent approach , so the actual question of the media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / b@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can support this pretty much every single audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and PN@@ G ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! perhaps use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with what do not be delivered in the default setting no MP3 @-@ de@@ coder . the solution : alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Sub@@ ab@@ et@@ aste &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; Play MP3 &apos;s starting : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ stre@@ amer drivers with the AL@@ SA @-@ S@@ ink , the device needs to make a mix@@ er . a bl@@ ender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be easily accessed by the d@@ mix -@@ module for AL@@ SA . take a look at the support of the D@@ mix for AL@@ SA . &quot;
the output of this command should help you in finding the problem and help a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( for example ) .
&quot; the doing &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; already . do not forget that media must first de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is for most people the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can be purchased directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest possible priority ( real time list ) and increase the size of the Sound @-@ Pu@@ ffer ( warning to see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per SU@@ ID is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ F co@@ dec@@ s that can cause bo@@ iler play@@ back . read this error report . enlarge the sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA sax@@ ophone file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ multimedia fully to receive the quick@@ est Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was greatly improved for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts Pu@@ ffer in the control center and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buff@@ ers , the less they react to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , thre@@ aten &amp; AMAR@@ OK . why ? &quot;
&quot; after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components , run G@@ ST register to register all the G@@ stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C @-@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( end AMAR@@ OK before ! ) : - Up@@ load your peg , compile and install it . if you locate the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ regi@@ sters again . start now &amp; AMAR@@ OK . &quot;

&quot; &amp; cd@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ o@@ fs ; it burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; cd@@ record ; has all functions which also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; offers , and enhanced these features even . therefore choose &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; usually reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , higher quality at burned audio CDs . &quot;
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Dis@@ cs Digital Audio ) . on the Internet these programs are generally described as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio coding and for dealing with audio data stream . O@@ GG requires open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ one@@ - and En@@ coder modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio dé@@ c@@ or . it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 @-@ de@@ coder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a far developed MP3 de@@ coder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used from the MP3 @-@ en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : an open source co@@ dec for lu@@ red audio com@@ pression and de@@ com@@ pression . it is used by FLA@@ C @-@ de@@ coder module and the external audio @-@ en@@ coder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; li@@ bs@@ w@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example , W@@ MA files to de@@ cryp@@ ted them to an audio CD . &quot;
SO@@ x : an auxili@@ ary program that can be used between different audio formats and convert . SO@@ x is used by the SO@@ x Audio En@@ coder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for the video processing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a well @-@ equipped car system to edit , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ sing video CDs and Super Video CDs . &quot;
&quot; standardi@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files on a standard level . this can be useful for example , to create rented CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different heights of the various albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces can be restored differently according to . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and to automatically display all videos in the basic record CD .
&quot; this is a convenient way , recently opened projects once again to load . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been stored , the file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save below is displayed with which you can select folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the file file .
&quot; saves all the open projects . that &apos;s the same , as if you would be saved for every single project file . &quot;
closes the current project . if a project changes and has not been saved if you want . you can then choose between stor@@ ing and changes . besides , you can also break down and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; closing all the planned projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for any not stored project , what should happen to happen , just as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; closing all the planned projects and ended &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project is consul@@ ted , which is to happen , as if you called the file . &quot;
&quot; when you go to this entry , you can choose the exact dialog files to add to the project . it has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the upper view into the project view . if the current project is a data @-@ CD , the add @-@ added files in the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog &quot; Br@@ ing &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only be opened , when the project has already been collected . &quot;
&quot; opens the properties dialog to the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What about the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry appears only with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you do files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful if you do not use files for multi @-@ professional meeting . it is intended for you to do so as help so that you can see the existing files and folders using the media .
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature illustr@@ ates files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove files from the medium , they fade only the files imported files again . &quot;
&quot; open the CD @-@ copying dialog . this allows also without project file to create a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also just get a picture of a CD instead of normal cop@@ ier . you should also prefer to copy cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; open the DVD Cop@@ y dialog . this allows also without project file to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also be able to burn just one image of a DVD , which will then be able to burn a DVD with the help of cop@@ ing . additionally , the target medium must be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data from source medi@@ ums in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . you can clear the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
opens the dialog to the format@@ ting of a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format which means the content can be completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you write your choice between the write modes and incre@@ mentally .
&quot; burns a previously created CD @-@ screen . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then immediately be used by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g @-@ files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning an previously created DVD @-@ image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can be eliminated by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; one previously exten@@ ed DVD video can be converted . this dialog box appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used all @-@ standing , and even ways to change the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the entry medium . this information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title @-@ length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of the tool@@ bar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small box at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is spread . &quot;
&quot; spl@@ its the folder view , or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , the content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives will also have a context menu with features such as media info , locking and un@@ locking the medium . &quot;
&quot; spl@@ its the ingredient , a view or off . the ingredients allows to choose and drag files into the project view . the content is also selected the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; spl@@ itting the head@@ bar in the view side view , or off . the header bar is a narro@@ wer area that contains only visible when the project view has no real function , it looks just pretty , and separates the project view clearly from the remaining opinions . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the ke@@ ystro@@ kes for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard order . &quot;
&quot; this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; furnishings . there@@ for , the correct permission to burning CDs and DVDs are required . therefore , system administration rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administration ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; open the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for example , general rules can be done . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; ought to work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alise and improve the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface with the help of this interface can be controlled using functionality of the functionality via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you can use either the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so rather your taste and type of your task is crucial to show which the programs you want . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you can use the command line @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p . to make use of &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; features that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program gem@@ a , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a creat@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project @-@ method , one can obtain an D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch Ver@@ t this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which only applies to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; &amp; H@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ a reading for &amp; k@@ de . with it , you can easily read audio CD ; s you can read and installed in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder of computers installed on the computer . &quot;
&amp; H@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in W@@ AV files on hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers who are installed by default ( this Ko@@ di@@ zer packages ) must still be installed from Linux distribution ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and saved in W@@ AV files on your computer ( verbal and com@@ pressed ) ; and then
become com@@ pressed in a second step of this W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) com@@ pressed into the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or other formats like the lu@@ st@@ proof FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package , if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step there must be l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ to ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers . all these programs are usually not necessary to compile something ourselves . however , only if FLA@@ C is not used to be used . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is also not required . &quot;
&quot; which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / File Format shall be used ? that chapter Which Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ aster , audio quality and com@@ pression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copying protection . in any case , it can not be possible to handle any copying protection . simply avoid the purchase of head @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while driving can only be done once , the furnishings may be called up until a suitable configuration is found ) , afterwards the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to comprehen@@ sion for the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface , about which you are often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ erer programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without network where everything is captured manually .
&quot; this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the site step by step , for example , there are more information on how this program is used and displays the screens@@ hot with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starting CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the installation of request at the tab CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case first the connection has to be made to the internet . ) &quot;
starts the reading and - if an En@@ coder is con@@ figured in the Products tab in the furnishings - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the selection can be read with an other en@@ coder as the standard . it is to be noted that before the En@@ coder is con@@ figured in the registration dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already selected file for the code is selected rather than a full &amp; CD ; per@@ ing and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the furnishings to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programs ( such as excerpts of the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ate ) . &quot;
opens the leading dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different maps ( such as en@@ coder to address the En@@ coder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , coding and com@@ pression rates and helps you choose the right body . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a lu@@ red audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low com@@ pression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats , losing information through data com@@ pressed depending on their psycho@@ active model , MP3 and O@@ GG requires a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both Ko@@ codi@@ ers produce a very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos; not as &apos; free , it will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge but there are open license issues . &quot;
+ high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at deeper bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music belongs to a computer or a machine @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices are available .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car @-@ stereo systems . today - in the beginning of 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and resulting com@@ pression advise for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most musical pieces of acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo and high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , com@@ pression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo and high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , com@@ pression rate approximately 5.5 . still needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo and high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR @-@ stereo , com@@ pression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . well enough for music of young people , portable equipment and car equipment . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that can be obtained manually or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the free@@ DB , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ program to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co @-@ operation , there is often a combination of programs for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and those parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ors explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the key@@ boards ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s must be coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters must be added from : ... &quot; tt { title } ... &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button drawing in assist@@ ants ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database in which people can download the audio CDs , so that all others can download the information instead of yourself : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ ders of the U@@ eber@@ ger , this is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music @-@ company can be added . all the information can be suppl@@ emented by a B@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively involved a crossing field ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( counter@@ feit ) address than that is not used in the system . this type of configuration may not be used ( This can only know the programmer who reviewed the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for the use of free@@ DB is set up , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally can be used in the nearest mir@@ rors . this saves band@@ width on the network and balances the load between machines . &quot;
&quot; a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mir@@ rors for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which le@@ aking program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; save in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that this cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more accurately , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see for sure that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed first , if this is not yet to happen . &quot;
&quot; for saving the W@@ AV files , the codi@@ fier and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first time you can pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a playful com@@ pression for audio data ) on the tab@@ s to address the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . other co @-@ di@@ ers can be added to this tab . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ erer package has to be installed from the respective Linux distribution install@@ ment , before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . further information about Ko@@ di@@ erer can be found in the chapter Which Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , more information on its switches can be obtained through the input of a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a consoles window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) must be replaced by the name of the installed code . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the establishment of the device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) installed . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read one copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have read the complete manual , all understood , but somehow still uns@@ afe what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for example , and you will get enough information to set up the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time to set everything up and to read our first &amp; CD ; we will use &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ note ( tags ) . &quot;
you need to be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . any suitable package for l@@ ame can be found as not completely free software . at least it is not necessary to compile the source files you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have scre@@ amed crying ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the fundamental setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something which is probably only done once , and &quot;
the second section describes how to go on a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each out@@ going &amp; CD ;
here we determine the comp@@ elling codi@@ fier to com@@ pression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet to download .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not find it with any one &amp; CD ; change once the proper settings are found . &quot;
the device drawing is delivered to the read@@ ability program to read it the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently , / dev / c@@ syndrome is a symbolic link to the real device drawing of your disk . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD @-@ Drive is available , it can also help the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the cart@@ el card General settings . here is not much to do . here an additional conversion is defined . in our example everything will be put in the screens@@ hot / entered as in the screens@@ hot .
&quot; only with full information please inqu@@ ire , so you will be notified when statements are missing from key@@ boards ( tags ) . &quot;
the cart@@ el card CD ; settings . just choose both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically download over the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the machine must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the Internet so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is simple , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame / fil@@ en@@ ame or fil@@ en@@ ame , and the ID@@ 3 tags you will be changed and the ID@@ 3 tags at K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , further to note : if you want to do everything manually , then dis@@ able the choices and free@@ DB is not used . however , this about 620 MB large , think this is worthwhile . to free@@ DB in the Open @-@ mode , you must be selected at least the first . the mode will be set up at the following map . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server about the Internet . how do the system , which data is to get the CD ? read the section about the free@@ DB page . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server in your area . on this path the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equivalent to what the server concerns , since many fire@@ walls may bo@@ ast the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , there is maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to transmit a &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should be dis@@ able .
simply take advantage of the settings of the screens@@ hot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of out@@ going pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es read and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to the &amp; CD ; start out at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you select this folder , then you can be stored the path / folder in which the W@@ AV files are stored . this folder is not printed when you want to make this folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; all you enter like it is on the screens@@ hot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be broken down to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio @-@ quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio @-@ stereo and for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the achieved com@@ pression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio @-@ quality and storage power consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of the generation tags on version V1 / V@@ 1 . &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags you can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Day for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in the screens@@ hot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; the number of CP@@ D files at the same time : with a Du@@ al@@ Core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be temp@@ ted , more than a W@@ AV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we just finished the basic establishment of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; end this configuration is used as default for each excerpt of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; in this section it is described as the process of the reading of the &amp; CD ; the folder structure is structured , the way how the music is structured in the hard drive , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB is being described in this section , must be repeated in this section , must be repeated in this section . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD ; we do not use the screens@@ hot for a little different from the data provided for a &amp; CD ; with successfully led by free@@ DB de@@ for@@ ested data . therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter , instead of getting it out of the Internet . you will refer to the differences . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example is to find this example . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet to happen , then the &amp; CD now needs to be defined in the main window , which is defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window as in the screens@@ hot . this only if the &amp; CD was identified ; as an audio CD ; it could be identified and can be read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this does not happen then search in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was successfully fet@@ ched by the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the album name and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key to your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database for the best to your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the cross@@ field for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialogue for settings ) , you can do this even manually or by choice of the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but take the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input the CD @-@ dates and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screens@@ hot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &quot; &quot; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist must no longer be entered into the input field &apos; Updated title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ z@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after successful withdrawal of the data from the free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editing device , so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words are satisfied with capital letters , or not ... ) , but also to consider whether there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and titles of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have a limited field length , at least on the &quot; &quot; File Settings &quot; &quot; tab , and take a look into the section &quot; &quot; settings &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can edit the files of the generated files later at any time with the Day editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ern or file formats . see the code in help to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obvious with the style of the in@@ quired CD ; i.e. this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway not forward . for more information go to the Website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example is to be found under rock .
&quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; you return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD Edi@@ tors will be back and you &apos;ll see that the fields for the album are already filled with the given data that we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . add the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way up to you all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB database . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed about the item list .
&quot; note that it has a check @-@ character in front of each line of a piece . just click the titles that are marked . a simple click on the line turns the selection of the piece , or add the button all pieces on the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selecting the reading process , this window appears to be confirmed . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out . &quot;
&quot; click on the rider orders for switching on the order window . he is in the left top half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently being read on hard drive . the status of the program will be shown at the bottom bottom of the window in the status column .
&quot; this error message see if you &apos;re trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer , which you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successful using a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we have entered in the example here . if you have checked sp@@ access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : contract 4 is the coding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . thus , reading and code parallel . notice the status message at the bottom of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configur@@ ations to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes to read and code . in the weak machines the result is unclear . the calcul@@ ator using a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and code ( but two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the final title is read out , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the body . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create com@@ pressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the codi@@ fier of your choice . &quot;
&quot; however , within the &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; however , you can talk to CV@@ S as part of the super@@ normal media package . however , you can download an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions available from your distribution . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to people , comp@@ iling from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help as the program can be adjusted to your needs , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program which calls for many different programs , has many varieties of settings . at best you can read the step by step for example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screens@@ hot of different boxes of settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still on reading ? even if only the help menu was printed , without any cl@@ ue as it will go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of program boot no audio CD ; in the drive is located ) , or from the un@@ usually brief menu of the program ? &quot;
&quot; what is it about ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should somehow look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it may well do . at least just after contacting the author . and if you &apos;re reading this , he has written this section and therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if it succeeded in taking the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N then you do not need this information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid : is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ s from &amp; k@@ de ; beside others he has not have some properties that other &amp; UNIX . -@@ MIDI players did not have .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it works on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ mid ; supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project drivers who is needed for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included , as soon as it is supported by a sequence . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid : shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it simple to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by means of the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can move into &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window on K@@ Mid
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the procedure used .
&quot; whenever you finish &amp; k@@ de ; end the play@@ back of a song , K@@ mid starts again with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; B ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window drop . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and bet@@ s the kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar , select the entry play out of the menu items or bet@@ s the Spac@@ eb@@ ar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid : a piece automatically starts as soon as you are moving to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then re @-@ played . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid : one piece , you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tem@@ po@@ on display . to re @-@ change the original speed , then double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the leather ac@@ aste has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button Select such as pressure on the button Select break or use of the menu entry into the menu item , then supp@@ ress the play@@ back . if you play the Spac@@ eb@@ ar during no piece , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play@@ back . &quot;
&quot; tex@@ ed@@ tex@@ te can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use textures , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be presented and even better : the event type is automatically selected , so you choose nothing manually . if you choose anything manually . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select from the menu settings to set text events and lyrics . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which can be summar@@ ised . these are played in line . in this section , you can use the collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , open first to the collection camp . this can be found in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then select the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the in@@ duc@@ tions in the collection camp . &quot;
the temporary collection take all songs that you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when using the application , this collection is not saved . concern that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , she needs to be selected in the collection camp . there you can add a song using the button . it appears in turn the file dialog , with whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song depends on the adjustment to the collection , according to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece in opening ( using file opening or drag and drop ) is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when Autom@@ atic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and logged . this collection will then be added to the continued pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection , select the collection and the desired song and then click away . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played out . if you select the menu , the songs are played out in order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or remove or remove random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ established . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection camp , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song further , select the kno@@ b next song , the entry next song from the menu items or push the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back to jump , select the button table piece , the entry set out of the menu items or push the arrow straight . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection , select the too delet@@ ing collection and click on the button Del@@ ete . &quot;
the temporary collection can not be deleted . however this does not matter as they can be saved by leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general MIDI MIDI output . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events translated into events that understands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always leaves a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ map because all Sound@@ cards GM -@@ compatible are ( including A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM radio devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you must edit the appropriate file from hand ( using your favorite author ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all the required re@@ aliz@@ ations for the playing of a piece .
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section that may seem as often as desired . prerequisite you have a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; name of the key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to display that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a paragraph is achieved . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not general MIDI MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard is pic@@ tured . the general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equation is ignored . it is believed that the GM @-@ patches in the right sequence is ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to place all tones , that this instrument need to place the tone with the number M . if your keyboard enter a gun ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , you can make a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun signal ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch , with which each tone represents another percus@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , basin , Marac@@ as &amp; etc . ) , and not the one , in which the sound also means the same drum ( as to possess some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to indicate how sounds are formed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section the order of rows is very important , as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
&quot; you can use multiple key@@ maps for each channel , and each instrument you need to use several key@@ maps . &quot;
Key@@ maps are used mainly to form tones on the per@@ sion@@ ing channel . check out as an example the provided key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to complete some channels to other channels , if you want to switch to the first and second channel , make it easy in CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings useful for key@@ boards that have the perc@@ ussion to a particular channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ Devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered between 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; N is the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will need to be defined in front of the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , the key@@ map will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , it will always be patch x used . &quot;
the option For@@ ce@@ patch can be useful for example to always use the l@@ ad patch on the per@@ sion@@ ing channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Rati@@ o is given to what relation to Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multip@@ lied with the value , this is calculated with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al com@@ missions are available ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting will be used because GM gives you a keyboard that should play a pitch on the 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards to be higher in a t@@ ave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you must try a little with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole range of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you can see which sounds are played just .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument , the kno@@ b is not more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view has ( until now ) two different views to view the played notes . the view select in the menu settings below the point edge view : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed with which one song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . for example , a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the speed , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just as two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file consists of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you will also get a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file you can also change the single instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , DE@@ B ) from &amp; k@@ mid . this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support you must download and install a source of distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree that this is supported &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
activate previously the cess@@ ation of automatic tun@@ es to the collection . otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can click the arrow key to the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to dec@@ eler@@ ate the play@@ back . to re@@ connect the standard temp@@ o to click on the LCD double @-@ click .
&quot; I have on one &amp; k@@ de ; work@@ space , a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; - window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way , I do not want to play a copy file , or if I want to play a file , just go to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or window , and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly without adding a collection without adding a collection , turn off the automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening of files &quot;
&quot; suppose you take the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ Midland . first , you only want to play the first file . so make the setup automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly that a MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then do you close , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank all the heart@@ felt thanks ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me that , further to &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid : was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) , I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect some time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to gather a little time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , music and propositions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want to make a question , a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a huge pleasure when you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact me by friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I might already have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid , completely written in my spare time and by nobody for this money . I would therefore emphas@@ ise that I can only make things more program@@ m@@ able because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;

a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer as the sound quality depends far from your sound card . it is not the same as if you use a FM radio device or a A@@ we card .
&quot; if you have no sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you could hear a sound@@ card , except that you can &apos;t listen to any music . &quot;

&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level . if you have an associated entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the play@@ back begins with the requested entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; updated pieces &apos; , TV and continuous playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do the different files in directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player , but also by using the menu item . using the cli@@ pping of a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , it needs to be chosen from the menu of the same with playlist , or select either the editing mode , or another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes are lost , if the mach@@ ining mode is left or another group will be selected without the playlist . &quot;
&quot; owing to the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player , some functions can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
the animation during star@@ ters and respon@@ sive can be disabled by Edi@@ ting of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ gu@@ c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can simply be inserted .
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; km@@ player ; the files are ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format needs to be an supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during the starter needs not to be short , it will be automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . however , this would be disturbing in the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
an easy example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite image : &amp; lt ; sm@@ iles ; &amp; lt ; / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / body@@ suit ; / body@@ suit ; / body@@ suit ; / / / / / / / / ; On the source package of &amp; km@@ player ; are supported in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; km@@ player ;
there is a rider for the configuration of M@@ player in the configuration dialog of &amp; km@@ player ; here the path can be adjusted from the M@@ player and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool to de@@ bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of km@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this play@@ back in the configuration dialog of &amp; km@@ player ; everything must be con@@ figured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ gu@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa .
&quot; flash &quot; can be played within &amp; km@@ player ; it can even be inserted in the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; thus , the &amp; km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can return , the &amp; km@@ player ; module as a service provider for the m@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the furnishings of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; km@@ player ; is available in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there isn &apos;t any errors , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; km@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manu@@ als the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , PH@@ ON@@ ON will play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be purchased , the scanner can be used to use the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data records ) settings in the settings below - &gt; source - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port to use . there , ports should be detected by which one is selected . the used coding must be found ( e.g. is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has an DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; as the V@@ DR can use of km@@ player only X@@ Video , should also function X@@ Video ( probably this type of play@@ back of video devices under Linux is the only working ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server needs to be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ el , dv@@ d@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , v@@ cd@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
&quot; is there any indication of how I can drive my CD@@ ROM drive , when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ? &quot;
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ syndrome is available as a user root on the setup of the device . it is absolutely sure to ask that / dev / c@@ syndrome work on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
X@@ ine laun@@ ches only slow because every time my CPU has to be tested on its performance ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time is x@@ ine the CPU . &quot;

lat@@ ex ; : a professional sc@@ oring application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be accessed through the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the Linux &amp; Linux ; -@@ distribution , for installation , the documentation of the distribution and installation CD ; / DVD can be used . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences of &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must probably hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation should be taken into account . if support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact about the k@@ ile should be made . &quot;
please contact us or at the comp@@ iling of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or become enh@@ ancements desired , this should be addressed on the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; work@@ space . &amp; k@@ ile ; the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical user interface and within these simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . additionally , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to know the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; users can start directly with reading the chapter of works with the editor of &amp; Kate ;

the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a valid function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of assist@@ ants ( men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some possibilities for creating the document . it can also be performed on the document related settings .

new users will now not worry about . it is a brief description of the functions and further information that can be found in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source text editors - the length of the used texts , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . through &amp; k@@ ile ; however , it is likely to be noticed that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it will trigger you through the modest appearance of output files . however , it will be saved by the cat@@ ching time and for@@ ce@@ ful history . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic de@@ priv@@ ation of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( to enter the text ) and the per@@ tin@@ ent line to the check@@ out of the command . this function can be disabled in menu settings ; setup ... La@@ TeX commands . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; trans@@ light the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most common and subtle part ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one mouse click on the respective . &quot;
in creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; as soon as a DVI ; -@@ file &#91; straight line ) in DVI ; -@@ viewer for the appropriate line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
&quot; a DVI ; -@@ file contains a description of the out@@ put@@ ted document and also other information such as the font , and is besides PDF file for@@ ks of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , transformation and to print DVI , files for different systems and services . &quot;
&quot; when using the R@@ Ã ¼ ck search are the elements of DVI ; -@@ file noted with the editor , the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text was cli@@ cked , becomes the appropriate place in DVI , -@@ viewer . &quot;
Master @-@ Document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a Master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide master @-@ document will be set to project settings .
quick : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error occurred in the source text ) .
file rep@@ airing : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file on the invali@@ d @-@ t@@ ing@@ nut W@@ ins and it takes no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the rapid construction .
&quot; in consideration of the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar the three gro@@ wers of the selection range are developed for the rapid integration of common elements into the document . the first choice field is for quick integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection range Other is to include articles such as tags , fu@@ tile notes or references . the options are available : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , an image or other element created . &quot;
cover : is used for reference to a fixed name ( select a selection field ) .
when using quote will be displayed a selection list with liter@@ ary insights . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors required . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be found in &amp; k@@ ile ; the author can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand
&quot; the last drop @-@ line with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font . it can be defined for the main text , the fu@@ tile notes , etc. are specified . there are the following Scrip@@ tures : &quot;
&quot; in the call of &amp; k@@ ile , two choices are available for creating a new document by selecting the document and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written down by hand . &quot;
&quot; brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; signi@@ fies the font . the font does not set at the beginning , this can also take place in the text . &quot;
once the above source text example has to be entered the &amp; lat@@ ex ; code text has to be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the menu or the kno@@ b @-@ fast construction .
the code is to be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for the storage is saved automatically .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document mistake , should be sought in the recording after errors . when using rapid design should be started and ey@@ epi@@ ece ; this is not the case , should also be considered the recording . &quot;
an environment ( English . environment ) is a text which is different from the remaining document . for example a report descri@@ bing the font . the command \ \ begin { environment } : \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end
the inj@@ ections are located only within the area ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end of environment } ) . there is no circum@@ fer@@ enc@@ ement within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities for stimul@@ ated the visibility of read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it can be added for example , certain fonts , li@@ ken@@ ing , tur@@ key , sub@@ missions , etc . , these commands may end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course of course and is long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be revealed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Rate : creates a quot@@ ation in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end .
&quot; after the background to write the source texts with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; official language is shown , now follows a step @-@ for @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once the wiz@@ ard was entered a bit of text , some adjustments to better legi@@ bility of the document should be accomplished . therefore , a quot@@ ation , a few places in li@@ pos@@ - and cur@@ ative and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , you can get back to the editor via editor &apos;s view or Str@@ g E ( the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI , file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script file . simply try and Spa@@ ak . &quot;
DVI ; is a key@@ word ( English ) D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi -@@ issue such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conversion or computer screen . &quot;
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the user can be printed by the print ( in the viewer ) ( provided the printer properly ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar the conversion of DVI ; -@@ file into other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been created , the transformation can begin in woven other formats by means of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the pre@@ dat@@ ory search yiel@@ ding the direct leap from the editor to the right position inside the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binary files . you only need to set up the Modern under settings K@@ ile ... tools build up .
&quot; to search for pre@@ dat@@ ors , the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor has to be positioned in a row of source tex@@ til and fall asleep on pre@@ dat@@ ory hunting . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; -@@ viewer is then done . &quot;
with this feature in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; pun@@ ched and to the appropriate line . for this must &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as a Tex@@ ts@@ di@@ tor ( settings Ok@@ ey@@ to set up ... Editor )
&quot; should the mistake by quick@@ set of the &amp; DVI ; the viewer is not possible , there may be a mistake . should a error occurred , this will be displayed in the log file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the recording file declares the error source of the source code . in the editor you can see the number of previous La@@ TeX error , and N@@ Ã ¼ ster La@@ TeX errors and nec@@ kl@@ ess @-@ bug errors for error messages , must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log file , and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the appropriate button is cli@@ cked in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose the template used for the document . the features are available : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document may be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard for the fast creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; case users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates can be saved in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either must create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; -@@ file , or create a new file , a new template can be created using an existing document and selection of file template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template into the new document , some character strings replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character coding ) . these variables can be set up in settings k@@ ile ... settings possible . &quot;
&quot; when creating a template , it is necessary to know which strings from which variables are to be replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ IS OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in documentation . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ IS OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
the easiest way to create a template is the use of assist@@ ants and the con@@ stric@@ ting of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way the following steps were taken :
&quot; when creating a new document , the proper pattern can be added instead of the rate of default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created an easy way to create a template , should be sought after one in the internet and carried out the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for many different kinds of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many adjustments for you can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its features , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile , can start directly with reading the chapter of works with the editor of &amp; Kate ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called the menu La@@ TeX reference reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands , which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use it as well as their syn@@ tax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ click with dr@@ ush string button , to fold the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way , clicking on \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par mature . &quot;
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with pushed lin@@ ker , the mature text will automatically be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow buttons , with dr@@ yers , you can taste parts of the source texts in the editing window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the different kinds of source texts ; for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can include additional ing@@ rays inside the text . it is highlighted in a separate type of book@@ marks , or the corresponding key@@ boards , so that they are automatically deleted at the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; the mach@@ ining is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; for though &amp; Kate ; already outstanding features , were added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source tex@@ til ; special commands may include the following commands to text selection : &quot;
&quot; if there are a complete paragraph ( group of lines contained on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph there is not a text with per@@ ched lines ( such as in other fashion dit@@ ors ) . these extended importance are close by means of tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of source texts . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the abbrevi@@ ation can be separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; find the word under the current c@@ urs@@ or@@ position . this selection has also an advanced meaning , as this command also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a rein@@ for@@ dable star ( \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for example , a part of the document may become natural , and can be removed by wir@@ es of the key . &amp; Kate ; offers the keys for a faster compatibility . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with own commands . under editing distances , the following commands may include : &quot;
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to manipul@@ ate packaging .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; play . therefore offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under editing environment for an easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command to be jump@@ ed to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the command to catch the surroundings .
with this command will be jump@@ ed to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to sh@@ out the surrounding area .
&quot; when the c@@ ursor or inside the command \ \ begin { surroundings } is , it becomes the end of the surroundings ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many bl@@ ur@@ ped environmental commands may quickly go over , this command closes the most recently ground@@ ed environment so that the wel@@ ded ambient structure is not atom@@ ized . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by br@@ aces { ... } are a few important commands that suit those from editing environment .
this command will be jump@@ ed to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the brack@@ et cl@@ amp .
with this command the end of the current group will be jump@@ ed ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the s@@ wollen cl@@ amp .
&quot; if the c@@ ursor in front or behind the t@@ weak@@ ened cl@@ amps , one &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , will be jump@@ ed to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many w@@ ax@@ ed groups @-@ brack@@ ets can be lost quickly the for@@ ce@@ ful groups . this command closes the most recently @-@ paved group , so that the con@@ vol@@ uted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups did not cause damage . &quot;

this automatic resour@@ ce@@ ful of the double occupancy can be used under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ TeX En@@ sur@@ es and deleted .
it can also be used with additional settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and that German or fran@@ k can be used as well . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; with Shift of Shift ; conc@@ e@@ aled &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent time limit . in case the current position inside a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) is available , for a time limit , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;

even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments . these can be added under settings k@@ ile ; establish ... La@@ TeX .
&quot; some users complain the columns in tables -@@ environments , and thereby assign all the E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) among each other . while we@@ aves the tab@@ ulator in the narrow line . although this tab@@ ulator is not related to the floating tab@@ ul@@ ators , for the columns of the current tab@@ ul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate ; already provided a good source code contrac@@ eption , it was installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; to have special commands . all these modes of work can be set up for different modes of work to set up ... understand@@ ings . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment by the command \ \ begin { near } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } following an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; at the carrier of the R@@ Ã ¼ ck , the final letter of the input will be removed and m@@ Ã ¶ IN@@ TE@@ T got the complete list of entry . on the other hand , the list may also be reduced by entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands may be written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are eliminated by &amp; k@@ ile ; alternatively , jumping marks can be attached , so that a single jump to these positions by mach@@ ining spr@@ ing@@ es N@@ Ã ¤ den ski stamp will be attached and the found parameters can then be attached . &quot;
&quot; among settings k@@ ile , set up ... k@@ ile ; complete preferences can be done to these lists . it can be washed various W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ r &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as wound @-@ arms of the general language use . &quot;
the command mode is not restricted by working environments . there is always a few letters associated with \ \ begin and the call of understanding . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of the environments . &quot;
&quot; in the call of the contrac@@ tion mode for the menu , the menu is automatically folded in the environment and it appears \ \ begin . afterwards , the environment can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and may be termin@@ ated by wir@@ ing the entry . &quot;
&quot; once this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognis@@ es that it is a list environment , it is even a first \ \ item -@@ command with folded . &quot;
&quot; among settings k@@ ile , setup ... k@@ ile ; complete preferences can be made to these lists . this mode uses the desired list of default mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; supported user @-@ defined lists of def@@ aul@@ ts , which are instantly replaced by lum@@ ax@@ .@@ c@@ wl , in the file exam@@ ple@@ .@@ c@@ wl , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the Word = performed , the men@@ Ã ¼ n@@ elling de@@ pletion or the key@@ ing brack@@ et + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , is replaced by the character L by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; gro@@ w@@ s@@ Ã ¼ n@@ Ã ¼ cher is not helpful , however , that many wound in a document has been written more than once . hence , it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the dec@@ eler@@ ation for all already written wound . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the men@@ Ã ¼ ch c@@ ile settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ an@@ ach will be de@@ ported . here , the Corpor@@ a value can also be defined as an indication of contrac@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the contrac@@ tion files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Persian Home folder , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ er@@ back ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ er@@ back ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialogue graphics incorporate the resour@@ ce@@ ful of graphics as simple as possible . in order to ensure the foundation for the graphics formats , sections and sections should be considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for ex@@ fil@@ tration and re@@ arrangement of sites . the PDF file can be arranged , so you can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script , and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to go to the result of work can be compiled , the source code should be compiled . all components tools are group@@ ed into the men@@ Ã ¼ s creation of comp@@ iling , creation and creation view . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source texts for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion may be used the touch @-@ code into the default device using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file into a PS file and can be viewed via Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the command @-@ pressure air is normally called a viewer after the comp@@ iling . should not be used in an observer viewer , every time a new window will pop up . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project for new project .... this is the following information for the project :
&quot; for use of the file name , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the custom@@ ary to be managed by EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ Ko@@ de . the script can be administr@@ ated in the lo@@ wing @-@ right head .
the API @-@ scripts have not yet been developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods : &quot;
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite clear system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different aid to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are provided with many documents . there is a documentation for the contained packages and a more &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; a full refer@@ ral refer@@ n@@ z for &amp; tex ; and it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is a complete solution for a certain format@@ ting . since this is a very close document , it is divided in &amp; k@@ ile ; divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / lyrics , the Fin@@ der gives the right document is not always easy . as usual help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; the small application ar@@ do@@ doc@@ t@@ k provides a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; out of documents and available for a graphical surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package name or stroke . by &amp; k@@ ile ; only the results are displayed .
&quot; a double @-@ click with the mouse or the bed , the viewer , the viewer , for the document . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ ded and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source texts , which can be folded on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ ile ; it is also part of the Fink project , thus reducing &amp; k@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS X . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphi@@ cally editor to manage many different sig@@ natures for e @-@ mails . the sig@@ natures can edit you in the graphic interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command line @-@ interface , you generate random sig@@ natures or t@@ sig@@ natures from a list . this command line interface provides the sig@@ natures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; for random sig@@ natures , any signature from the signal file from &amp; k@@ sig ; read through many sig@@ natures with different cit@@ ations , styles and information you can design your e @-@ mails diversi@@ fied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day @-@ free nature , the same signature is read from the signal file from &amp; k@@ sig ; for each day you use different sig@@ natures as with the random sig@@ natures , create unique email . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; empty sign@@ boards ; and add them with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file saved or click on the disk symbol . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sig@@ natures as you can . then you have a list of sig@@ natures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use e @-@ mails private or professional , there are always sufficient sig@@ natures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the menu File Del@@ ete or click on the icon with the red cross distances in the tool@@ bar . &quot;

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use com@@ bo as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination gives fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation , said pro@@ c , and how above it is . lift it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal screen ; simply the symbol for the XML processor are printed and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is attached to the folder if you do not , then remove the selected working folder and enter the folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files ; files are deleted each time if mein@@ pro@@ c started .
&quot; as already said , everybody who has already worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked just how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the only opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then they simply let the current work folder . if not , then select up @-@ to @-@ date work@@ folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an issue on the screen , her file is imm@@ utable . please check them the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file has already been highlighted in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then they just leave the current file easily . if not , delete it in current file format and select the file required by other file - file sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; if they just want to know if the file well @-@ formed , it is the Well @-@ formed review selection . &quot;
&quot; for the use of a &amp; D@@ T@@ D , which is specified in the &amp; XML ; ( Intern@@ al ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) and enter the place of &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; by Defini@@ tions @-@ UR@@ I ; as well as for the Relax@@ ation testing , is the indication of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection . &quot;
&quot; Ja@@ ques , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; machine vision ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the processing file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already be highlighted , then make up the current file just cho@@ oses . if not , remove them to select current file and select the file selection using the other file file sel@@ ector . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is to be named , and the file is usually stored in their sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you have little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can get rid of the additional functionality immediately and don &apos;t need to wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . more about them find them below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we start with the menu @-@ plug in manipul@@ ate . thus the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; this dialog allows you to manage and add new plugins , and we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it : &quot;
here you can enter the search button . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location of plug &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the addiction of the plug @-@ ins .
many people often work on a project several individuals in a type hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the provision of team members and this can be con@@ figured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project as well as sub@@ project leader .
the user can look out even from the list of team members who he is . this happens when brow@@ sing the team member from the list and put the button as presses . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears f@@ ett after you are : text .
the nickname and setting of your own identity are important for news and comments . see further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be created an event to the information manager , when something specific happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that will be executed when something specific in the project is happening . an example would be drawing up the opening and closing of the project , so that later someone can be seen , or the sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that will add a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; on the site event configuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , it can be edited and deleted events . &quot;
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see list of selected addres@@ see . the addres@@ see may be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see where such lad@@ der will be set up .
note are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments using the following things :
note is simple . it can be chosen either the note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ menu menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a commentary box followed by incentive text .
&quot; notes can be sent a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( roll ) is part of a role in the project consisting of the following possibilities : team manager Sub@@ project lad@@ ders should be led to the corresponding tyres - or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
nick@@ names and roller names are independent of large - or small @-@ ten@@ ded , but space to cl@@ as@@ ps and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and format@@ ting languages that is supported by D@@ T@@ D testing and web@@ based form@@ ati@@ zation and scripts .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be called via settings Qu@@ anta ... called out @-@ dialog on some pages that may be dealt with each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with respect for tags including car completion may be changed . the entries are :
&quot; big / inf@@ usion of tags : large / low @-@ write tags . normal day / small @-@ write means , the tags are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; great / inf@@ usion of attributes : large / low @-@ ten@@ ded of automatically con@@ stru@@ ed attributes . normal wholesale / low @-@ write means , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the day@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if raised , is optional for tags , for which the end day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags except the simple tags .
&quot; start @-@ up and finish day automatically update : if switched on , the subsequent tag will be changed and vice @-@ versa . &quot;
automatic income of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of ak@@ acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during the inser@@ tion .
m@@ ime types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the Standard Rec@@ ord@@ ings may be restored the default ones can be recovered .
standard strings : the coding of newly created or in another way than using the file opening files ( where the coding of the file can be passed over ) . however , this setting will be issued by the same in the project Properties in case a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D will be used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D was not recognized . but this attitude here is made by the same in the project Properties in case a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; made regular backup copies , so that in the next start of the program the document will be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as stor@@ ing the file . also for not stored documents a backup is regularly created , according to the specified time . &quot;
&quot; preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or one &apos;s view ( respectively the documentation in a box ) , which makes it possible to see the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
Set the window settings on the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface has come through to change the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command parameters .
&quot; the warning messages -@@ area serves the tax of the possibility , the display of war@@ nings carried out by no longer inqu@@ ire . &quot;
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL : to change . it can be defined the display of symbols instead of scrip@@ tures as well as synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in the shared mode . with regard to the different modes of modes .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the struc@@ ture@@ tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document to be adjusted in details . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse click on the struc@@ ture@@ tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking on the structure of structure with the mouse @-@ b@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in the area of struc@@ ture@@ tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree under editing and how deep in a change of struc@@ ture@@ tree will be automatically set . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are not found where the current document has been found no element . &quot;
&quot; the area for solid cut of abbrevi@@ ations ( some kind of templates ) that are un@@ divided into groups , each one can be divided into groups , each one can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ ake short@@ cut signi@@ fies something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins you can manage plug @-@ ins . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ App@@ lications from the third site , which can be re@@ used by each K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , at the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in inser@@ ting an plug @-@ in need to be the following : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plug @-@ in at the start , it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ esis &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in has refused to shop . only @-@ L@@ esis @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to store the shop , if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : if this is activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the plug @-@ in information is correct , then the plug @-@ in at the moment is not available , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the error search was completely new developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been adjusted so as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows different implem@@ entations of plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plugin selection field can be changed the specific settings .
&quot; if for a project a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
a view in which the contents of super@@ vised variables is displayed . usually appear in the left @-@ hand dock .
&quot; a view , in which all the brack@@ ets , with number numbers and conditions are listed . usually appear in the lower Dock . &quot;
&quot; a view , in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appear in the lower Dock . &quot;
depending on the supported functions of the Deb@@ u@@ ggers everything or part of the following functionality is available .

&quot; this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to your needs , and how you can improve &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help you to become better . &quot;
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scripts . they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; skills such as car @-@ understanding and ch@@ estnut trees ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; B &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS . day @-@ folder contain two file types , the &amp; pro@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and day@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ on window ) , which insert text and instructions faster in a document than a user . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see details for the conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; pro@@ sthe@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bar . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property di@@ alog@@ es ; it contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for the tag allows a fast inser@@ tion of tags in a document without risk of writing errors .
&quot; day folder are nothing but a folder . you only contain the &amp; pro@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the day @-@ XML files . day @-@ folder bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the file XML and declare whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users will have a better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and borders is presented in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a conference document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it does not contain merely an element type above itself . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it is called &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type meth@@ od valid . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attri@@ but@@ able and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; Day . that &apos;s a single element Type element .
&quot; describe an attribute of a tags . this item can only happen once for each attribute . it contains the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags you describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element @-@ type element . &quot;
prints the source used for the attributes used in the day @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and on the attribute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for achieving the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments that can be passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ on % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can occur only once . it is a sub@@ element type element .
sets the position of the attribute a tags inside a dialog box . this day can occur for each attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the item is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
&quot; prints a list of elements that may occur within the chosen tags . this element is an only element type . &quot;
&quot; prints a list of elements that end up a day . this element is an only element type . &quot;
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ als ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and have to be gre@@ ased and closed .
&quot; space affects nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be done by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; be replaced . this will not cause any mis@@ cre@@ tion , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the conference XML files , the tools can start on top of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ C . another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; currently , this function is not yet available . currently , check only in loading of the conference XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; in the following an example of a family 1 / XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; diagram . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this conference file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP file will be described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of these Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; function &quot;
&quot; the &amp; gr@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as fairly simple and there is an editor available through D@@ T@@ D collabor@@ ated D@@ T@@ D settings ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; General &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nickname = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname . &quot;
&quot; an action can set up with settings ... click on New promotion , for the same dialogue : &quot;
this action @-@ proven key@@ ring . with clicking the user user interface can be assigned a key@@ chain ; with K@@ one the current key@@ chain can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the Det@@ er@@ ased settings and when carrying out the action this text is inserted in the document on the current C@@ ursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts ) , but there@@ for it is not limited to use the document or use as input ( or parts of document ) , themselves are the quick start @-@ dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified b@@ ade are allowed , it is recommended to find the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variation in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is only one instance running , the text unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods can be a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to enter the standard input . in the drop @-@ line input can be determined , which can be sent to the default file . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input can also be re@@ directed to the output of the exec@@ uting application . there are two types of output : normal issue , written on the standard version . it can be specified , which shall be submitted to the default text written by the value of the selection panel : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create a custom tool@@ bar . in given case it is not too many , so one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add promotions and configure . select settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
filling out all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the day attributes have attributes and you plan their use , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; if available , so that entering the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ or ! is it a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ download ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol is not only helping you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a laun@@ cher as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually be interpreted as los , star@@ red , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled ; if the day in the current document is fit . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol , it must be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ olate ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text box , there is a button that press him . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; push the use button and continue with other tags , so there are still what gives , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for the tool@@ bar , or it should be set to a better overview of several tr@@ ator in several groups . make sure the tool@@ bar set to be selected via settings tool@@ bar . make sure that the tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; I want to select the separ@@ ator ( very left top ) for my tool@@ bar . according to the selection of the element that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the denom@@ in@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my work@@ top , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or might believe the opposite of the start button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar needs to be tested by means of all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; backup in the right folder . after real@@ is@@ XML does not exist , it will be im@@ bal folder ( n ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their work@@ bar ( s ) loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I first use a &amp; PHP ; documentary tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory , whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to locate an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part is left to you , the second we treat here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc thee = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # items in the main index Top element = &gt; Sec@@ ure@@ th@@ .html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3@@ .html ? &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Cont@@ ext@@ 1 Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3@@ .html . 2 = func@@ 2@@ .html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2@@ .html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 3@@ .html
&quot; the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something : &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc thee = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements Top element = index.html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = In@@ tro@@ duction = R@@ tro@@ duction = R@@ tro@@ duction = ... Basic syn@@ tax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax ....
notice the # from Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the shaft fur@@ pers ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
&quot; note that the content of the index is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ential in the upper end of the tree @-@ view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) . &quot;
&quot; space affects nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; and @-@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resources c@@ end@@ at@@ ters are replaced . &quot;
the content section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is intended for the design of the contex@@ tual support . for example if writing a &amp; PHP ; script running the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connections .
&quot; a simple list of two separate context elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply save as $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( like you indicated this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure that these good and it &apos;s worth to be divided , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web developers . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the lat@@ ure resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bar with promotions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by em@@ ail@@ mail to friends , partners or else who are sent . at different places there is a single @-@ mail menu item , like D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , as the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users are checked and only available if our team needs them as accurate and useless for publication . to ensure the use of resources , the resources of the resources are assured , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; in the up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private g@@ PG keys ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys you may choose a . in the dialogue New resource you have to stay empty ) and with clicking on OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can be loaded from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) system ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , even before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by exam@@ ining the integrity and signature . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity are given and the resource is correct , a message with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource appears . &quot;
it &apos;s possible to work on XML languages that is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files in the convention format may be necessary . there is the simpl@@ est way to convert an D@@ T@@ D to a D@@ TE@@ P package .
&quot; conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D store and conver@@ ting of a D@@ T@@ D menu . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description , which is to be used . afterwards , the following dialogue will appear : &quot;
target @-@ page@@ name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Scre@@ w foot@@ er : the string included in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Day , like HTML Public - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; the refinement of the D@@ TE@@ P according to the conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after the conversion to the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . to understand and get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so , one must first express these concepts with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; little benefits . &quot;
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is available . by tool@@ bar above actions it is available , in the joint folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it enables the group of administr@@ ators to secure actions and patterns in the global tree , which then can be available in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements present a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bar . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a certain project . this can be everything from CSS . -@@ patterns , up to tool@@ bar with special promotions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder @-@ tree of the project , allowing the joint use of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editing window , the building views , the boxes with information and the tool@@ bar . please suggest you , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the boxes with the right mouse button to receive a counter @-@ menu with the current document fixed entries , re @-@ load , delete or load the document , jump , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editing area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / copy / paste ) , editing the under the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor , or opening the file when the string is referred to a file under the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editing window , the tool@@ bar of the Edi@@ tors . currently takes on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bar is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bar are adapted to the new features and related user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if you want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; you want to insert the symbol that the day is represented . now , you can insert the data for this exactly one day . if you want to insert the data on this one day . if you want to insert the data ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog various fields . &quot;
&quot; the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and per@@ ro@@ am . in the presentation with cart@@ els for files , project , sample templates , scripts , attributes and documentation designs . &quot;
project management is a powerful tool which provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all files in the project and allows the pamper@@ ing of the files in the project by using right mouse click . actions such as add , removing , upload or delet@@ ing the files from the medium medium can then be displayed with the text menu . &quot;
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of Tem@@ plates . almost everything can be a template . pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; working area . global templates are always available to find local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are available only in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scripts . the concept of integration in Global , Local and project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information about a script . via the right mouse button are further functions available , such as the script to start , edit or send with E@@ Mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ Click of an element , the c@@ ursor in the document is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ Click of a module , a list of commands related to navigation and refres@@ her the building . &quot;
&quot; this tree will appear under the other building views . with it , some can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . this enables the contents of all available attributes , which allows the modification of all available attributes with few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for Web @-@ technology to find your development . there can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; documentary site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two kart@@ ing at the bottom of the window to be reached via the usable information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this cart@@ on show information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . for example , the D@@ T@@ D test is used for example , and all changes used to D@@ T@@ D . &quot;
&quot; this divi@@ ding show all the errors in the check@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts , which are executed , give all the error messages ( such that gives ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . demonstrate in a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the opportunity to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool@@ bar as com@@ pressed T@@ ar archive through &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they get a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as any other secure and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system , auto@@ conf file a number of options that can be delivered to the configure script . to understand a complete list of options , you give . / configure / help . the options are simple to understand and not run here . &quot;
if you have problems with the starting point of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a Web development tools for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optim@@ ised for a quick Web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor to create the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , expand@@ able Mark@@ up languages ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tools for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . that &apos;s how to define it in &amp; XML ; that &apos;s the suitable &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above demand has to be listed , that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; Develop@@ ers is based on good use of free software , the idea of Why developers , what has been developed to others ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ inity is not just that everything is possible , but allowing users and developers to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allow Web developers to increase its use of intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can expand productivity almost every task . by the program Com@@ rade , they can add &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ( more about them can be found in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta , plus ; is a Web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web design and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; associated with the original developers sent the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .

&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . take a look at the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ deposit box , only a mistake will be reported . &quot;
converted with inser@@ ting out of the cli@@ p@@ board there in a special character to &amp; HTML ; moving so that it is displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as a form@@ ative instruction .

&quot; spl@@ its the block@@ sel@@ ector , or off . this allows you to choose text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; taste . &quot;
go directly to a number number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
searches for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .

exclusion and switch @-@ off of the problem @-@ por@@ ters at the bottom of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem @-@ por@@ ter will be activated once you change to the structure .
&quot; displays the tool@@ bar left from the main window . this column allows you to sit read , read , with a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries of predic@@ ting or neighbour@@ hoods , depending on the position of the C@@ urs@@ ors in the document . &quot;
bookmark from other printed documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ames of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the file turn .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searched the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows e.g. graphics files in your project folder or to copy a sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depend on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further inputs / output layer ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
&quot; loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu , if you assigned it to this project . &quot;
&quot; a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of the tool@@ bar : locally or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved via tool@@ bar tool@@ bar or you are wondering if you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; remo@@ ves a tool@@ bar out of the wid@@ est range . it does not delete it from the hard disk . if you have not yet stored the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you would like to do that . &quot;
&quot; this way , you can send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team , so the tool@@ bar in the next release is present ) . the menu item opens up a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; enables the up@@ loading of the tool@@ bar on the main server , where any other can access it . &quot;
invite one &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; that you or anyone else made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; load the En@@ ti@@ ties of the En@@ ti@@ ties from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it is useful if the En@@ ti@@ ties are from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global , and a sp@@ elling at the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags , which are loaded in the currently loaded factory vehicles . if the standard is loaded in the tags menu , a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
allows access to the current day of dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are denied , if this day refers to this place the rules . &quot;
in the plug @-@ ins menu the available plugins are listed under the items listed above . click on them . click on a activated plug @-@ ins de@@ activated .
select the syn@@ tax mode for the current file . the list of available Her@@ vor@@ tices is hanging from der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of time identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people , the other OS platforms to use . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checking the syn@@ tax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; using the external application of tidy .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of the user interface . through some restrictions in the K@@ DE @-@ libraries can sometimes need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the kart@@ ing mode , which is also the default mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu includes an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selecting a single command the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
&quot; the display of the status bar on the lower edge of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window , or off . &quot;
&quot; the changes in this dialogue will be influenced each application , which use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
Set the behavior of the editing p@@ ane . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or which can add and the town@@ houses can change . &quot;
&quot; this should produce a help in accordance with the installation of the mouse c@@ ursor , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled best from above , as after the filling of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example foo . when entering name is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can download the server address of the machine to which one wants to access , except you are dealt with local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exam@@ ple@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if one can empty this field empty , the default settings of the selected log is used . depending on the settings of the remote host , an adaptation could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates will be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be set instead of standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , in which the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool bars . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be set instead of standards . &quot;
&quot; that allows files to include files from the local fil@@ es@@ ystem , into the project . it can be selected several files or entire folder . &quot;
&quot; this setting is great if you have static content you can download and modify ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; to leave if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started again , not an@@ ho@@ oks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a detailed selection of a d@@ inning . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking , or by removing the Bun@@ ny , cl@@ ing out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be arranged in the menu with project characteristics in the sub @-@ window format or with the short@@ cut shift ; F@@ 7 changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional items are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ card possible ) that can be re@@ used in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; suppl@@ em@@ ental option to above , also files which are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded with the opening of the project . it can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; thus , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently , Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set with the button options . in the error search is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles can be adjusted high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a building @-@ view for the content of the server for each profile , adding an own element of view for every profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window configuration , project members can be added , processed or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event you can switch event actions and add these actions to change or delete . event actions are executed , when a previously specific event occurs , such as ech@@ oring a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot currently be influenced . &quot;
to open a different project please select Project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j to expand .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you are asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project management gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder behave as well , but you are missing entries in opening and opening ... in with the right mouse @-@ mouse menu : &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the place of high @-@ per@@ missible files . &quot;
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only if more a profile exists , the button is termin@@ ated to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password is kept in the main memory and remember the program is useful if most frequent up@@ loading files is needed and the rather un@@ secure password to save the record is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ loading profiles can be created , and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded onto various servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
&quot; that is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address . &quot;
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; to file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator runs a service not at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the record , so that it can &apos;t be easily read , but everybody with programming conditions can be easily seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be loaded in a project many points , i.e. , through simple exchange views , other files and work@@ stations can be loaded and replace the current files and work@@ stations . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ologists ; to their own working method . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bar are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best way to distinguish between the menu tool@@ bar . use and execution differ below in the section adding plant vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and symbols on it can be adjusted either through counter @-@ menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with new action , a new tool@@ bar can be performed , or the tool@@ bar can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where indicated , which actions can be visible on these or other tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition the entries will remove action and recorded action which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bar ... and settings actions .. dis@@ continued .
&quot; templates are essentially document@@ aries , code cut@@ lets and files to build up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used in principle as a common file system with enhanced organisation and interfaces . you can copy , move or block each at the system available directory in the pre @-@ deposit box . assi@@ sts in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you can imagine for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each template used in front of the use .
&quot; binary is all that is not pure text . there can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . bin@@ aries are normally included in documents using a link ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created from any text documents . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , special smells for the purpose and organise the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the pre @-@ block tree under global templates . &quot;
this kind of Tem@@ plates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be inserted in the document . you can find everything from a comment about a final note on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see for more information on templates tree .
&quot; as the name says , these templates will be organized for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure . currently there are no examples of articles in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; design a document structure according to Beli@@ ever ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as template save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project base ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the pre @-@ block tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document , and click on file as templates to save choice as local / project base . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with drag@@ ging and distr@@ action on the assem@@ blies . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a pre @-@ deposit folder . you can use all the file management functions , such as drag@@ ging and distr@@ acts or add the file tree of kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click in the file tree or in the project files building files on a folder on the right and secure a site template , but by default it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
project templates make a very target @-@ oriented advance . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create files or connect with them . in addition you can keep some things in understanding in projects very profound .
&quot; the pre @-@ deposit structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / in@@ ges@@ ted files . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of container , as explained above . &quot;
&quot; to specify the behaviour of a folder , right click on the folder and select in the context menu features . the following Dialog appears : &quot;
a drop @-@ line with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is de@@ duc@@ ted as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes has been hal@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this is standard enabled and fits for everything except the regular folders in the pre @-@ deposit box . if a regular folder would basically be dis@@ able , except they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ak@@ ah would appear with something like lyrics . if nothing appears , one is probably in a regular folder . &quot;
disclaimer or text for templates in this folder . these may be general he@@ aders and foot@@ er for all templates for a particular project and allows copying from content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ er .
&quot; in addition , you are equipped with context menu ( show right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor which can be reached via the menu View . the first mode replaces the code text in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL . -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a c@@ ursor . then you can edit and re @-@ edit the source code in the source code as required .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL , editor on a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol to edit it from &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly to the source editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron is enabled , this mode is already active , the key@@ boar@@ ded to the active C@@ ursor from one window to the other , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
the synchron@@ isation gap between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor is sett@@ able via settings Qu@@ anta . you can choose between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in principle the recommendation of a small Sp@@ anne can be adjusted for fast machines and a great sp@@ anne for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the processing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the suspension lat@@ ch . &quot;
met@@ a tags provide the storage of information about the document itself as key words for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressures of the two buttons below . a click into the list allows to change the content , e.g. key words on the column name and key key@@ word on the content -@@ column . &quot;
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to design the design of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS @-@ rules with the buttons in the list . the editing of CSS @-@ rules are not currently supported .
&quot; it is possible to bind an external CSS @-@ style system by pressing the file button , and the corresponding file is chosen . &quot;
&quot; the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , possible thanks to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the c@@ ursor beh@@ aves as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted through typ@@ ing or by re@@ tool@@ ing or removal . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor , it &apos;s important to note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags , e.g. if an anchor tag , has to be inserted with text , any other surrounding anchor tag will need to be removed . &quot;
&quot; some work compar@@ es like the sheets assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists are used . &quot;
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining Stil@@ templates . in contrast to other programs for Stil@@ vor@@ lagen - the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the period can be pursued .
&quot; around &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully compile it , do except &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ ar and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;

&quot; in this command a partial or complete agreement is checked with a pre @-@ name of QNAP ME or a given case name . &amp; eg ; template agre@@ es with each QNAP ME , which includes the string template . &quot;
&quot; any nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; &quot; QNA@@ ME &quot; &quot; is ampli@@ fied by the rules defined by the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
&quot; a requested carrier must be solved for the per@@ missible UR@@ I and Zei@@ len@@ eck . this is automatically re@@ constructed when loading the first template through x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . post@@ ures will be re @-@ checked , shortly after the start of each flow . &quot;

on systems with installed read@@ line library you can have with the arrow buttons on / off through the memory memory of the previously mentioned commands .
&quot; multiple commands may require more than an argument . quotes may be used to pass together as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument will be a carrier in a file named &quot; &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that consists only from the ASC@@ II character 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a completely qualified name as &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the system of user . on Uni@@ or or Cy@@ g@@ win systems the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder .
path : a path to the remo@@ ves of the work folder . on some operating systems the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced with the path to your personal folder .

&quot; there are many graphical tools to compar@@ isons . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly , why I wrote . &quot;
the interaction was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had changed many changes while at the same time I changed a lot of positions at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts throughout .
I used the program used by me only changed the modified lines but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where maybe only the inc@@ eption was changed . that &apos;s that changes was a little night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , many more useful features were added . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare text for example , just copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the compar@@ ative window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work , was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ fl@@ edged file browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ way merge will be fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps reduce the release of conflicts . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screens@@ hot shows three cross files to merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with compar@@ isons , and merge complete folder . this screens@@ hot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the folder : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and serve them about the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check the code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and to@@ ul@@ ators are visible visible . if lines are visible only in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble changes when J@@ em@@ and the unic@@ ation changes . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color indicate that both are different files . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can simply complete the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ work by simply write the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o Target
&quot; the Open @-@ dialog allows the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ame , selecting the file @-@ browser ( file ... ) or select an recently opened file from the list . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you have to empty the entry for C , the analysis of the differences performed with two files . &quot;
&quot; via the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ ing or mer@@ ging of folders is introduced . if for a file is selected , for B and C , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when merge together , the input field is active for the goal and cannot be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to establish a output player immediately . you can also do this step later on stor@@ ing . &quot;
the setup button opens up a dialog with settings . here you can define options before you start with the compar@@ isons / .
&quot; sometimes one does not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . it will allow you to choose text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active compar@@ ative window . the comparison starts immediately . in open dialogue you do not need to select files , you can simply complete the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use drag and tr@@ ays : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let him fall on a similar window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how much these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would have to simply copy two relevant files , they are in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and compare them to the relevant sections . now you can simply copy the relevant sections easily , then insert it , and then compare them . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , you can do nothing out &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the fall of text in a compar@@ ative window is supported . &quot;
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the drag@@ ging and distr@@ action of text into another program than cut and add ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info @-@ line of the source window includes the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the number number of the first visible line in the window . ( see that Windows C is optional . ) E@@ de Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is optional . ) E@@ de Info @-@ line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is displayed . then a little aid window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three sources are assigned the letters A , B and C are assigned the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be modified via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one sees to the colour which file differs . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) good . &quot;
&quot; on the left , next to the text is the Com@@ prehen@@ sive column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + , e.g. , white characters are relevant only in strings and comments , for the processor and in a few , rare occasions . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the syn@@ cing column of the text , is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines . when the time limit has been activated , the line is pointed to the surrounding lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison window ) has also a info line with the title issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changed &#93; when you have processed the result . usually it contains by the automatic merge existing text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! to all conflicts are dis@@ solved , the stor@@ ing is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to ni@@ ve@@ able / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons will be used , any difference is at the same time a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group will be displayed in all windows , and the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows . this group becomes the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for current areas and then appears on the left a black beam . &quot;
&quot; sometimes by automatic comp@@ action , or by manu@@ als no further line will be left in the group ; then one line in the source is left ; then one line in the source file is displayed ; this text is not shown in the final file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might want to copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; assem@@ bling , however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources the options contain numbers or ign@@ oring C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the images and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you use in one of the windows , right , down , side , end , Str@@ g @-@ Start and Str@@ g @-@ end use , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the Aug@@ ab@@ ef@@ en@@ ster you can also use the other buttons to manipul@@ ate . using the inser@@ ting button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ loading mode . ( pre @-@ set is the setup mode . ) &quot;
&quot; one click with the left mouse button , in one of the summar@@ ised columns , synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section ) and the edi@@ table output window was explained . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / final difference ( C@@ tr@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ top ) , to the next / pre @-@ previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Strasbourg / Str@@ g @-@ Picture ) , or at the next / previous conflict . therefore , it has to be differences between dis@@ solved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ er to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to automatically copy the Cop@@ y button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ unic@@ orn ) . if this option is automatically copy , whatever you select , automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board copies and manual copying drops . be careful with this option but you could write such the content of the cli@@ p@@ board acci@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; time @-@ len@@ ders will be stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a tempor@@ al code notes \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car sl@@ ag \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 reserves the time lines of source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use with bin@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; the options and list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved , and restored at the next start . ( menu setting ) - &gt; Buy 3 up ... ) &quot;
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog presents fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in recur@@ ve Scripture will not be depic@@ ted . if the chosen writing this representation does not support , nothing happ@@ end . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form but would be categ@@ orized . on these systems the kno@@ b pres@@ ets automatically displays an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , when pressing the tab@@ ulator button , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press the return or return , the recovery of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual de@@ copy into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; you can select , which time type you prefer to save . the present value is the commonly used selection on the operating system . &quot;
&quot; in compar@@ isons of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all identical rows can be found in the source files . only during this first step can be ignored white signs . the second step is compar@@ es any line . in this step white signs will not be ignored . also , white signs will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a pin connector &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a time frame &apos; \ &apos; . usually , if this option is enabled , the car down@@ marks are made visible , however , such as a white character are activated , however , this option may be de@@ activated . in preference this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , figures and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result the differences will be displayed , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
in the default setting this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
&quot; intensi@@ vely searching for even smaller sub@@ differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective for complicated and big files , but slowly at very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ atic @-@ end mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; it is useful for all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source . ( pre @-@ set is manual choice . ) That &apos;s useful when white characters are less important in many files , then you can better use the functions of voters A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ign@@ oring C / C + + -@@ Comments . &quot;
&quot; these options are treated in the chapter for scanning , folders and passing by a compilation . look for details on documentation for directory comparison and inter@@ performance . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a back@@ log file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , this will be er@@ ased without further backup . &quot;
&quot; adapting the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current current program . you must finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and re@@ boot this change is active in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it is not available , because the language is global via the control center . ) &quot;
the following code settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . once you activate this option is used for all entries the upper setting .
&quot; the selection of the lists for coding appears to be a short notice , what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has an informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file coding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting them . since the coding for each file is separately adjustable , even files can be compared with different coding . &quot;
&quot; when you have edited a file , you can choose which coding to be used to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing command , they might not be able to operate with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be done with 8 @-@ bit ASC@@ II . ) With this option one can set the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing command . &quot;
place this off to supp@@ ress Her@@ vor@@ s of changes in white characters in the text or review column . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ign@@ oring C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is available only if you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences between two files are compared . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed beside the normal still a second over@@ sich@@ ord column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes one wants to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . Bl@@ end simply the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
order the compar@@ windows side by side or over@@ each other . this can also be useful for viewing of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide in@@ correctly to merge the files together . a simple click starts the assem@@ bling and use the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last sources file as pre @-@ issued name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the file , then the name of the last used output files will keep up . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , she will first hand over to this remote command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own refer@@ ential parts , which can be used for example . you can use this function for example to cut off parts or to correct the instruction . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , she appears first to be given to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command line is used . you can write your own preferences automatically . each input line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to enable the user to provide more flexibility when placing the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program that . the good news is , however , that in most cases , or perl completely suff@@ ice . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for tim@@ len@@ ders to convert : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * \ 1 in the first Kl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ couple . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the text found in capitals .
CV@@ S and other version control systems are used to insert a key@@ word ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . * \ \ = BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ _ BAR _ He@@ ader \ \ = \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; s &apos; required because $ \ &apos; / \ \ &apos; s &apos; is necessary because there would mean $ a special characters and end the line .
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you like this regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ign@@ oring of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ fam@@ 3 . but it is well known as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for hands @-@ ab@@ net@@ . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ v - &#93; / / g &apos; Je@@ zi@@ pp between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing , so somehow be deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ aliz@@ ations at one time . then you can separate the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; use to separate the compositions from one another . example :
instead of sed you can also have something else such as perl use@@ . perl -@@ p -@@ E &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ rors / switch . \ \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs perl only ( and ) without the endor@@ sed &apos; \ \ &apos; . for example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for display and to run it up . further operations are only changing the data that is identical to Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the Zei@@ len@@ eck Pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmer must edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ cur@@ sive and merge . &quot;
... &quot; makes for every object a suggestion to bring together , you can adjust the proposal before starting , &quot;
... &quot; can this merge together and shows the simul@@ ated changes , without it really perform , &quot;
... execute selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) .
&quot; this is similar to the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of individual files very similar . you only need to specify a folder on the command line , or in the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; when three folder are mer@@ ged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no target folder was specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not perform this together . to run it together , you must select the appropriate menu @-@ button or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder you will inform a small news window on the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed until then were compared . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , it shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and each folder of the scan has been found , here in a tree is displayed here . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrows to the left / right . the directory list contains two functions all sub@@ directories with which you can set up all the folders and folders . &quot;
&quot; click on a file double , the file will be started immediately and it will appear a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the different folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail@@ window to the selected object visible . in such a case the inter@@ cep@@ hal@@ hr action can not be selected automatically . if that merge together , you will be informed about any problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the picture above , will be used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder are considered as the same as its whole content is identical . then you also have the same color . when folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for his color . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ y , which is only green , then yellow is and later when it is old . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy from B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C do not have the same fil@@ esi@@ ght ( e.g. if A folder and B file is ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects can exist , this cannot merge together . &quot;
... A and B does not have the same file type ( such as A folder and B ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist can this merge together .
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ izing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ise . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to be identical to both folders . if for an entry ... &quot;
... &quot; A and B exist , but not identical : merge together and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the invisible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; directly after the mer@@ ging copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; if two folders are mer@@ ged and the option re @-@ select file instead of selecting ( uncertain ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. sol@@ ange such defects can not be eliminated , this cannot merge the folder . &quot;
&quot; while merge a file after another one . you status column shows Fer@@ tig when that merge together successfully , and according to other messages , if something is completed , you should check a last review and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the hotel dialog the file format is selected , a diff@@ 3 further columns will display . these contain the number of com@@ for@@ ter , deleted , not white and whi@@ tish conflicts . ( the column for detached conflict is only displayed when three folder were compared or mer@@ ged . ) &quot;
you can either merge the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all entries in one time . if you have selected all inter@@ cep@@ hal@@ hr actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) you can merge it together .
&quot; please note : if you do not have a target folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode , it is used as the target , when the two @-@ folder merge will be chosen as the goal and used for synchron@@ izing A and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries will be displayed in the folder structure , even in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped through the particular entries . check these options to avoid uns@@ ett@@ l@@ ative surprises : &quot;
to perform all entries : select the directories / continue in the list -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cuts ) . to select only the current element : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can select for them a valid action . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options that sim@@ ulate and break down . &quot;
&quot; choose if you only want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a comprehensive list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads to certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( merge a single file ) , then it will pop up a scroll window ( see the screens@@ hot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are ready with a file , select the directory files and press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialogue will be released . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that can help you choose to select the cause of the problem or solve the problematic post . thus , you have the option to select a different promotion for the entry or solve the problem before you proceed . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually composed , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and guides them together in the later meeting . even if that has been summar@@ ized or not saved , these entries are considered settled . only if you change the assem@@ bling action , these entries will be brought together again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ fam@@ 3 up ... ) now has a section called directory interaction with these options :
only files that fit the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree ; separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid space : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * . folder must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as parti@@ tions . valid space : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as parti@@ tions . valid space : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files which are also ignored by CV@@ S . many self @-@ engine@@ ered files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder is specific to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files are a version@@ . attribute . in other file systems , a listing is seen as hidden . this option makes you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is switched on the default . &quot;
&quot; when links to files : if the option is off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in preference . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on . a link to a folder of a link to itself will be checked . ( note that a link to a folder of a link itself would lead to an end@@ los@@ ure . ) This option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis of each file through and displays the statistics columns . ( the number sol@@ dered , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if it is applied to files that will not contain any text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare a large folder via a slow network , it is possible to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed part cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is down@@ stream in the default . &quot;
&quot; similar to confidentiality of change . there is no real comparison take place . files are considered identical when copying the modification date . please use caution , if when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is down@@ stream in the default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating the sync mode if two folders are compared and no target folder . in this mode , the proposals are connected to merge . also the results from mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered to be uncertain , because the other file is not changed too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted , then the original version will be ren@@ amed with the .@@ ori@@ g extension it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal composite file , not only the combined folder . this option is switched on the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder @-@ assem@@ bling of individual files remains visible ; you can switch the window pond with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window directory and text window you can switch to the windows menu and switch between directory &amp; text windows between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking it . however , you can also run a corresponding menu item , without only the folder menu . once you save the result , the status update will be done and the file will not re@@ boot the folder if you merge the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status goes , however , if you read the directory again : list -@@ menu : re@@ read new &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 used this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a zi@@ pped archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syn@@ tax than local files and folders . a few things should you consider :
a path can be relatively und@@ et@@ e. or .. contained . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls these are always absolute .
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ hed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , lob@@ ster - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the specified protocol . it follows a brief list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or a folder . then , a file is accepted as a link . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility to edit privileges or change date . therefore , the eligi@@ bility or change date from the original . ( note the option confidential of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; main uses is currently being differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op initially starts the built @-@ in differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts at first always the built @-@ in difference . to kick a diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewers and then select In K@@ deck@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a part , takes a patch @-@ file in the Uni@@ fied format . then remo@@ ves &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch has to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the kon@@ quer@@ or , you can select on a patch @-@ file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ fam@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable if the original files has changed since generating the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as a part executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that merge or the compar@@ ing of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now Hei@@ st it Comp@@ are ) is already available . besides , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge together as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by reading into the sources of other programmes . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone on this path or are going to be so .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and compiled the configure script rather than the correct pre@@ fix configuration in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find resources for user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this issue . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as the same ; if however , only one @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if the lines appear next to each other , this appl@@ is , but this en@@ is in the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor will notice to any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . this important information is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking on the source text and select the button . however , this important information is not saved as a text file and it &apos;s much effort to create extra a separate file format that could save this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too big . you can always restore a certain version using a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used another editor .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text can not be extingu@@ ished . what does this mean , and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not use many colors to distinguish from differences . even more Her@@ vor@@ s would be confusing and lack the purpose . use it for another editor .
lots of good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use it , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ fam@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og into the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; around &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir is the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aker , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should nevertheless occur difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists of it . &quot;
cut ( Str@@ g @-@ X or or@@ anges @-@ distances ) copies the marked text in the marked text and delete the marked text . insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current C@@ urs@@ or@@ position and replaces the current mark@@ ings .
&quot; differences : files are identical in all folders are not in the folder structure , and therefore , not in the folder structure . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to make changes to these options the folder with the function Re@@ fresh . ) &quot;
&quot; these files are shown only to display the differences . this also includes that identical files will not be copied into the target folder . if the Target folder , these files will not already be copied , if the Target folder is probably subject to change . ( the behavior will be modified in a later program version . ) This option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are already attached to the corresponding window at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already available ) . if the lines are already available , they will be removed when clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ show of all virtual working spaces . it is quite handy to see the ongoing programs on the working spaces , to change their size , they finish or move them . this works both within a desktop and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , can display all virtual spaces as well as the applications running in running applications . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and another . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . the movement is possible within a working area and on other areas of work . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked out : when on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only been hit the two entries P@@ ager ... and Be@@ ate . if however , click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; it also has the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries to minimize , maxim@@ ize , desktop and working . &quot;
&quot; maxim@@ izes application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only , when a application was cli@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only , when a application was cli@@ cked . &quot;
this attachment marks can be marked inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager window ; s with middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces are moved .
&quot; if this field is crossed , the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager will appear ; the names of the virtual spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; tru@@ sting this field makes the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces ; it is displayed together with name , the names with ordin@@ din@@ als will be provided , &amp; eg ; 1st work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs will be shown as a small window at the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty space surfaces are displayed to enable their choice . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angle with the proportions of the program window . symbol displays the windows with its default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very quick systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager may be determined : classic climb@@ s , known as P@@ ager applications , in some other Windows units ; horiz@@ ont@@ ally shows all virtual spaces in a wa@@ ver@@ right and ver@@ tically in a sen@@ k@@ right row , which is very good for the representation on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , can be used as an alternative to P@@ ager mini@@ ature program in the check@@ box . it has the advantage that it can be altered in size , the windows as symbols or with their content can be displayed and move . besides , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right click within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent payout setting up ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment , this can not be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
open the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ gu@@ c with any text author such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI@@ . if you don &apos;t have any writing permission for the file you have to register as user root or log in to your system administrator . in this file you have to assign the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and add a value . possible values are :
&quot; as &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , part of the package base is , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE plots . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; you can enlarge with &amp; km@@ ag ; a part of the screen enlarge , as if you use the newspaper a magni@@ fier for the small printed or proper viewing of a photo . this application is intended for different users : this documentation is a full manual for the use of &amp; km@@ ag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; is a very powerful application , which is continually expanded to extend new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance calcul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; when you launch &amp; km@@ ag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; km@@ ag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . below is a larger area of the screen window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
in the default setting magni@@ fied &amp; km@@ ag ; the area around the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor like a mo@@ ve@@ ag . alternatively you can illustrate a selected screen range in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ up mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ picture at the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
&quot; want to avoid that the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the setting mouse @-@ c@@ ursor . please note that it is not able to recognize the form of the mouse . this is always the default k@@ ew ; / Q@@ t ; mouse @-@ mouse . &quot;
in the drop @-@ up mode you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mo@@ ck@@ boxes and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
&quot; move the mouse @-@ mouse in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fier window and move . this also goes with the arrow buttons . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally push the &amp; Shift ; taste , or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop @-@ window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ window remain firm and only move the lower right corner . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; has a lot of features . you can copy the enlarged image directly to the printer , into a file , to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , the picture and much more . &quot;
starts or stopping the update of the ad . the stub@@ bles of the update causes the needed CPU @-@ time against 0 .
&quot; select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very small , Ger@@ ing , means , h@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU @-@ time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; used automatically your introduc@@ tory shor@@ th@@ command to store files , opening a new window , print , new@@ com@@ ers ( with the kno@@ b document back in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlargement and smaller , etc . &quot;
&quot; km@@ ag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier , using a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier to use one area of the screen , so as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the little printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefit : from the research or artists to the web designer or vision . &quot;
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / km@@ ag ( enter either this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or launch k@@ help@@ center help : / km@@ ag ) .
&amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; was developed by O@@ la@@ f Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ midt @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are sar@@ ang @ us@@ ers@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster For@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ ag@@ .de .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , once the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor a while on the same place is rough . it is meant to help people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome ( re@@ peti@@ tive Sur@@ gical syndrome ) and those of each mouse @-@ click p@@ ains . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , once the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor a while on the same place , it is intended to help people who em@@ ulate the Re@@ action ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse @-@ click p@@ ains . besides , it can put the drag with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises in the clicking the mouse and helps to use so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can hang on pain which coinci@@ de with the use of your computer , if that is not yet to happen . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; p@@ ains helps , which are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain caused by the remedy of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result may vary for everyone . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors the mouse movements , and leads one mouse click , once you break the motion shortly . &quot;
&quot; is the smart rel@@ oc@@ ating enabled , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it has released the gaps in the mouse . move the mouse , it wa@@ its until the end of the move , before the slogan of the mouse is executed . in this way , you can run the drag a little practice , but you get used quickly to it . &quot;
this transi@@ ent time must be pet@@ ri@@ fied following the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
&quot; is Intel@@ lig@@ entes slide , the speed of shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set off , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after downloading the mouse button wa@@ its before it can release the mouse @-@ mouse , if in the meantime no case for the mouse is done . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; we now support the clicks through mouse @-@ mouse . this function creates a long way to right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ est@@ k@@ es.@@ txt files , but it can be changed afterwards . &quot;
&quot; when the sound appears , you can reduce the reaction time to shor@@ ten the reaction time . open the sound &amp; Multimedia , select there Sound System and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound @-@ bu@@ ffer , which you can adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , is marked &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . with GNO@@ ME or other window environments , please click the respective documentation to determine how you start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; all settings return to the values that were set when opening the dialog . have you already pushed the button button , the settings will be returned to the state after the last pressures of it . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with preference . in particular , the smart rel@@ oc@@ ating should be placed first . if you then acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the automatic mouse click later , you can later make up the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the answer times of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : the clicking on the neutral constitu@@ ents of windows or in places in the browser window which do not link to un@@ certain@@ ed reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places , until you would like to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ ckl@@ ed , you should clean@@ se your mouse . it is usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that touch with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to pick out the mouse button . how this happens from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole , into which the bul@@ let was used . the dirt and so@@ iling stops can be easily covered with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el scrap@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started an aw@@ aking process . if you use in this case the smart move , meaning that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end with the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use one other window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is to carry out even a mouse click . there@@ with , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset ; you can continue to work as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and put the c@@ ursor to another passage . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the c@@ ursor on where you want to have it . but if you do not want to push the mouse on a neutral area of work space , if you do not want to create a keyboard . secure zones for the mouse buttons are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the cover lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t make it to edit this text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle and re @-@ copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or want to insert it once again . here , some advice is likely to prepare . here are some advice on it : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move , if you just start working with km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead of using the mouse button , while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and there again the mouse @-@ mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . therefore , every@@ times when you played a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the smart move starts . later , you can also use the smart rel@@ oc@@ ate without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be used , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X window ; be installed . that should be the case in most systems . &quot;
&quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble clicks is only available , if the system has a sound@@ card and l@@ oud@@ speaker and it is correctly decorated . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button down as soon as the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor is short missed . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and those who are be@@ ating the an@@ tigen of the Mau@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you can also be con@@ figured that a certain time is waiting for a gyp@@ sy process begins before the mouse is loos@@ ed . in this way , the drag@@ ging and procedures can be carried out with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; km@@ outh ; is a program , with the mu@@ te user can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; km@@ outh , mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the inter@@ lock of the propositions which are again to be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left with screens@@ hot ) enter the command , which will later be used for the voice output of text . for further details please refer to the description of the furnishings . &quot;
&quot; on the second page you select the default textbook . from the text text books you can often use the text passages , without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third hand ( right screen ) , you define the dictionary for the vocabulary . &amp; km@@ outh ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each words . in addition , you can see the wor@@ list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly letters are included in the vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; it is clear and essentially a input field for the keyboard input of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screens@@ hot ) and a dis@@ memory of the already pro@@ filed phrases ( the upper white field in the screens@@ hot ) .
&quot; if you have cons@@ ated correctly , you can input in the input field the propositions you want to listen . each ges@@ pro@@ ch@@ ene set is attached to the memory memory . you can select from these propositions which are again to be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu @-@ associated settings of km@@ outh ; establish ... open the setup dialog of &amp; km@@ outh ; this dialogue contains two cart@@ els , voice @-@ over@@ s and attitudes , the page Wor@@ ter@@ tran@@ ology and the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language services . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the map @-@ map , enter the command to call the language generators . in the drop @-@ field below the input field , insert the text en@@ coding firmly , with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; know two ways to pass the text . select the cross area , if the text is left as default to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross area is not selected , the text is shared as a parameter . you can use the following dimensions : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command of the language version depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation regarding your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with ec@@ ct@@ ts@@ d as a language service will use &amp; km@@ outh ; as first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings are available on this page . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is caused by the short@@ cuts or through the choice of a text message in the menu text &quot; &quot; text &quot; &quot; menu or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of instant , the chosen text runs directly spoke and added in addition to the storage box . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text message will first enter into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down selection of the editing window , you can define whether the text password can be saved at the closing of the editing p@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text messages , the book will save the book . if you choose any changes , the text password is not saved . select on saving queries , will be saved &amp; km@@ outh ; ask if the text password is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the site vocabulary contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; km@@ outh ; a selection field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field , you can select the currently used dictionary for vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons on the side , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or export the order of books or export them to a file . below the list you can setup the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; choose for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh , it reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each words can be obtained simply by count of occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to include only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are assembled and how this weight is to be wei@@ ghted .
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; km@@ outh ; newly constructed words automatically introduces into the dictionary , you will generate a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window to process text pass@@ agen@@ books is double @-@ divided . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part , you can edit a select entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text Passage or the per@@ missible buttons . if you have selected a text password , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text passages , or books add or select text passages and books you can either go through the selection in menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a pop@@ up menu . &quot;
the order of text messages or text passages can be changed by drag with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; alt .
&quot; the chosen text is cut off and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the storage storage . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text will be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the storage storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if the text is located in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the storage storage . &quot;
&quot; is this menu items crossed , the tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is default on the menu bar directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the refined left side and pul@@ ling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; is this menu items crossed , is a narrow cor@@ p@@ est in the bottom part of the main window with hints on the state of &amp; km@@ outh ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;

&quot; probably you have the command for the voice @-@ over@@ s not correct or not completely entered . open settings screens ; setup ... , open the page General settings and enter the instruction for voice output on the map edition . ( see setup dialog for language syn@@ thesi@@ zers for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a voice @-@ issue system of the University Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are currently supported . the license allows to use festival for free and without restrictions to continue . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of command line for the attitude of the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command for voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; wel@@ ded language generator . currently , he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions to continue . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . language version is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched as default output . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ emen into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ry , therefore you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to transform the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under acceptance that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA can be installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to add the last sign of the text so that an additional character must be added . the complete command is therefore more costly than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ) echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ F / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data should be sent as default .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which is available to all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interfaces for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ over@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as the cess@@ ation of language generators is carried out only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; km@@ outh . &quot;
&quot; to setting up the site K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is displayed in the dialog dialog of &amp; km@@ outh ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; successful use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and in addition memory for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration . &quot;
&quot; km@@ outh ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak to text through the computer . it is a list already stored pro@@ chen@@ er propositions which the user can always re @-@ en@@ umer@@ ated again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer must be a language syn@@ thesizer installed .

&quot; marriage you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , you have to install program Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher and setup correct . see also &quot;
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card @-@ card speaker is displayed . see also if you have booked at least one subject , the card @-@ card is posted . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ syn@@ thesi@@ zers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or such that is used in volume or speed . you can also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least use a speaker before you , since the program speed @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher would otherwise use the standard speaker . &quot;
different actors for the same syn@@ thesi@@ zers are comparable to several printing reports for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the kart@@ ing box , the cart@@ el card is shown again . this will also automatically launch if you have kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and yet no speaker is set up . &quot;
&quot; all the fully equipped speaker appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output , if an application is no rec@@ iter . &quot;
&quot; click with a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; click with a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; click on this button with a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list below . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; desktop system ;
&quot; select here a voting type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a female and female vote . &quot;
&quot; click here , appears on the new speaker at the map ticket . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to cart@@ el General and check if voice s are activ@@ ated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; k@@ de starts . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to pre @-@ read text messages to create and manage text applications . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one subject , you can launch the voice @-@ output system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card box , to open this card card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this cross @-@ field to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; system to activate the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS @-@ Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this start is successful , the cart@@ el card is displayed and you can make text entries and read . see . remove the mark@@ ings , K@@ TT@@ SD is attached and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field must be activ@@ ated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; this attachment marks and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is automatically appearing in the system range of the Control Panel , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ read is complete . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row you can start text applications , ab@@ ort , stop and resume . &quot;

&quot; the cart@@ el orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the kart@@ ing , and cross @-@ boxes there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de , you can read the text of the displayed web site . check out the text that should be read , and select in the main menu tools text . after a short time the voice should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML are also read , and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the expanded text editor of &amp; k@@ de , you can pre @-@ read text first . please check the text that is to be read , and select in the main menu tools text . then , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; Kate ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta . &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which you can notify you of events . you can also read the text of these messages also from &amp; kt@@ on ; &quot;
&quot; in &amp; convers@@ ational ; the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de , you can set up different kinds of messages . you can then set up a message in which your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then pre @-@ read the IR@@ C post @-@ post text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ fy , appears a menu notification noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . those here possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for string qu@@ ettes offer a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it &apos;s a good example . you &apos;ll find the tags br and b out of the news that can be sent out , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as a means . read on it too . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; are filters not required .
&quot; in filter@@ ing the text is edited , before it is sent to the Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation to select incorrect words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select an appropriate language and speaker , or to deal with certain shortcomings of language syn@@ thesi@@ zers and its votes . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filter@@ ing , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguish four kinds of texts . &quot;
the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will pre @-@ read all other entries and keeps these orders . if the issue of screen readers have been read , the raised orders will be continued . &quot;
warning have the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor will be hot . a warning has priority and keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the warning of warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example for an application to read the messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be viewed with &amp; km@@ outh ; someone who just leave the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read on this .
&quot; the rest are simple text@@ books . each order you encounter from the card orders , is a textbook . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have text applications . text entries are intended for the publication of longer texts which have no special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order species are shipped in queue , except the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ reading , this issue will be stopped and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen advertisements . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are running as modules . in future it can still further types of filters .
string qu@@ ettes replace parts of a text by other text . the extension parts can be delivered either as words or as regulatory fr@@ ame@@ works as : - ) by text or for the format@@ ting of messages from &amp; convers@@ ational ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ former use a X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to convert to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; XHTML ; are some X@@ SLT files to the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with inter@@ viewer , you can submit orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which has sent the text to &amp; desktop . if you have sent a female voice to an example , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filter has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a voice @-@ over@@ s . if the filter does not exist , he will not exist the text unchanged at the next filters . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; alert to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent it through all activated filter which is installed on the page below . the processing through the filters is carried out in order in the list from above . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the fully equipped standard filters . is a filter not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are lab@@ elled from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below are displayed below . &quot;
&quot; for the installation of string inspection filter@@ ing , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as compar@@ ative pattern . will these patterns be found in the text , then the text will be replaced by the associated replacement text . large and small @-@ write @-@ write will not be observed when compared to the text box . &quot;
type a name for your filter . you can choose the name you choose from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string . the list is shown in the sequence from above to below .
click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save the current list or delete . download a list of a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is only applied , if the spokes@@ person speaks for the scrip@@ tw@@ ist one of the languages here . you can also select several languages if you click the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l . &quot;
&quot; is here a value registered , the filter is used only when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by Kom@@ mat@@ a . examples : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application ID run programs receive you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must leave you away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be used .
&quot; the string filter filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in box coding filter when match . are all input fields blank , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the string filter for regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by in@@ sig@@ nia ( Space ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find no guide for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de , editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions , you can call it in the di@@ alogs or editing . the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT files from a format into another format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such modification . however , the aid program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system . &quot;
type the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H is also enough x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the inter@@ loc@@ ator filter , you can send texts to a particular speaker , who is set up on the map ticket , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can also define that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter transm@@ its , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program pres@@ enter the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sending and the properties of the ticket controller , you can write the chosen spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is used in case the text contains the given regular expression . is to be installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions , you can call this with a click on the button to get help at input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you specify the characteristics of the desired filter@@ ing conditions . if the text displayed the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to view the desired requirements . click on the button to view the dialog box . &quot;
use these buttons to store or load your intercom settings or delete all settings .
&quot; the intercom optional filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry in box coding filter if applicable . you need to apply at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , of &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer lend their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD on &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD are added , so that a syn@@ thesizer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice @-@ over@@ s API by &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is are available on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface between &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ op@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; here , text of the text can be read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , enter : &quot;
open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . start only rec@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesi@@ zers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ formation filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you have to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . you must also do that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and using the &quot; &quot; variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation appear to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so that whole propositions are printed or only gi@@ b@@ ish , what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure the option string will be adjusted to the correct value for the appropriate language . are there problems with certain signs or words , these may be solved by a string filter filter . &quot;

K@@ T@@ TS also works with any language syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or obsolete . therefore , drag the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages at rate . take a look at the websites of kt@@ oria ; for information , which are not included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; program uses a adap@@ table module for language syn@@ thesi@@ zers . if you want to expand for use of other syn@@ thesi@@ zers , please contact the developer team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for supporting SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . de@@ bian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile and compile it , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ ra@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source texts of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from source text , you have downloaded or downloaded one night out of date , install and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , if Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher works properly with your language syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher has to be developed so much that the installation of Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher is not directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is de@@ composed into individual movements . the user can with@@ hold sales - or decre@@ asing , the output will stop or de@@ bur@@ st . &quot;
&quot; if an application can give text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is possible to specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . if you have set a speaker , the language is English and its gender female , this is automatically the most suitable speaker . if you choose to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker is chosen , see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the map subject speaker , click here to insert a speaker in the list or click on Edit Web . as an example , the module of the module is shown for Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found under . &quot;
type the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included you will have to enter the festival .
&quot; select the text en@@ coding for text , which is handed over to the festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is made automatically that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders make volume , talk speed and ton@@ height of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regul@@ ators , and this grey will not be displayed , the voice chosen by you do not make these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this crossing field , these voices are already loaded when starting to C@@ TT@@ SD , so ( for large storage power ) the first set is syn@@ thesi@@ zed faster . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ area cannot be selected , you still have no speaker ( or forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; is this cross @-@ field marked , is shown at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window menu . otherwise , the program window is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this attachment marks and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not yet released , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD appears as a text . this way , you have the option to read or use it otherwise . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application that has set the order , the number of the order , the number of propositions and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row you can s@@ add@@ ling in the order , which is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or with@@ drawn . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cart@@ el cards ) will be reduced and subject to the symbol in the system section . click on this symbol to show the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the map for audio . see also &quot;
&quot; here are only text entries listed and managed . issues of screen , war@@ nings , war@@ nings and messages are not shown . further information on the pro@@ type types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; can be found in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio version . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled ; either without support for the corresponding Audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output is to be used , select the audio output . if no initial module is displayed in the list , you have to select at least one module . if you have AL@@ SA selected , select the PC@@ M device . &quot;
make the talk speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % is equivalent to half a half and 200@@ nbsp ; % approximately the double normal talk speed . so that these settings can be implemented must be installed so@@ x .
apply to the new settings for the current &amp; desktop system ;
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are decorated in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this map , you can create special promotions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of Langu@@ ages : &quot;
the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is presented to all other entries and keeps these orders . after the issue of screen readers have been read , the raised orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the issue of news and normal text . these orders will continue after the warning of warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can walk with &amp; km@@ outh ; nevertheless someone welcome the room . &quot;
&quot; will be a text order interrupted by a message , warning or output of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audi@@ ts in the queue . &quot;
&quot; the audio file is always played , when a normal text order is interrupted . if both In@@ lei@@ ding sound and introduc@@ tory message is active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; settings on this card map apply only to normal text applications . for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of screen , there are no particular promotions , if these are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ not@@ fy news can be read , launch the sm@@ p@@ gr and click messages . the card @-@ card noti@@ fications appears . &quot;
&quot; select this cross @-@ field , to turn the pre @-@ read of &amp; k@@ de ; check @-@ off . this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications before . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications before which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre @-@ read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or remove events to the list , if you click on the button &apos; button , appears a dialog where you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; will send if someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing different , are of &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
use this selection field to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event occurs . you have the following options :
&quot; if you have selected users selected text selected , enter the desired text . you can use the following dimensions : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the characteristics of the required speaker . default select the speaker , which is shown in the list on the map ticket , as the top entry . see it too . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . is a particular action specified for a certain event . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of certain application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the button save to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . use the button to load stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all entries are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for voice output , the speaker speed , the volume , the sex of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3C standard . &quot;
currently &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) because this is the default voice , the festival is used in the SS@@ ML edition . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound situation in the festival configuration dialog cannot be set on 100@@ nbsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ S filter ) . SB@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences , as only the first sentence can be syn@@ thesi@@ zed , not the whole text order . this way , you can also jump or stop on the map cards or stop and ab@@ ort , even if the language syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported . &quot;
here you can see the typ@@ ing bor@@ der@@ less filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up a pro@@ posi@@ tional _ filter filter automatically . you can add its settings or add further typ@@ ing bor@@ der@@ filter filters but it will get off of it .
&quot; the easiest way to try and try the setup selection through . switch on the map selection , which speaker is chosen . therefore , you will be able to change several features and check how the selection of the speaker . you have to course re @-@ installed more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; then faster with the pre @-@ read can begin , since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole block , which can last very long . &quot;
&quot; if you will then send text contracts then on the map for orders , even if the language syn@@ thesizer can not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal cluster filter filter is automatically set up when you start el@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it can not be removed only removed . change nothing about this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional expression ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the typ@@ ing limits ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the typ@@ ing identi@@ fier automatically from the text . note that the standard identi@@ fier filter reserves the character .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ news ( k@@ ron@@ eous ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from Ver@@ tical bor@@ der@@ filter filter , you can insert this once again by placing the in &amp; kt@@ ts ; reserved file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the map selection , you can write the intercom settings for application . the map ticket will be displayed when &quot;
use of the standard intercom ( the top on the map ticket ) . in other words : there are no inter@@ locking properties .
&quot; the use of the most suitable speaker , which indicates all the properties of a building speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker . if you choose the settings of the speaker , choose &amp; ct@@ ts ; this speaker is chosen . otherwise chosen &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from the most frequently asked features . &quot;
&quot; select the method for the input of the required consultation , by clicking on one of the selection buttons . &quot;
&quot; select the properties of the required intercom . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything . &quot;
&quot; select this tab , if the property is to have priority than other properties . you can also set up several mark@@ ings here . &quot;
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in adju@@ sting the issue , this property is always used as a priority feature . it is the only case when you possibly want to specify the attribute , if you know that a certain application text is sent in another language other than that in the work environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field of speakers , which corresponds to the following , click the button kno@@ b , and then use on speakers which corresponds to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 for the last text order in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the entry 0 required ) .

&quot; G@@ stre@@ amer is over@@ thrown and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was finished . probably , you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST register . if the problem is not solved , it may not be an compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update and un@@ install g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audi@@ ts about AL@@ SA does not work when I would like to play music at the same time . if I sustained a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message displayed : &quot; &quot; to open PC@@ M &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent an equal opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I loaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr doesn &apos;t show that voice .
&quot; add to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int / or the new voice . when this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL to which you found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the map audio there is a setting of speed . so that this works , the program has to be installed so@@ x and using the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thesizer systems such as festival Interactive offer itself on the map for fix@@ tures . depending on the chosen voice , this active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the intercom speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is because the HTML has been transformed into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ al@@ locate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML . ( see ) or if you are quite cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t make it to be read that websites are read with a female voice . I have set up a female film speakers , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not appear to function . thus festival does not make any mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber is the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a string fabri@@ cation filter , and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer sat@@ anic or with@@ stand . on the cardboard box , the order is just one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters ( point , frames , com@@ mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter . use for this sign instead a filter for the typ@@ ing limit@@ less detection . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio version . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and launch a further update . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with stand in July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not have a real l@@ enti@@ ls . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the current set will still be read yet . &quot;

&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is revealed . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; desktop . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are supplied with festival . would you like to read web pages , you have to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on disclosure . &quot;
&quot; this voice is set up 1,@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / or / Russian / . if you submit the Russian votes you have to enter the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ril@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is normally included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions are therefore looking for the first to the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must en@@ coding an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ril@@ lic as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thesi@@ zers . then the Festival takes over the l@@ ex@@ ical analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; it creates the audi@@ ts . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ V@@ otes can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no full language version is . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generates language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival creates this by &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; required di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create from German texts Di@@ phone . you can find more information under .
&quot; in this process , additional W@@ rap@@ per code is added to Festival to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices to voice syn@@ th@@ osis ; note that the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;
&quot; IM@@ S German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ Vo@@ ices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1,@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; then download MS German festival &quot;
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package that you have downloaded . ( for use with the Festival 2.0 you do not need to translate the festival ) . add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ s@@ cm .

&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ ded language syn@@ thesizer , which was written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you have to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can use any audio height , volume and speaker speed . &quot;
the commands module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer that can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and the DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings for a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting from K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ .txt file ; create a simple interface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module will be connected to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; it can be displayed in network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting at k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have to be functional and con@@ figured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and the adjustment of the network properties allows . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed for installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed . become network devices later added , the driver must be loaded by adaptation of the following files , corresponding to the core version : &quot;
&quot; the module settings will be loaded when the option is selected in network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the index is selected . when starting the module settings , this one used to automatically detect the platform using the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform can not be recognized , the suspension selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release date is best suited . by selecting the setting non @-@ again questions , the setting can be taken permanently . when the next time the network settings will be selected automatically . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed gray which means you can only be considered , change the button mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
in the system administration mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this one is divided into three riders :
&quot; the rider network interfaces is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . by the rider network interface , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
the pres@@ ent@@ able network interfaces may be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button below ... in the dialogue device set up the device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click of the Kno@@ wing enlargement Settings displays the dialogue with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Autom@@ atic , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a DH@@ CP @-@ Server or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the automatic mode the TCP / IP settings for each system start , therefore , is no further setting required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected , according to the system , selected . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of manual can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub @-@ mask is to be defined . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , initi@@ alized the system interface in bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values given in this dialog are shown as the device &apos;s properties .
it should be assured that the IP address is not already used in the network . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on as required . installed a marked network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched on as required . dis@@ able a activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
&quot; Set the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is by default used to TCP / IP communication with calcul@@ ators in other sub@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; if on the computer there is more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the grid in which the gateway computers will be selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only be able to understand IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the machine for nam@@ esp@@ ace is a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed wer@@ den@@ .@@ DNS items may be ordered by selecting a single tr@@ ages and instructions in the list with the buttons , or descent in the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; Add ... from the Group machine to the nam@@ ing solution , a DNS server can be added . it is displayed in the dialog New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS servers and then add the button . the entry is inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group computer to the nam@@ ing solution , select an entry and then click on the button Edit ... There is the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the list specifically known calcul@@ ator may be used for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by boats , if no DNS servers can be used . in small , ab@@ locked networks it can replace the DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains specifically known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . these still can be replaced in the test version of IP , in the future version 4 . &quot;
type the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add ... The New ali@@ ases dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known calcul@@ ator and add the button &quot; &quot; Add Files &quot; . &quot; if the known calcul@@ ator has several ali@@ ases , the button add several times , and enter the other ali@@ ases . &quot;
select an entry of a named manufacturer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit the calcul@@ ator is displayed .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then by clicking on OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the settings for settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable changes to activate , in a &amp; console ; the following command must be cancelled . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net / you can download the latest version of the source text .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly r@@ pm @-@ packages ) is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the r@@ pm package and in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphi@@ cally finish as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is not sufficient , but additionally the development plans are used with libraries and others . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information is given on fundamental network technology , in the second are all discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files . &quot;
&quot; this section can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , there is only basic information on integrating the PC into a small ( home @-@ home network ) network . &quot;
&quot; currently IP @-@ networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) is operated . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large spread . from IP@@ v@@ 6 , it is expected to continue in the near future . this description therefore focuses on the IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is knowledge , which is to assign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; there is the network administrator the contact address that may be used by a valid IP address . in any case , the IP address can not simply be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a special purpose reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address con@@ stru@@ cts with the global ( internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded to the Internet , so its any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible through hi@@ ring a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks they are usually used addresses in the area of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is big enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually put on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all the hosts participants are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first one is the so @-@ called standard route , the two @-@ line @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = its own machine ) . the default route is required for IP forwar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in your local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an independent lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically dynamic at DSL connections , so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections there is no other content defined . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; S@@ USE , it is known that this file is fail@@ ingly sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; it appears der Standard @-@ k@@ de . in case you choose to fold , see that there are two extra &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; specific options in the dialog dialog . &quot;
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own extended missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example vi@@ xy @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the schedu@@ les of the user . &quot;
an PO@@ SIX @-@ compliant bed &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to find time and date .
&quot; &amp; k@@ dated ; is a backup program for dis@@ ks on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the first set was to answer a surface for tar that set out the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to quick , selective un@@ pack . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife was : how much longer does it take ? how much longer does it take ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be involved by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen on three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ult the band back and reads the pre@@ tension of the bank@@ rup@@ ture . recognis@@ es &amp; k@@ dated , the vor@@ s on the tape is not , you are asked if the band is format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ ann , it looks for the appropriate index on your plate . can not be found , you will be asked if the Band@@ index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; if everything is smooth , the symbol is changing for the band@@ or@@ bit , to show that the band has been incorporated . the status of the volume may now be searched out by fl@@ ap the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the belt , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dated , given by a change of symbol for the tape that the involvement of the band has been solved , and shows a corresponding message in the stat@@ us@@ bar . the band can now be rejected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be dated &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; a strap must be format@@ ted before you can use to store data . this process does not need to be format@@ ting in front of the format@@ ting , it must be done before you are format@@ ting from the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; it is usually done a format@@ ting of the ban@@ des ahead , DAT @-@ drives in the same way . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dated , with the format@@ ting of the belt . all the data on the tape is lost ! after the end of the format@@ ting the band will be automatically integrated and used . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the obvious files . this can happen on three ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or a folder in the local file tree , only this file or the folder is secured . &quot;
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile specified .
&quot; select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured . &quot;
right click on the local file tree and choose to pick in the menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been introduced , the dialogue opens up for backup . in this dialogue you can even examine the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will be securing . the dialogue shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
highlight a file or a folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or the folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check@@ box . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu item .
&quot; once the test process has been started , the dialogue will appear for verification . in this dialogue you can once again review your selection and change the work folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the verification , the dialog appears to be examined . this dialogue shows the progress of the exam and the remaining data and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the recovery , the files must be recovered , marked . this can be done on two types : &quot;
&quot; select a file or a folder in one of the archives , which belong to the band@@ or@@ bit . it will be restored only the selected file or the sub@@ folder . &quot;
highlight the desired files from one of the archives with a bun@@ ks . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are restored .
right click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu item .
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialogue will appear for restoration . in this dialogue you can once again review your selection and change the work folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialogue will be re@@ producing . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process and the remaining data and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ inde@@ file from the band &apos;s content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types from the band : &quot;
&quot; in this way , a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings is laid out . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current work folder , where the backup is supposed to take place . the list of entries will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folder that are listed under backup files , that only the files are stored in the same file system , such as the folder . folder , which are installed on other fil@@ es@@ ystems . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to as@@ certain what files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be saved to have changed since then . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last un@@ incre@@ mental backup . &quot;
delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file in front of the call of tar . this means that all files are backed up and created a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files used to be completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the Settings menu item in the menu Settings . you can make your settings on the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the band@@ or@@ bit ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ring version of the belt .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dated ; before the tape is involved the command will load the drive . with some drives , this can be done before reading or writing operations . &quot;
&quot; is the option switched , temp@@ ted &amp; k@@ dated ; the dro@@ pping to lock the belt plant . maybe this setting does not work on all band@@ or@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; the band automatically ej@@ ected the band . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy @-@ Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; is the option switched , temp@@ ted &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ ei@@ c block@@ age support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must communicate &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band@@ width . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a volume format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is shown as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The tape ID . the format of this string is calcul@@ ator : seconds , where calcul@@ ates the full name of the system , where the volume was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds since the band has been format@@ ted . &quot;
the Band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar news that let itself directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not an incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup job . this symbol is only active when a tape is integrated .
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for operating system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system offers the various protocol files ; experienced users gives quick access to information about problems that can occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system depos@@ ited the various protocol files .
&quot; furthermore , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore tries to provide several advanced functions , with their help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful features . this includes :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are illustrated in further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screens@@ hot , looks &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ atic ; functions available , with their help to filter the single protocol @-@ lines of a protocol @-@ file easily fil@@ tered and filter@@ ing . the individual options for sor@@ ting and filter@@ ing are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting the system is trying &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ atic ; first , the most important protocol @-@ file system - to open it . it will not be displayed with system administration right . the protocol @-@ files normally can be found in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually don &apos;t use any permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar , in order to filter according to a selected crit@@ erion or in a given string . the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically , so that only a protocol information is displayed in the default settings , if in one of the columns the string is displayed in the filter string . &quot;
&quot; you can also choose from this point of course a different entry . select the string included in the filter@@ ing file system , and also contribute to the filter@@ ing the name of a process , which shows you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ atic name ; all protocol @-@ lines which have been sent or created from this process . &quot;
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol @-@ lines . protocol @-@ lines of level errors are displayed with a con@@ spic@@ uous color as a protocol @-@ lines of the level notice . the colored presentation of protocol @-@ lines can be switched on this option .
&quot; for example , you only want to display a certain process ( e.g. in the system prot@@ ok@@ oll or in cr@@ on protocol ) so you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , such as you want to examine the output of a particular command such as for example to start the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to add new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new upcoming protocols lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage the window . once you have selected a sub@@ window , choose a protocol on display . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ org. &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ;
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de , System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system rapidly develops into the standard for controlling the program start in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it bin@@ aries is among / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important , because perhaps anyone might try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without a rein@@ st@@ allation and re @-@ format . therefore , you &apos;ll make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files from a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following more folder : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start with high @-@ level system or change on a different Run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; transmitt@@ ing ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services include not such things as the date , which will only once start . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
r@@ c.@@ local should be related to / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems do this file even though it really doesn &apos;t have much use to do so . you can also want to make a r@@ c.@@ 1 in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a bit out what to do with the seri@@ als .
&quot; the kernel looks at different points according to the in@@ it program , and starts the first that he finds . &quot;
&quot; the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab , you should see a row as the following : &quot;
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre @-@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to edit it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab from hand and edit the 3 . be very careful when you re@@ boot the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter it -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that in this folder you will find no right files . instead , each entry is here a link to any of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how does and stopping in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written so written , that it is an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually launch these scripts actually from hand on the command line as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the a K includes , the script will be called through the argument . if it includes a S , the script will start running with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server Run@@ level , that leaves only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; transmitt@@ ing ; , network &amp; etc . , beyond that , I could also have a user -@@ run@@ level ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; here , you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or a different time advis@@ es is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry out of the area of Avail@@ able system services at one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts between Run@@ lev@@ ers , or change the position inside one levels by moving it somewhere else . this happens then the entry from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens if they draw an entry out of the area of available systems services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you prefer to copy them into a new area . to simply select it on a new Run@@ level , you need to dial it from the menu Edit menu or select from the context menu , even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of a single application can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to include the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : presently there is no way to restore entries , which were thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) and the C@@ ursor buttons to make a selection of - or below the previous ones . &quot;
to move an entry into another Run@@ level you move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X use ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( including C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a contract manually , press the input button to open the properties dialog . use the tab@@ ulator button to change between different fields . close the dialog by clicking the button , or press Es@@ c to take the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are extrac@@ ted in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they will be stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the default Run@@ lev@@ ers , and now the machine starts off @-@ resistant . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single one and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default Run@@ level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running the Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you must edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual for distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way , such as system services will be launched in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are required ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) end up just without message , if its configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation applies to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient , the chapter adjustment of &amp; k@@ user ; to be read . &quot;
&quot; once you have made modifications , you have to save this . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry Save in the menu File . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user interface and the user list . to select the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ clicking on the entry . it appears the dialog &apos;s or group features . &quot;
&quot; some card maps are only shown when you have extended system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a cart@@ el card will be activated on which you can make individual settings . further boxes may appear , if articles are installed or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
the map password appears if shadow -@@ passwords or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD -@@ Uni@@ ces are installed .
&quot; this card card appears only , if for at least one embedded file system space inter@@ restricted ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , the data restrictions are made in KB . &quot;
these parameters can be adjusted for each file system separately . the current fil@@ es@@ ystem is selected with the help of the field of fil@@ es@@ ystem .
&quot; the cart@@ el card groups inform@@ s about the group &apos;s members . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the field Prim@@ ular group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the big field . &quot;
&quot; the group features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select notes from the menu user or group or click on the matching &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; button . editing or delet@@ ing the selected user or the selected group . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot Manager , remove and change the boot system , remove the standard operating system , remove , modify OS , change , change and more . &quot;
