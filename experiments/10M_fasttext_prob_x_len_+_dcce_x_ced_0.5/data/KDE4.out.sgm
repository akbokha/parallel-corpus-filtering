<seg id="479">Digitised: presents three different tools to the furnace. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool to tightening. it is very fast and easy, but it is especially in dark areas, granular images."</seg>
<seg id="481">Unshark mask has been working at the contrast of the edges to look for a picture. actually it's not a bit more mental to remove it and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"focus is possibly the best of the three, because he really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters for adaptation."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitalized pictures need a correction of the sharpness. this is due to the digitalization process colors with only minimum differences. the same phenomenon can be observed when dyes are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more downscale sharpening as normal cameras for the private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG-images often a camera of internal scams have been applied. pictures in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner always apply a scrolling, already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this deactivate, you will get in control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the scrolling value. this can call you with the menu entry."</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should be careful with caution, as the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges. in general the need to focus on the menu navigation. you can also achieve further information and a comparison of all techniques for the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is crisp. the solution, the image has a little soft to draw, is considerably easier than it to sharpen. use the tool for soft drinks with the menu button Korrigid softness and experiment with something with settings. the presumes on the right side of this dialog will show you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can see you here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help edit the image. the prefables shows the issue of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and amount. the standard values often produce good results and should first be tried out. an increase in radius or the amount will strengthen the effect. if you make the insharpness mask too strong, roughing and the impression of grats in the proximity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radio. you should therefore raise images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount will be added to the percentage between the original and the missed image one of the original is added. thus the strength of the sharpness is placed.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the pig value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference difference. one can thus define a minimum difference in this way, in this way areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpenes, and therefore beauty faults in faces, celains and seabsurfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred mask. the original image is the (1) and the advertised image (2). unsharp masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sponge = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitization; tool Refocus is focused on an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected deductive filter algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool seeks a picture to & quot; refocuserenquot; in which it focuses on a technique called FIR Wiener filters. this is a better approach than just trying the picture to sharpening. it is used to start a technique called FIR Wiener filters. it is used to launch better results as blurred mask. you can launch it from the menu by setting colors and focus on the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular catch is much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which led the mathematical result also from the original pixel. the FIR Vienna inverse of the Gauß's Faltung is even influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel. that causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular loop: this is the radius of circular catch. it is the most important parameter to use this module. for most images the default value should put good results. you can put a higher value if your picture is blurred then however on Heiligenscheine.</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in the correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and thorns. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter can increase values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0,1 is very poor. if the noise filter is very bad. a hard value is 0.03. a high value will continue the picture even further."</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's Schärfe: this is the radius of the Gauß'sche Schärfe. use this parameter if your unsharpened Gauß'sch is. in most cases you should use this value to zero in order to avoid violent artifacts. if you have a value unequal null, you might also need to increase the correlation and / oderden noise filter. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"Matrightsize: this value determines the size of the transformation size can produce good results, especially if you select great value for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow if you select great value for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"the storing and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any component of parameters you have set, will be saved for later and may be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cuts, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations are not immediately visible, but left unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the unzipped image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurred mask produces better results as sharpness. this could be causing this, the blurred mask has used a larger neighborhood as sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, it must be blurred masks always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the FIR Wiener Filters. it is practical, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters are always at least as good as the Unshark mask. the FIR Wiener filters is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, based on a small unfocused picture:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture was made using a analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of sharpening and digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Glätte sets the Unsharpened of the partite area in order to create a natural pose.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the color tinent enables a adapted color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool definition error correction is one of the most widely developed tool to remove not desired artifacts with spy speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the Image team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various preference settings as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available settings are below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to use the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail preservp [0] 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a more evenly credible over the image. a value of 0.9 should be sharp. please note that the details will always be subordinated in the direction of judgement.</seg>
<seg id="520">"right-addiction Alpha [0,100]: a small value puzzling in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. JPEG artifacts are best viewed with a value in the vicinity of 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0] 500]: this sets the maximum Believer factor above all enqup defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is concerned greater structures. the higher the value is set, the more the geometry of the image is estimated. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulls' effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually it is enough 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"Winkelgradual integration [5, 90]: Winkeldependent integration of anisotropen Alpha. if Alpha is small chosen, it should also be small to create a long term. you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to suit your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrale striwidth [0,1, 10]: inclusive stepwidth in pixel. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2. "</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the More of quality you get through choice of this option is only small. he doubles but the term. we therefore recommend it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons saving as and loading make exactly this. every setting of picture errors can be saved in a text file and will be loaded later again.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correct mistakes is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how images can be corrected with small artifacts. the module is set on a photo that is applied in Guatemala city with an analogue camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artifacts in the foreground that is caused by a poor film storing during the trip. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you will only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain in default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) up to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time choosing the filter per pixel and can be astonished by the picture and the color in it moves and thus minor bugs."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the scrolling stock. this value sets the pixel track down the filter down to determine the edges filter. you may need to change the edges filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter picture details can no longer be preserved and smoking or lubricate again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot be the whole smokes removed or smoke tips can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a watchful smoking or JPEG-artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Light-proof: controls the luminosity of the image. we recommend either colour or light-density to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details of the settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we suggest you either change colour or light-density to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details of the settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"Gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the dark areas, which are typically stronger to increase. however, he also won the shadows."</seg>
<seg id="541">"shock absorption: controls the adjustment of the phastisation absorption. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter's variations on variations of illuminants. if it is increased, the edges can appear too high. he may remove robbers and phasenjitter to the edges. it can remove robbers and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">"saving and loading: these buttons are used precisely for it. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set, can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded."</seg>

<seg id="545">The & digitization; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo checks.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove the Gauß's room, compression-compression and local mistakes made in digital, original or subsequent digitised images that makes the content as well as the human eye."</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and textures. the text creation is done with another tool that is carried out by the Image team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkd and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a loss of compression algorithms, it produces some compressions & quot; artequot; - small standards which are in uncompressed image. this setting should correct this problem. "</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons saving as and loading make exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later be loaded again.</seg>

<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays depending on the pixel. if the difference between the color-level threshold transcends, then the pixel is divided into 4 sigpixel, which can be followed individually and tested on further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be used with the repository."</seg>

<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most musical pieces of acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo and high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo and high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. still needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo and high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR-stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. well enough for music of young people, portable equipment and car equipment. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that can be obtained manually or fetched by the program automatically from the freeDB, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be passed / used with & kaudiocreator; and the Kodiererprogram to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with co-operation, there is often a combination of programs for the Kodierer and those parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodierors explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; titles to the keyboards (English: day) if MP3s must be coded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters must be added from:..." tt {title}... "." "</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button drawing in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freeDB is: a free database in which people can download the audio CDs, so that all others can download the information instead of yourself: & CD; titles, artists, names of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (Anders of the Ueberger, this is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music-company can be added. all the information can be supplemented by a Bummel by a & CD; business, physically or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & kaudiocreator; is actively involved a crossing field (sending an address). for the use of freeDB can be used with another (counterfeit) address than that is not used in the system. this type of configuration may not be used (This can only know the programmer who reviewed the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for the use of freeDB is set up, the geographically can be used in the nearest mirrors. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"a visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrors for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which leaking program is used to save pieces from the & CD; save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that this cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more accurately, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see for sure that the cdparanoia package has to be installed first, if this is not yet to happen."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"for saving the WAV files, the codifier and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first time you can pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a playful compression for audio data) on the tabs to address the Kodierers. other co-diers can be added to this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the Kodierer package has to be installed from the respective Linux distribution installment, before the Kodierer can be used. further information about Kodierer can be found in the chapter Which Kodierer."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a Kodierers, more information on its switches can be obtained through the input of a command like lame -help or lame --help in a consoles window (eg; Console) must be replaced by the name of the installed code."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the establishment of the device drawing of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) installed. try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong."</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general MIDI MIDI output. in this case the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events translated into events that understands the synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet and thus always leaves a trumpet, if originally a piano should play."</seg>

<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you must edit the appropriate file from hand (using your favorite author)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that stores all the required realizations for the playing of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section that may seem as often as desired. prerequisite you have a different text ID (see below)."</seg>

<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard is pictured. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is believed that the GM-patches in the right sequence is (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"optional AllkeysTo M is needed to place all tones, that this instrument need to place the tone with the number M. if your keyboard enter a gun (e.g. with clay 60), you can make a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun signal), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch, with which each tone represents another percussionist instrument (drum, basin, Maracas & etc.), and not the one, in which the sound also means the same drum (as to possess some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">KEYMAP section is needed to indicate how sounds are formed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section the order of rows is very important, as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">"you can use multiple keymaps for each channel, and each instrument you need to use several keymaps."</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form tones on the persioning channel. check out as an example the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to complete some channels to other channels, if you want to switch to the first and second channel, make it easy in CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings useful for keyboards that have the percussion to a particular channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-Devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered between 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"N is the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will need to be defined in front of the file. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, the keymap will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, it will always be patch x used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option Forcepatch can be useful for example to always use the lad patch on the persioning channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio is given to what relation to Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied with the value, this is calculated with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file no decimal commissions are available)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting will be used because GM gives you a keyboard that should play a pitch on the 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards to be higher in a tave. to try the right value on your keyboard, you must try a little with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole range of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you can see which sounds are played just.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument, the knob is not more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The canalview has (until now) two different views to view the played notes. the view select in the menu settings below the point edge view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed-LCD shows the speed with which one song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. for example, a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the speed, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc;. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, just as two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file consists of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you will also get a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file you can also change the single instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution (rpm, DEB) from & kmid. this happens because & kmid; without Awe support you must download and install a source of distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)"</seg>

<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be related to / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems do this file even though it really doesn't have much use to do so. you can also want to make a rc.1 in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a bit out what to do with the serials.</seg>
<seg id="2963">"the kernel looks at different points according to the init program, and starts the first that he finds."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"the default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab, you should see a row as the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre-set Runlevel 3 is. if you want to edit it, then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and edit the 3. be very careful when you reboot the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter it -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you will find no right files. instead, each entry is here a link to any of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does and stopping init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written so written, that it is an argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually launch these scripts actually from hand on the command line as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the a K includes, the script will be called through the argument. if it includes a S, the script will start running with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server Runlevel, that leaves only httpd, & transmitting;, network & etc., beyond that, I could also have a user -runlevel;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"here, you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible."</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or a different time advises is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry out of the area of Available system services at one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between Runlevers, or change the position inside one levels by moving it somewhere else. this happens then the entry from its original runlevel (or its position). this only happens if they draw an entry out of the area of available systems services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you prefer to copy them into a new area. to simply select it on a new Runlevel, you need to dial it from the menu Edit menu or select from the context menu, even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a single application can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to include the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: presently there is no way to restore entries, which were thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to enable the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) and the Cursor buttons to make a selection of - or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another Runlevel you move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X use) and add it to the desired Runlevel with inserting (including Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a contract manually, press the input button to open the properties dialog. use the tabulator button to change between different fields. close the dialog by clicking the button, or press Esc to take the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are extracted in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they will be stored by & ksysv. otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; otherwise they are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the default Runlevers, and now the machine starts off-resistant. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the LILO -Prompt linux single one and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel at a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for running the Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you must edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual for distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way, such as system services will be launched in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; are planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are required (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) end up just without message, if its configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of the & Linux; running level varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation applies to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to begin with & kuser; it is sufficient, the chapter adjustment of & kuser; to be read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"once you have made modifications, you have to save this. either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry Save in the menu File."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, user interface and the user list. to select the desired user or the desired group with a double-clicking on the entry. it appears the dialog's or group features."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some card maps are only shown when you have extended system settings (Quota) for users, a cartel card will be activated on which you can make individual settings. further boxes may appear, if articles are installed or e.g. / etc / master.passwd as in BSD-Unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2994">The map password appears if shadow -passwords or example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD -Unices are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this card card appears only, if for at least one embedded file system space interrestricted (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, the data restrictions are made in KB."</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted for each file system separately. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field of filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the cartel card groups informs about the group's members. the standard group, to which the user belongs, you will find in the field Primular group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the big field."</seg>
