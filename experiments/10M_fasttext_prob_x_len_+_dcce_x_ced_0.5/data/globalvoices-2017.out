&quot; although I visited the US for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors have been read and operated in American music . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was essentially journalist because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , like he played the Gr@@ ay Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who came with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as a Jura @-@ student , who had the top of the court with judges , who had to incl@@ ined his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was &quot; s , as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year , which I lived in Arizona , had only enhanced my admir@@ ation for the USA . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose variety is so inviting , that you can always be of , you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very warm love of love about his size .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much was written about xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he goes with its bott@@ ling @-@ minded .
he never stops along the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it , and says publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in it for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he had won at the Republi@@ can pre @-@ elections , was the highest number one by the nom@@ ination of nom@@ ination . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ra Person and asked me ?
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people that I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; like for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of Journ@@ al@@ ismus@@ ere , people from all over the world , which I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; the tr@@ umps that do not coinci@@ de with the Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix &quot; &quot; watch the game . &quot;
&quot; the intoler@@ ance is also at contrast to gener@@ osity which I lived at Sandy B@@ ahr who fought for the environment for life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she adap@@ ts her to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise advice helped me much in my career . &quot;
these people and those who em@@ bo@@ died through them em@@ bo@@ died my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump down his way to nom@@ inated Republi@@ can presidential elections , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part of his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly wheat , the presidency of a man , despite - or maybe because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ looked these things , broke me nearly the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what we have led to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and respectful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of which have been voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to win over a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that in this America they are still important ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to over@@ look a man who look down to those who look different from cont@@ emp@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( m. ) . : as much as &quot; Acc@@ el@@ ong@@ ation of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cs , &quot; words from the white in An@@ play@@ ung on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it was the great Van Jones , exactly what the America did so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you might have , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this land chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , by choosing Donald Tr@@ umps , however , a gigantic portion of the white Americas gives this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the Ru@@ der , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton had had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain of Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &apos; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; brood the crowd .
&quot; have Lat@@ ties a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answered them . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would someone , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a single and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with words : &quot; &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is this not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ umps , &quot; said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no place find in this new Americas . &quot;
and that leaves me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school in the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ eur@@ a together ?
&quot; that the music that is played in both places not only the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large g@@ arbage dump , just 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( musi@@ ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a possibility to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for their drugs use and the gangs of violence . &quot;
&quot; but this was changed after an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth had such a rar@@ er hope . &quot;
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very serious about the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi :
&quot; once they come from school , they go back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they come and play with sh@@ iny eyes and play with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the tru@@ cking day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , B@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from the Tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically on top of the biggest g@@ arbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are from re@@ mixed waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re @-@ prepared instruments that consist of local fixed waste instruments , made in a workshop for music instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez began to turn parts of the waste in instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ i@@ ting viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , guit@@ ars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , trumpet , tromb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion , all made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local o@@ ist and musician instructor , the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , are reminded of the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ sals and we had to teach in the same place that the parents worked in the g@@ arbage . the children do not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something was shown that he had never seen before : one from waste @-@ established violin .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and that The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra is called . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic g@@ arbage dump ) draws the musical performance to :
the world produces about one billion tons of g@@ arbage each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poorest , as men in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here it turns into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from tr@@ ash music around the world .
the orchestra has played his music even before Pope Fran@@ cis@@ can :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wil@@ de illegal fishing fights .
&quot; this article , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted solutions on international , practicing solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release occurs during an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices on sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , at that time , that this vessel had already operated illegal fishing waters before it sought out the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were aston@@ ished accordingly , and little incl@@ ined , to welcome a legislative crus@@ her of this kind to their co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ers , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refuse to give him one of their ports and refuse to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries which you simply re@@ formed everything &quot; , &quot; remember Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the ken@@ i@@ an fishing authorities . he is part of a team who discovered the ship and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , because of pill@@ age of the country &apos;s stocks . &quot;
&quot; at the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and resources protected , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa is a network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO Stop Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing ( Ill@@ egal Fisher@@ ies ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries , who had driven back the prime minister of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it is about illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , it is hidden because of it is extremely difficult . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions . &quot;
&quot; by inten@@ tional cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species can be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm , which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; however , while action against illegal fishing hur@@ dles were once hin@@ dered by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ dles and also by the sn@@ ail , the actions occur today in real time , with trac@@ eable on the F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can interact with each other lists of existing licenses , news on suspected activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port spec@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to mark the authorities to mark ships that are in the bot@@ ched areas . also , such suspected driving routes can be discovered , such that a ship loads his fur@@ ious fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fish @-@ licence , where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal register . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , may refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports . what means that ships could not sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay by pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owner , meaning that the illegal fishing catch is financially worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , lei@@ ding director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD in lost sales by losing its eight members of the network at H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate in East @-@ African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish farms that attracts the region of commercial fisher@@ man from all over the world . among these also these illegal fishermen .
&quot; their practices include such practices such as the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license terms , indication by ph@@ antasi@@ es , the fish protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international co @-@ operation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ bound@@ ed control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; formerly a ship could illegal fishing and a country could say &quot; You dar@@ ed my harbour . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and this exact sl@@ ack tried F@@ ISH @-@ i now to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
up to date the closed front functions .
since its inc@@ eption F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations .
it has revealed criminal networks being exposed to counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships who used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has persec@@ uted ships and found it whis@@ per@@ ed ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ POL , the international authorities to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into networks organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system that is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , suspected ships precise . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be further developed , also helps to keep the illegal ships coming up . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an NGO , which also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; for instance , some of the ships are able to switch their automatic identi@@ fier systems , which they can no longer be saved from satellites . &quot;
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system which connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team in African nations do not influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch with Google and the World Protection organisation Oc@@ e@@ ana . a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by the position of every single @-@ trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; join forces to get a better idea of who what is doing - this is simply meaning , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system uses the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only criminal , but they also deter@@ red . &quot;
ships that had been conf@@ isc@@ ated with no license earlier and hardly having consequences to reck@@ on they know they are observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the participating countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries now have a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fisher@@ man boats bought more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped to send Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow , whose use is forbidden . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , some hundreds of millions of dollars disappear by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 2015 six countries have joined together , so called West Africa Task Force . they now fight against illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety the goal is to develop even more of such initiatives and structures also in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s recently started his first big triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was travelling under false flag . and not only was the ship used without licence and were used in tow , which is now forbidden . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into the bot@@ tled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take @-@ up rules against Gre@@ ko 1 set out a strong sign that they attack against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success by many . and at the same time proof that such a particular , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works in the whole world sea . Emma Bry@@ ce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; your articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela is pointed to : demonstrations in several cities with the goal to reg@@ ain the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are considered to protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .
&quot; this picture of Mar@@ Ã­a Al@@ ej@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Marac@@ ai@@ bo , in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; after the Government of Venezuela refused to dismis@@ sed the motion of the opposition to a referendum , re@@ acted the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country into the Le@@ ere , in which they gathered together on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the resi@@ dual installation of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also run in other parts of the country - including in the low@@ land Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions of MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , located in the central north of the county of MÃ©@@ rida and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is continuously deterior@@ ating , which makes itself noticeable in everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by a acute shortage of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition witnessed in the minist@@ erial bombar@@ ding of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change ; but ultimately , the accounting of a re @-@ election of the official authorities was blocked . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , takes place in their latest article the context of government fix@@ tures : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the influ@@ encing and tissues to the highest all over the world include ( the in@@ flow rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual accounts ) and in which a serious and sof@@ tening lack of food and medicine was meant to take the chance to conquer its institutional structures and close a new government alliance . &quot;

the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday land@@ lords , and on 3rd November all to Car@@ acas on the Miraflores palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the context of the Programme of Action &quot; The return of Venezuela &quot; was held on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches which are published in real time , witnessed among other things a overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most commonly shared images shows a prot@@ esters , who calls through the protection signs : &quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot;

&quot; on Twitter there are pictures that tell about conflicts , as well as reports of oppression and mis@@ use . &quot;
&quot; particularly large waves , the news suggested about police repression in the central city of Marac@@ ay . &quot;
there the demonstr@@ ators moved back into the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed forces of the government .
&quot; hours later , they could safely leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators sought to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des @-@ state T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not carry skir@@ ts , because you could see something else , what many nation you don &apos;t have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ graphic constitutes the round that forms the extent of repression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship of the country has suppres@@ sed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a post @-@ office procedure - it was now proved in the eyes of many through the presence of sacred people on the streets .
my@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are counter@@ feit .
here is your official anni@@ hil@@ ation !
on the road !
&quot; &quot; &quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and would prefer to handle critical voices . &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches are getting more and more of frequency and intensity .

&quot; this is an adapted version of a interviews by Al@@ ent@@ ejo GÃ³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argentin@@ ean news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced from his father to show the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ean city of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of CÃ³rdoba to his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not forget his life .
&quot; starting in the brush , the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , that he watched at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years he retained the family of the family .
in the situation back then I believed that was in order .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one cannot realize that you are t@@ amper@@ ed by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ dians . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship of 1974 until 1983 , a time of state ror@@ ism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Chairman of the Intelligence Department 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archi@@ v@@ ables .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , who because of dec@@ eption in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child is charged . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows how great power has a parent over his child , and how this child has chosen a path of salvation . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base point
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy , the martial bl@@ ender . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him , and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo , and called me to identify my friend . &quot;
he said :
&quot; you are an Ar@@ sch@@ loch , you have rounded with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; pass on that pass , that they cannot bring you one day and I must save you . &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina . &quot;
&quot; that is why he offered me to go back into the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he said to me , I would be secret . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be OK , because my Father had moved me . &quot;
on the military base I had to destroy papers that heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , Prop@@ ag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da@@ un@@ practice the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
&quot; during the first and last time , he had to wait at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time he took me to get rid of me , he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just all possible - were . &quot;
all of that was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small in a ceiling p@@ aves and command@@ ed to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump silver . &quot;
&quot; on this day , I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen objects were de@@ duc@@ ted and signed me with a guar@@ dian . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open room and said :
since dr@@ ape the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I sp@@ ed in , and saw a goat , tor@@ tured on the human being . &quot;
she looked like a bed @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
&quot; later , I found out that they attached to an end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was captiv@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; they rarely en@@ forced a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to bed , p@@ oured him with water and told him a charge of 220 Volt to the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the stu@@ ank there dr@@ in was horri@@ fic ... as a dirty Win@@ del .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell right away and I realized that that the smell of a body is in need .
I was never forgotten this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do another so much sor@@ row ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was likewise charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mat@@ tresses on which naked people were captiv@@ ated with the face - all were captiv@@ ated with hands and feet .
near the entrance area people quiet at the mat@@ tresses .
&quot; when my Father noted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ st du so , Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot;
&quot; I set &quot; Why have you brought me elsewhere ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told home about it .
&quot; besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there was a man together and killed .
&quot; ( according to information of survi@@ vor@@ s of the civil society Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students of Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former following chambers . &quot;
&quot; the path on which you came here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ eness a number assigned .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra till the arrangement of above came , that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ ring &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
&quot; back then at the age of the age , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war@@ ring &quot; &quot; - how they named it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later on the military himself , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war clim@@ ates a B@@ aj@@ on@@ et or maybe military mark that one suppos@@ es to an enemy that man fights . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ r , then this is not war but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is rob@@ bery .
&quot; I always wondered how my father was the leader of the security forces , at this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it simply .
&quot; I was an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never noticed , to enter a house and to ste@@ al all things in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , And thou that you got cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not crimin@@ als ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before w@@ ut , cutting me and cried out , &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and teach you . &quot;
we no one need any other !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I had a photo of then , on which I took a jack@@ et and a wheelchair swe@@ ater from w@@ ool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he nevertheless brought clothes with you . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence , a co @-@ conspir@@ ators could have been with this crime . I conf@@ ess , no problem , they can put me to the burden what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to pre@@ di@@ ct .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearances of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ om@@ in@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find Reu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life . &quot;
&quot; one is developing and real@@ ises that it is wrong , to kill . &quot;
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have been ex@@ iled over the dictatorship people . but what they disappear ? &quot;
why children have kidn@@ apped ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could not have been put into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what they disappear ?
had these people not also passed to families where they could hand over their mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearances of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ om@@ in@@ ous act of man to do .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they put machines to eliminate the rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crus@@ hed and somewhere ent@@ ails - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even on the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought , to show my Father , was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him alleg@@ edly for all of the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt embarrass@@ ed and asked me , for the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; which they supposedly defended themselves . &quot;
then cried I :
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horrible crimes and you were forced to take me as a child to take part .
&quot; he said only &quot; &quot; Na then forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly what I did .
in 2010 I edited the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; no one can tell me , that I have taken the way . I finally told my own father . &quot;

&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word , no longer be done ( cor@@ rup@@ pe@@ sha ) , which means &quot; Elderly drivers &quot; , &quot; fal@@ si@@ bly - perhaps also with mal@@ ign@@ ant back@@ ers &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was from 1 to 20 September at electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
elabor@@ ation of the original pictures of Joshua Lev@@ ine that was often shared in social media .
&quot; the mistake was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a inhabitants of Ky@@ otos . he was also who made the local time attention . &quot;
the Kyoto Newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( English : &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate even though gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Pre@@ fecture , Kyoto exc@@ used for the translation error . furthermore , they explained that the error was already included in the text they had been checked by the transl@@ ator and that the translation was not tested on its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we truly are sorry that older people felt by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast news has become a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; vene@@ er &quot; was ref@@ utable as an adequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who are involved nation@@ wide in accidents , but certainly cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; for example , Kyoto for example , was created in 2005 1,9@@ 41 from a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents . that is equivalent to 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , we caused seniors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; with this , their share increased to 17,@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents fall down in total , the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period has increased . &quot;
&quot; the name of this article did not show comments in the light on Yahoo , showing some Japanese prejudi@@ ces apparently against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo about translation errors , including the following comments : &quot;
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; horrible drivers &quot; ) about not the reality ?
&quot; - If faul@@ ty is the translation actually not , or ? &quot;
I don &apos;t find that this is a true translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and across Asia .
the website En@@ gra@@ ish@@ .com is a true destination for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ Users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to get over , one needs two important skills : passive knowledge of knowledge to understand the initial text and to engage actively in the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in case of mother@@ language . in general , the conviction in the target language - not in the initial language - mother@@ language . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a French mother language should translate into French transl@@ ator from English to French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ Users Karl Bar@@ on .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a native language , the translations into the translation process . this may be attri@@ but@@ able to lack of understanding for over@@ l@@ apse or relatively small number of English speakers , from Japanese language . &quot;
&quot; some companies who do not have foreign employees , translations nonetheless have their internal staff , then the Japanese staff , whose English skills are made to be the best , for transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ Users Karl Bar@@ on .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ ens and pu@@ zz@@ ling propositions which are created by machine translation , show that this technique does not replace any human transl@@ ator for a long time . this is particularly true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the most en@@ ig@@ matic prints , often used T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets , are used only from styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood at all . &quot;
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ Users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least inno@@ cu@@ ous . but by large companies or from government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Kyoto uses hopefully a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protest and c@@ ens@@ ory measures to take on the Internet and television
main page of the Portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Frei@@ es surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users had no access to the Online Sender Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the website wrote of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV can no longer be accessed . &quot;
other online stations transm@@ itter recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups organized by the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros .
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Court ruled the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is connected , and recommended to use the utilities , V@@ PN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your V@@ PN .
it seems that web pages ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ ders are once again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for telecommunications them with money stra@@ ins and cl@@ ams , if they continue to report about demonstrations , since the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV , and informative national TV channels I signed up with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amazing that this is still cheaper than to buy two l@@ iter of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro was confirmed later , that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other on @-@ line radio stations . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous post @-@ research inquiries made by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , we came to use the local internet provider to use DNS . this is a technique which is incorrect to respond to DNS servers or certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or denied the request when calling on such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third stri@@ pped channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , 6 of April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV shows El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten while he was in police officers .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus the vene@@ ers of access to multi @-@ media coverage over the current events in the country are always more complicated . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shortened version of a report by Kur@@ ling , which is issued by Global Vo@@ ices with kindly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series called &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que &quot; ( &quot; &quot; flying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , in which she did not work together with the family who lived there , eat . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her graduation at the university , she returned to the house and heard , like the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that , from which something became , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga is never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay that is more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are comp@@ elled to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money over the old son or her in@@ age @-@ old daughter to another , rich family . in exchange gets the child food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that children have to pay countless days of home@@ work that will never be paid and sacrific@@ es of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract , which one cannot lift up . &quot;
&quot; this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ ac@@ go in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society , and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after graduation , Al@@ var@@ enga worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with cri@@ tici@@ des - especially young girls , affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - raised testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated by the Cri@@ me of Cri@@ me , will remain silent in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who carries her daughter to faith that they do so close their training to improve their position in society and make &quot; &quot; something out of itself &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that takes the girl with himself and whose exploitation is justified with faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education , and maybe even star@@ ving . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mis@@ led , his family will only experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they know even never about it .
&quot; in January 2016 the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n was in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in hospital , her body showed traces of fierce battles . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military service Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official in the population office .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; by the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra , long as long as with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n , until they suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply bl@@ az@@ ed practice of cri@@ c@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice for the death of the girl .
they recorded the cri@@ ad@@ ac@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest@@ ations and called for &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children registered , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to inj@@ ure the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions are boys and girls . &quot;
the neighbors of the sp@@ ar and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded for an excellent study of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was condemned to 30 years of prison .
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be landmark - when the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of cri@@ ad@@ ac@@ go in court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ min@@ tas are not only exploited as labor force ; they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when the consumer , in which her father worked out , courses had to en@@ closure , and their father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brethren had to go all work , and began to sell on the street or on the cand@@ y market to make money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the house of her employers Al@@ var@@ enga worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , they had to share the time that it was still time to learn . &quot;
she stood up every morning against five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for their employer .
&quot; for example cle@@ ans the fridge , p@@ ouch the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ i@@ fied the floor . &quot;
when the school was at the end she went home again and had time to learn .
&quot; the more they finished with learning , the more free time it had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had even had dinner for their employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga says , they never had to star@@ ve , but was also no unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she reminds me . &quot;
&quot; the library was well appointed and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some picking of the Al@@ var@@ enga , next to him stand and editorial made of opposition time such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to give the reports of official media through the regime of the dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he held it for intelligent , but did not hold it with her . &quot; the landlord had someone who hear@@ ken@@ ed , while he spoke about politics &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would learn there again &quot; bad habit . &quot; so , they believed that Al@@ var@@ enga is to speak to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the formation , which they had made it again , explains it . &quot;
&quot; it was however completely clear that she got for everything they got from them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; in school Al@@ var@@ enga has been discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which is almost never spoken , Mob@@ bing and the chic@@ ks are exposed to the school when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to go home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .

hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .

please leave you .
start from Monday if possible .
the ad got five &apos; Li@@ kes &apos; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a miserable girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came out of Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year @-@ year ni@@ ece . &quot; she really like small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote her . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the heart@@ land , who wants to work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then the fi@@ denti@@ als found in the ad once again a :
&quot; dear girl@@ friends , I have found one . I look to whether it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again , if something is . &quot;

&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to prevent systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , who had to leave the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores in Paraguay that the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , and to their &quot; wives . &quot; therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys moved to a system of slavery in which they become an easy victim of abuse and exploitation . &quot;

sixty Egyptian MEPs have recently agreed a bill for the regulations concerning the use and use of social networks .
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , user officials and users have to register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a place would be set up , which is responsible for providing citizens with permission to grant social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users need to register to user on the site with their correct names and personnel numbers , to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it failed to do so , that could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a money . &quot;
&quot; the bill introduced which consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ids and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; each time application that is run through the internet and used to communicate with other means of voice , video and text . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how the law will be en@@ forced when the design is no indication of how an Egyptian authorities want to decide how an Egyptian authorities should not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdu@@ l Satt@@ ar , Parliament Parliament and sponsors of the law fores@@ ees , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and a password to come through the fire@@ wall , Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; that could mean Egypt plans to be a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to access the network . &quot;
&quot; but so far , it is not known that such plans do exist . &quot;
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical concerning the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; research engineering &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I have no doubt strong on the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they could control the physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take them seriously , this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system that apply for citizens or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to lead them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed by the legislative mandate and the Constitutional Treaty before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance or enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in accordance with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in the Parliament in whose sense it is to be maxim@@ ised and ensure that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MPs Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy proposed a legislative resolution against cy@@ ber crime in which a lifetime sentence for those who were guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; &quot; protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ distan in the northeast of Iraq we work the Ti@@ ersch@@ Ã¼tz@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation nature Iraq to protect the intellectual Persian Leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which strikes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , it is between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are found in danger from Wil@@ der@@ y , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they can always find less boot@@ y . &quot;
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; how R@@ aza shows in the video shows , &quot; is the Persian Leopard the only remaining beast in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the prosperity of ecos@@ ystems also depends on that a big car@@ ni@@ ece is present . &quot;
the chance to see an Persian Leop@@ ards actually in the free hunting ground is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they will have a picture of a big cat in cam@@ er@@ af@@ all that breaks R@@ aza into pure joy .
&quot; as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ ine , R@@ aza passion@@ ately passionate about a different side of their country that exists not only from war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in field studies for wild@@ ly living animals and in educational programs for six years .

&quot; beginning March 2017 documented , responsible for the northe@@ ast@@ ern Japan daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to rebuild from the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; from March 2011 . a vast earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima disaster had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which was in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was an Etrus@@ can pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan in Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring tours of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iv@@ ate have been deb@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had gotten whole coastal cities away from the map . &quot;
&quot; in the Fu@@ kus@@ hima disaster , the Pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima had an atom@@ ized accident , for that reason 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
&quot; the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows made up of local view , which has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local resident . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authorities as well as survey results of those affected by themselves .
&quot; apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare @-@ houses ( either in @-@ out , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success of the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures could be found Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here , 80 percent of the planned spare buildings have been completed . &quot;
&quot; Iw@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses completed , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima has 70 percent the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , one still makes every effort to strive even six years after the disaster , evac@@ u@@ ated accommodation shel@@ ters ( no one @-@ hour , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare @-@ houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple @-@ disaster , nearly 80 000 people saw forced to live in homes and accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , more and more 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iv@@ ate also lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the evac@@ u@@ ters from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 per cent of the evac@@ uation , which is shel@@ tered after the disaster in accommodation shel@@ ters . &quot;
for Iw@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the stand of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures .
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools which were affected by the un@@ happiness , their doors to December 2016 again , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fecture . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fecture is much more difficult .
&quot; during nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iv@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fisheries have been re @-@ recorded . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have drawn up in the three pre@@ fecture of agricultural land large @-@ scale . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iv@@ ate and less than 50 percent of non @-@ destructive A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear waste , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed A@@ cker@@ el of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ ywood &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered from the tourism again , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains de@@ pressed . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate are back to 90 percent at the same level , as in front of the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in contrast , can only be 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reported that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it has become more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and among the evac@@ u@@ ated by . she asked them about the status of reconstruction and also how to find their recei@@ vers in front of the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explained :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey through to spread more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population .
&quot; the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents , that still has not been done enough in terms of disasters . &quot;
&quot; as it comes to those , who had to evac@@ u@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o paper has strengthened its attention also to the position of evac@@ u@@ ated of Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had the enormous earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also witness@@ ing the worst , cat@@ astro@@ us , nuclear accidents , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent spare buildings . &quot;
&quot; after the end of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas , most of the evac@@ uation areas are the most of the evac@@ uation in offices , older than 50 years old . they have to compete in proper containers , because the efforts to rebuild from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Iv@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is the part of the Olympic Games to take place in Tokyo . &quot;

these global links are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look carefully at this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat topics that are often less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 has been given this week in the intensive care center : last Friday he had taken him a police officers during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . land@@ far took millions of demonstr@@ ators to a protest against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ itÃ¤t Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ deer her@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors sacrific@@ ed him this Saturday and now have translated it into an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that spread within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
&quot; on the pictures there is also the face of the police officers , which is identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , military police were well @-@ known in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of an inquiry of the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with its headlines on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; would be a police officers of a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care station , his face would be on TV for six months and the whole oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided the video of Lu@@ iz da Luz , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several sanitary short afterwards to it . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective is filmed in social networks . &quot;
in the shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( approximately 2.@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to remain in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado , additional violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s into memory : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political force : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish has joined forces to crimin@@ alize the Occup@@ y movement in Sec@@ ond@@ ary schools . and now we have been attacked by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman , which has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a stroke . &quot;
police gri@@ ps
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police officers on the last Friday . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ emen continued with protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber and lac@@ ri@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the MEP Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speakers to refrain from violence against prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again the Brazilian media road prot@@ ested by clicking the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window pul@@ ley . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo is mainly known about a crus@@ hing glass window to create illustrations in a photo .
on the other hand the O Glob@@ o favor@@ ed a title @-@ story with one in fire @-@ set bus .
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window @-@ disk than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special thing . &quot;
this is also necessary to recognise if you are strictly ab@@ ide against any form of damage .
&quot; here also the term &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; gets an absurd , dis@@ proportionate effect , and the typical non @-@ violence of the military police are distor@@ ted by the headlines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on con@@ front@@ ational forces &quot; with the police . &quot;
the de@@ duc@@ tance from the ab@@ in@@ duced villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar plants across Cuba ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the popular communities Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - well @-@ known that there are no not@@ e@@ worthy sugar@@ s on site . &quot;
&quot; it is two years ago , when the activities were placed in the sugar@@ s factories . &quot;
&quot; after the circum@@ stance , the sugar@@ s industry was silent in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations , until only the sc@@ aff@@ olds ran from steel and concrete . &quot;
about 272 workers need to be rein@@ vent .
some change the work .
other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ es and bo@@ g@@ gan@@ ing daily to the factories that are still ma@@ hlen .
&quot; n@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who is open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar @-@ industry don &apos;t smoke his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the sugar tube fabri@@ ken , who are back in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene reminds yourself exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , I would be obtained the sugar@@ s factory , but the promise has not been kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar@@ s industry was already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effic@@ ien@@ cies , the bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; this message would have been a motive for alarm for the country several decades ago , but the poor harv@@ ests are not yet new . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar@@ s industry ?
the old railway line of the municipality looked already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar@@ s industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar@@ s @-@ factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories which amoun@@ ted to annual production goals amoun@@ ted to 4 million tons .
they left only factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the subjects that resulted in such measures were the low productivity of sugar plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
&quot; however , the sugar price increased from about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound remain , according to the 2016 published report &quot; &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the Roh@@ zu@@ cker exports would be around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today , the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro came into the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o in his speech on 21 October 2002 . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of restructuring at the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar@@ ro@@ ams , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training . &quot;
the same happened at the sugar @-@ hr@@ factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , about the closure of the factory , is the word that he is repeated most , &quot; che@@ ating . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
&quot; thus the place will get , they formed a full time - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first shot , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recognised documents that would be distinguished only regarding the parts , which would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister was able to det@@ ach every withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was exagger@@ ated and the letters were getting more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the nursing factory for two years and was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in farm , insured . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved against his will in the breast@@ feeding of the factory , in whose construction he was helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removed , dismant@@ led one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ station was er@@ ased .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for the workplace and services that generated the plants in the congreg@@ ations in which they were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ ut @-@ speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the present people as he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , all would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closing of the sugar @-@ tube fabri@@ ken
since 2004 sugar@@ can@@ ines has only been extrac@@ ted up into the rays .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the popular communities Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learnt that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar factory was closed , or better said than they started to keep them down , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ting the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
they have been assigned to spare parts .
without a future perspective there were also many young people to the region .
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the municipality . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant continues to be imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty harvest bring the old soldiers a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years reti@@ ring in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Lord N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear@@ er voice , there is no tail person , yet he claims the lies , which you told him not . &quot;
you have been tor@@ ment it for ten years .

first Nations @-@ young people use Hip Hop to express themselves and sustain their own culture
recording a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Ch@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

&quot; youth of the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important for them . they do this through Hip Hop , thanks to a number of migrant workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos; we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour has been launched for 2014 Work@@ shop@@ per mobile audio studios directly at schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups in song@@ writing , recording , audio and video @-@ products and live appearances . &quot;
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and in North Quebec with ten C@@ ree communities and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree Hip Hop Group The North@@ stars .
&quot; the workshop raises the fact that the young participants in discussions are topics such as &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self acceptance &quot; , &quot; or whatever comes into mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the youth are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the kit@@ es@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia tells example the history of the Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of the tears , &quot; a road @-@ section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First nation uses the motif of a video player to convey to how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite influences by globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First nation was recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
the young people involved here got some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop Hop Group which gave them a crop in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ all@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in uph@@ e@@ av@@ als , as a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like I would ever be interested in my interest
&quot; however , I try to keep my days on earth . &quot;
that is the day when you take our cry out
because we have lost our way of life in life
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t like to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and lead the way to our youth
so they can do that which they are determined by the Creator .
in the commentary box the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also added a post and adds the rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ em ( which is also published on his blog ) :
in Japan plastic bags are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant sculp@@ tural dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( either side @-@ out , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic &apos;s models &quot; &quot; ) from every meal that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there are a whole industry dedicated to producing these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small businesses that produce the British fil@@ mm@@ akers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic bags are so usually that they don &apos;t even notice any more . a new trend , however , trans@@ forms it into show@@ y cell accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
near Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ ggers it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin b@@ pur@@ u .
&quot; now in special sale , new with plastic @-@ colored mobile phone rings , as shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Islands . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collection , as in this case , cooler magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin cool@@ ness magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom of eating will become more challenging .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don has been transformed into a popular travel shell with seafood ) into a mobile phones .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone .
also this part we have produced for the exhibition at the Tokyo station .
and here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight to comfort .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phone designers allow you to establish your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or Lach@@ s@@ che@@ ated , a popular t@@ opping is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can provo@@ ke my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will probably be the one .
this interest in plastic so@@ ckets can also accept a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone @-@ stand has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and to@@ oth@@ bands from dried ch@@ opped . &quot;
further sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic @-@ bun@@ ni@@ ece can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the has@@ ht@@ ag # kno@@ b in a row .
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi that dedicated to the con@@ fer@@ ment of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plas@@ ma can be produced in fact .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports in@@ - and foreign media beyond the ber@@ ized &quot; struggle against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the susp@@ ects and def@@ aul@@ ts regularly follow in statistics only in statistics . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy , that struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict totally in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , there is hardly anyone looking for the funeral or on the churches that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone , behind each bone , in the hundreds of married tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds may never cure . &quot;
&quot; that is why the Mexican news site animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico supports the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with drug trading , &quot; ) to give this sacrifice a voice and stories of people who were told in the struggle between the prosec@@ utor authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug retailers and all the churches have to go many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( English : &quot; how fear lives changes &quot; ) tells you exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who married every weekend gra@@ ves after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , which lost in only one day their father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again on the task we have asked , go and go to gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
&quot; he was 28 , when he disappeared . &quot;
he has three children .
he worked in an e @-@ shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are at the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but it does not pay off because of demand a ster@@ ite . &quot;
where should we get this ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid of the international community . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility , and the prosec@@ ution . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excerpts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; it reminds us that violence should never consider normal to be normal , regardless of what type it occurs : &quot;
disease and Sens@@ ations@@ journ@@ alism I have been known for several years now .
&quot; I come past every day with newspaper ki@@ osk and see the title pages with images , which actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the rede@@ emed or sad . it affects how a lack of respect for the person who was once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year &apos;s cous@@ in thinks that he is big . and it &apos;s also not normal that people listen songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders , when going through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me that is , as if they over@@ tones those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they happen . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories are to blo@@ wn numbers in statistics .
the in@@ som@@ nia of humans is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neighboring village thus justified that they were up .
I think they try to argue that they remain spar@@ ed by such trag@@ e@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and sil@@ ently .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; four months of ex@@ tor@@ tion in the capital city . it describes how armed crimin@@ als was released for month money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and about how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of it never ends , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back high , if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed , the better . &quot;
they included their report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you do not know when they will discharge or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether tears would dis@@ solve my deep feelings , but the reply is no , because I have forgotten how to cri@@ es . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of the violence marked by violence .
&quot; in the introduction he raises questions about : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents worry about it . &quot;
br@@ yan is a washing and he told that he had to teach himself how to cook a bro@@ iled potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies which are living with him . this is his name for the preparation of flu@@ kes with water , sugar and dairy powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year &apos;s life .
&quot; however , they are in@@ significant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he said to him that his mother was gone . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been past two years earlier , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; as Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
the br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of judges for public security and government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Public Prosec@@ utor 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundred thousand @-@ stories stories about organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate that into the soul of the country .
few stories still live in view of the headlines . this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 provides the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data to form the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trading , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades , in comprehen@@ sible way . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ Users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ ARN@@ ING : this entry and the sides , to which it is linked , contain images , on which force is shown . &quot;
the Fak@@ ten@@ check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift up a rum@@ or or fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the years after something has been sur@@ faced ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this picture of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it is mis@@ leading to use trag@@ e@@ dies , which have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false p@@ airing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - deny not the fact that there are ample di@@ ligent reporting about events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it thro@@ ws questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a petrol trucks up the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ ie and explo@@ ded about 230 people . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became a dangerous paths , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; typically , the car@@ riages fell to the victim . &quot;
&quot; administration &apos;s representatives described a fire@@ ball , the du@@ ous houses envel@@ oping , including a cin@@ emas in the vicinity , which was full of people who illustr@@ ates the football world championship . &quot;
houses scattered and hol@@ low cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ mistak@@ able .
&quot; a photo with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ Users My@@ stic Mon@@ key , 12 . January 2015.@@ Multi@@ ere photos of the incident form the atro@@ cious scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example .
it shows chains of shortened body which is ro@@ uted on the ground as individuals they look at .
but here history does not find its end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo has been en@@ rolled several times in social media , blogs and other platforms , and may not be attributed in the context of the trag@@ e@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 the fighters of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the Nig@@ erian villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities on which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ rup@@ tions were located in roads and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people have been mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; nobody stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many have been crus@@ hed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the following time could be shown . &quot;
the reason for the attack was also uns@@ ol@@ ved but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo can be found once more than proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2.000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
you are dead .
&quot; in fact , these ab@@ used use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ ten@@ ders ; Africa Check @-@ off@@ ence to Nigeria has been documented since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was taken as a test@@ ament to mass@@ aging .
yet another step further bring personal comments such as this example from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the image from S@@ ange appeared in conjunction with the kill@@ ings of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash , published by the United Nations described those who could flee , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following on which these descriptions have brought together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from a sau@@ di @-@ Arab news side , which said in 2012 , the President of My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Bein@@ gs have said , mon@@ ks and politicians had been involved in ass@@ ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . additionally she had the picture from the DR Congo to use this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other new@@ sletters , the AF@@ P was referred to as their source , they had also acci@@ dentally written Th@@ ein His statement , but had not associated with the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings meet up to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; with a &quot; &quot; moving image search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures found in the said picture from the DR Congo very similar .
&quot; they come from a mix@@ er to private pages , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed wrong reports and have tried others trying to fal@@ si@@ fy counter@@ fei@@ ting .
&quot; we have had examples of the miss@@ able use , and brought them to the respective countries , based on which side they were published . this way , we want to portr@@ ay the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also associated with each other ) , several examples could be used for mis@@ use . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be completely eliminated ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
countries of the false coupl@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ colored countries indicate pages or servers which are still available through the examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting or fal@@ seh@@ ood .
&quot; the countries in Gr@@ ay are examples , which are according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available about Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ feit examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( directed to Alger@@ ian and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Government of Myanmar has released an opinion on what they referred to as &quot; inten@@ tional news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this jud@@ gement , which is published exclusively in English , contains references to counter@@ feit images of sc@@ aff@@ lic@@ ting molecules that run H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to dar@@ ed to kill Muslims Budd@@ hist@@ s and ander@@ ed ( which is often common by bur@@ mes@@ an nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities were found in these events , the mut@@ u@@ ity in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was a test@@ ament to the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages that were associated with it were interven@@ ed in any religious context .
&quot; instead , the goal was to focus attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media reporting rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message which supposedly was written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; over the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , translated into det@@ ach@@ et , translated it in the Vietnam@@ ese like this here in Vietnam@@ ese , and explained it to the false message . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the picture from the DR Congo has been included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other Ac@@ counts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) shows Tin@@ Eye also , but are no longer completely recycl@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data orders with UR@@ Ls and time / data stamp exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and pe@@ eling them in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original un@@ signed of 2010 , the picture ultimately bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
Fr@@ ames and Images
there are two major topics or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that passes these po@@ sts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about welding in connection with the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming has used the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated to a European or French life .
religion to understand and value human life is both important . therefore it &apos;s worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot give this pictures longer belief . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who are acci@@ dental to do the water around a tragedy . &quot;
suggest this mood of mis@@ - and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and decor@@ ating it the real atro@@ city of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the distribution of violent images was already deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that deri@@ ving from pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al , the tragedy comes to detect . sometimes , these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that for@@ ce@@ ful pictures of readers and audience is des@@ olate and to feel the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which under@@ claimed how violent media have to help others to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there are some things to discuss some violent represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for the current news reporting . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the struggle against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture may suggest something to be used in the context , or completely mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; however , every investigation of false ten@@ ders should also take into account as internationally as they can . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; blog revealed the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses in accordance with CC BY @-@ N@@ D 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( eg . un@@ transl@@ atable ) endeav@@ our@@ ing to offer a selection of words from all over the world who are difficult or not at all .
such words are available in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ cep@@ de ) and others who are rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all resist@@ ing stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt at a simple translation .
&quot; one word or phrase does not suff@@ ice , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , Portuguese , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ an you for your parents in recognition of how to have ende@@ avor@@ ed in your younger years .
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , including : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that one feels , after going on in cold days in the sun . &quot;
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they deci@@ de@@ dly other cultures , reve@@ aling other cr@@ abs and wake up our new gi@@ er@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how to analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy lingu@@ ists on this site even more of this &quot; &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able words &quot; &quot; and show how different , valuable and impressive in these small languages . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is going to deal with the worst floo@@ d@@ disaster of the decade
the South of Sri Lanka is currently looking at the worst high @-@ water and terrestrial disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally comes to the end of May , are due to strong ra@@ inf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; following an opinion of the disaster of Sri Lanka , from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing for the wings and sl@@ amm@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected by Friday ( 26 May ) , and about 100 000 people were brought to a safe place of residence . &quot;
&quot; the ra@@ inf@@ alls were left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas were slowly going back . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population face massive challenge in the affected and still un@@ appro@@ achable areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the floo@@ d@@ disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water intervals of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the high water situation .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lan@@ kas are fatal flu@@ ids making the den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ ster crisis , Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in the flood , water up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the mor@@ p@@ eg@@ els of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the air force has five aircraft available for lif@@ ebo@@ ards , and another five are made ready for transportation of emergency supplies to the residents in their floo@@ ded villages . &quot;
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also prepared themselves to help .
Facebook sites such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue operations Dro@@ h@@ nen require for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
&quot; for all , the dry foods and life @-@ needed goods for high @-@ water he@@ ater - &quot;
we are now in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) ask the Georgian people to share their site data with the help of the app , so that the cataly@@ st centre is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ thouse Ro@@ an@@ u , the Pick@@ Me brought a &quot; &quot; high @-@ water aid &quot; button , which allowed it to call a vehicle to picking up assistance and donations . these were then distributed free to the s@@ lan@@ k@@ ic Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; as well they conducted a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which had more than thousand en@@ qu@@ en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat @-@ saving actions for the flood of flood and land@@ slide people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , inhabitants will bring people in need for safety and aid . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lan@@ kan , the long way to restoring norm@@ ality . &quot;

photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
use approved t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighb@@ or and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she trusted me her children ; she is my rock in the burnt . &quot;
in the one minute we are calling for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next scale we conclude the rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are located in a sea of rain@@ forest and men , some keep the iconic image of a woman with sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ate slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my love looks me and says , &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim , &quot; &quot; I ask myself . &quot;
I already run this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; that has built itself in their conception . &quot;
it ent@@ e@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see everyone straight away .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be Muslim to be different in different ways . but somehow we are all plu@@ gged into the same Muslim dra@@ wer .
&quot; this dra@@ wer is so well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit there , be mus@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
Muslim Br@@ otherhood will be
I stand alone with that alone .
&quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images do you come in mind if you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this Del@@ ete makes a great deal of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims living in this world .
another consists in the redu@@ tion@@ istic images of Muslim men who have been coloni@@ zed by western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting picture is determined by the dark man who should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark of Palestinian @-@ American scientists Edward S@@ aid cancelled the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures can also be seen further today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood ste@@ ward them continued . &quot;
I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ atives domin@@ ate our News@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this fo@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed the reality , which have led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ v fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women will be prevented by carrying their head sc@@ arf in public buildings and sau@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced through their government to cover the whole body that these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; to the &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women , which lead the movements for change . &quot;
it looks like the first Muslim Pra@@ yers were spoken in the American soil of Afri@@ cans who were brought to slave ships .
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination , so deep and faul@@ ty that often Si@@ ei@@ kh men and children become the goal of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and sli@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories , we tell and because of the way we tell , is Islam@@ opho@@ bia not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
1.1 billion belong to the 1.1 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just stories to tell that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations to help us understand the world .
and my industry is f@@ abled to record the nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed to make up seven million Muslims living in the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my rehear@@ sed parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid their first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan thought the sky@@ lines of the world were new , my parents were uns@@ um@@ erable Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ contaminated Muslim ma and Americ@@ anism ?
&quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t say pig meat , I say - rather than my Muslim recipes or to pick up my handmade recipes , all Muslims with themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I jo@@ kes , we do not carry all the T@@ ash@@ y with us . &quot;
&quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security ch@@ equ@@ es at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding mus@@ Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists who endeavour to fight widespread lies over Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing volume of a well @-@ trained by anti @-@ war machine , t@@ ink @-@ tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which is already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stran@@ ger who leaves a woman the head@@ sc@@ arf . &quot;
&quot; or as the sc@@ ary card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below . &quot;
screens@@ hot of the AC@@ ES website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms att@@ aches our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it attacks our identity that is so far @-@ reaching , so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered , that it can impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer . &quot;

I would like to explain .
&quot; I was born as Muslim , but a Muslim was born , when I was four years old , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ an Church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social sciences describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my muscular faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighb@@ or , my neighb@@ or in the Brand@@ ung see that I am Muslim , when they could look through the 15 feet concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the mund@@ ane ritual with my daughter when I kill them in my arms and her Arabian verses to protect against the protection that the Quran and the Q@@ ul@@ s are called . &quot;
every of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my muscular faith is probably not always visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins a I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
&quot; belonging to my grand@@ mother mat@@ ern@@ al with her sisters , she gained a contest of art of fl@@ ashing in Kar@@ achi in decades ago . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her , that I will see in this moment , when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its full@@ filled and un@@ finished painting , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters , that can be almost extinct . &quot;
&quot; Muslims have to be Muslim , which means prayers to speak , which they told me , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Muslims shall be in it as she brought me , to refer to God : Allah Sh@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that was founded over centuries - through a &quot; Empire &quot; colonial , which has established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Komp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning to call my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with their grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my acci@@ weigh@@ ed grandfather wept . &quot;
&quot; middle of America , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ asch@@ mir@@ s , wept N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ um@@ wo@@ unds to his family in India controlled Kash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , who were scattered by coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
Muslims to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans are all coloni@@ zed to four Muslim countries .
&quot; it means to know , that the first plane of the history was rejected by a Muslim country in a century ago . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an anti @-@ Catholic sub@@ ordinate of the British empire , introduced by the newspapers of his time as &apos; dangerous &apos; , as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before it existed before the aircraft , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my mus@@ li@@ lim@@ ic strain of 1.7 billion go deeply into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ ess ; our un@@ bund@@ led story .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops , which were divided over every continent , apart from the Antarc@@ tic , distributed in Iraq to chase weapons of mass destruction that are not existed . &quot;
it means knowing that over half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried among the ruins of the war .
an American Muslim will mean to know that the su@@ pre@@ mor@@ ate has risen in veterinary since 2001 by more than 32 percent .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy comes the USA and bears the susp@@ ect a Muslim name , the story four times will report more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four@@ teen years of the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , called the Az@@ aan , called a detached black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that a hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth , which I feel , when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
it is the hope I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
&quot; to be a Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim ma and a journalist means the in@@ dur@@ ente inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple ties of identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate to others . &quot;
&quot; the Fo@@ rati@@ v of the 1,@@ 7 billion has more possibilities than a mag@@ ician cube , but is represented in the reduced num@@ b &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to make me care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that making powerful and privileged people on this branches of structural hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; structural hos@@ tility exists in the Muslim registr@@ ars , which began with President Bush and expanded to President Obama . &quot;
it is in @-@ to @-@ end monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it exists in the immigration officer , which takes a five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it exists in a country that closes its borders to people from exactly the countries , it bom@@ bed it bom@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; it is a false and neb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly @-@ list , &quot; which largely takes Arabs and Muslims into the sight . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs , which we throw on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and thanks to those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically un@@ true image and b@@ ats them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the sli@@ gh@@ test score .
conf@@ ations that we have to perform
&quot; we have been a deep understanding , a Muslim or the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we stand decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous post@@ prints which we ste@@ aling into our news transactions . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry which tries to grasp our often with binding identi@@ ties and for@@ ce@@ ased history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , S@@ ay Some@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ cle Secret Li@@ ves ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ ly authors and printing , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

Coll@@ age of the author .
&quot; but I am worried , due to this difficult global point of view , where we are in . &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
&quot; there is one reason that conspir@@ ators the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House is leading . &quot;
they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they did Muslims with others .
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by doing the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a couple of years before , it had not yet been given ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am worried about the realities and the story , which I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but that is me today to a troubled Muslim . &quot;
things which I left here like a Br@@ ot@@ u@@ umen@@ ical lane in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter @-@ stories that makes our mankind a story , where someone is going to be a &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations will take place at the 8th annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , these are no concepts with which we usually throw in our schools around us or who we read in our newspapers . &quot;

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell that here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are managed and people established by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public conception , four decades ago science of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we must ask ourselves un@@ com@@ promised questions about the role of which , aware and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; &quot; ; as it did my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the chocolate was bombar@@ ded to us , while he already bombar@@ ded countries and &quot; to other common &quot; people , goes far beyond the invisible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ l@@ kunst wants to preserve more diversity

can there be a possibility to connect here and now despite a language barrier with anyone ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treasure Hill Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the number of stories in their original language . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ translated blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written subject but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get the language variety of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children who born there . &quot;
for the creators of the project :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , which are experiencing diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are , to float . &quot;
&quot; while listening to often is associated with it , &quot; defend these events instead &quot; listening to appreciate , to feel to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers will present their story first in their own language and translate them to English . &quot;
&quot; although the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , so their devotion and its representation is that the audi@@ ences are imp@@ acted . &quot;

Puerto Rico calls for the United States of New Com@@ peti@@ tions
&quot; with the aim of a new test@@ ament in the public debt of Puerto Rico , participating in 72 million US dollars , participated in the city @-@ captain Capit@@ ol , the Government Building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was accessed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( BÃ¼rger@@ Front for the neur@@ examination of debts ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ian church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the c@@ iting of the re@@ vocation of debts also submitted a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people Puerto Ri@@ cos demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies , which are responsible for debts for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for financial examination and a loan committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will be pres@@ pressed and suppres@@ sed .
the people Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not find themselves with sin@@ ful retirement payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not into the territory of the integrated overseas territories of the USA - suff@@ ers from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; is a governing non @-@ profit organization without party membership , with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law for government responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; from the outside , measures will be imposed without participation and conviction of the citizens of danger , rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration had the name &quot; &quot; watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Sy@@ ro @-@ Palestinian web@@ develop@@ er Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il as well known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but it is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and their relatives continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions that he has made for an open net . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s date : publicity , the annual conference on digital culture that will be held in Berlin , dedicated an event to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , busin@@ ess@@ ences at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective re@@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book that has been published last year and is freely available here , contains a number of approaches that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
&quot; this book aims to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge , and what the real cost is , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have side our news fe@@ eds , who surround our news fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free b@@ ass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and ground@@ ed Internet volunteers that has been incar@@ cer@@ ated in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was painted by the O@@ dra @-@ prison directory in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have not received any information about his current state or location . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective re@@ membran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for its release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing as Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us start to think about their own fate , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what have we decided ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time @-@ wise con@@ vic@@ tions ?
the web developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the imprisonment of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to a non @-@ known place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer of N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police b@@ ass@@ el reported on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; of the military court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by people who presented himself as the insi@@ der of Assad government , and took note of an alleged death part against her husband . &quot;
his place of residence and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently sur@@ pass@@ able the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project coordinated by Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of bas@@ tic cultural prot@@ otypes were preced@@ ent than the work that he began with a group of arche@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the way@@ cross of numerous civi@@ lizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began to work with this work , the IS would not just put it into this architecture , which em@@ bo@@ died not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip @-@ suit into the digital ology and conservation has created a time @-@ capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public , as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; typically , b@@ ass@@ el of this project could not yet close . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison . &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life with this , of freedom to dream and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English at even when he was in prison .
&quot; I learned to read and speak English , English good . &quot;
&quot; he always has his knowledge with each shared , who asked . he has taught other incar@@ nations to read and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened me the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet at .
&quot; he also brought other det@@ ain@@ ees as they use computers , at least theoretically , without they actually stopped one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a song cloth , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband , when he was in prison . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked for a year long in the book .
&quot; she ornam@@ ents the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he over@@ put them out of the Arabic Arabic English . &quot;
the book is lic@@ ally available .
book@@ envel@@ ope of Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here &apos;s an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens with every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I fail in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose sight in the moment , in which we embrace the poor , &quot;
that any of the dangers does not matter .
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , we@@ ars and Guardian &quot;
I forget the cr@@ ush of prison
&quot; and I am in every detail of your voice , and words . &quot;
that I wear with passion for me
when your eyes say Le@@ be@@ h
and I am another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I will return quickly to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to reg@@ ain all the moments
and beyond your absence to sore and smile .
I persu@@ ade myself that I will return soon ...

and you are still In the cage of monsters
Bas@@ tion &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in jail . &quot;
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community calls for 2012 the release of Bass@@ el .
today we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption disp@@ ers@@ ed director after discharge from previous post to previous post
Moz@@ ambi@@ que re@@ acted with wrath on a corrupt case in which a ruling member resign@@ ed after half of his sentence to the workplace at the state apparatus - in which the corruption was committed .
&quot; this is about Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and 2010 together with four other def@@ endants ref@@ us@@ sion of 54 million Me@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money un@@ folds from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately demanded his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which was happening on 19 April then also . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General @-@ General Office of the Republic , which led the application , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ b@@ aza , back to his old post , as the firm has no discipline as after his det@@ ention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants of the action are not good . &quot;
&quot; the Center for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , distributed in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the director : &quot;
&quot; represents the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a rel@@ uc@@ tance with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company should also have a discipl@@ ining procedures against the negoti@@ ators .
&quot; however , the company seem to be and promp@@ ted no proper legal action to apply the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que social media , reject this behavior likewise , and considers the case as &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous &quot; : &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and took half of them half .
he could pay pre@@ paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has taken himself to be t@@ amper@@ ed in the company that he can cause damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be paid for his silence .
resistant !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ que and Student of Political Science in Brazil says , the director had no mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he in@@ quired him , I can not believe that someone has rewarded someone in such a way that has already paid the state already . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks the morality and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it has only served by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as hand@@ craft it had become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself , this man has become tired , the pre @-@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ah Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison Sam@@ ah Mach@@ el the Moz@@ ambi@@ que will not only remain in mind for ever as a first independent president , but also as a sharp , lonely and - next to said - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he stimul@@ ated that &quot; a ambitious man is capable of all , even the f@@ ather@@ land for its ambitions , its own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambi@@ valent man changes , my experience shows that it &apos;s not that way . he changes the tactics but he does not change from his ambitions . &quot;
a ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also un@@ covered :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat 10 years and came free .
&quot; and today it sets him the company , in which he in@@ cont@@ amin@@ ates the money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Show ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users at injustice
the Bur@@ m@@ ic word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ ent@@ age .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the renowned Social Network took their po@@ sts out of the net , because they played the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people east indi@@ an origin or in general as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; indi@@ an &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; in @-@ out scripts ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radi@@ al nation@@ alistic movements gave the word an extremely deter@@ gen@@ ous c@@ ann@@ ot@@ ation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word which is used mostly by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on his platform . &quot;
&quot; nowadays , Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ may usually be associated with racism but the word in itself is not automatically called H@@ ass@@ language . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also her@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed the purpose of his use . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with fundamental mean@@ ings which have the same character as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ically as &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; written , which contains the same letters as also other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ ent@@ b@@ se ) , &apos;@@ Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends on spiritual nature whether he knew how to rel@@ ieve his back pain , leaving a word playing . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ically - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that they will reduce H@@ ass@@ language radi@@ cal@@ ised nation@@ alists , but also that Facebook will be analytical , before it dis@@ semin@@ ate all po@@ sts that emerged in suspic@@ ion . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filter@@ ing the word automatically .
automation is not understood what you can write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the words above .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ ent@@ b@@ sen ) .
&quot; the good is that this dir@@ tier nation@@ alists to spread the speech , a pretty good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now , it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ed their nation@@ alism at the moment . &quot;
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all that may spread the speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often becomes a pot and mouse game , whereby the users use social networks simply to begin to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the zen@@ ith to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , as Facebook began to delete his po@@ sts , as he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; is ban@@ ished by social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new Directive on Facebook , I made a post office to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the lyrics , post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook community standards did not meet . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions , or who simply try to show their opinions against the leaders of radical nation@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post he told his opinion about why the extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more on Facebook before the start of the initiative - for example the Bur@@ m@@ ic Internet community to ask for advice :
&quot; Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to decrease racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
such words must c@@ ens@@ ored only even more hate inside the various communities .
&quot; moreover , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have so words such as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; her@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found it out that they made mistakes , they tried not to correct the mis@@ understood Po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only little respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a big turnover , this would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic z@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has provided a lot of sp@@ ill among the users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users talk about Facebook funny and consciously writing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of speech to see whether their po@@ sts are taken from the grid . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , which had no hate speech , but nevertheless removed : &quot;
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ic text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and have an inheritance .
&quot; just to try out whether Facebook is the post office , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screens@@ hot with permission used .
&quot; the post is &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;
screens@@ hot with permission used .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to bro@@ aden their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , H@@ ass@@ language should in social networks maintain the violence in the congreg@@ ations in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s were forced to escape . &quot;
Facebook was used for his failure to cri@@ tici@@ ze over @-@ over people on his bur@@ ry sides under control .
&quot; but instead of identifying the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; , &quot; it could have been better running on context than on a code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Tr@@ ini@@ dad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end of the inf@@ alls
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo of Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament voted unanim@@ ously decided by the Parliament to offer this practice so that the most vulnerable age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; in front of this change of sp@@ ouses there were a few members of hin@@ dered and Muslim denom@@ inations . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , that the state did not inter@@ fere with the state , as that , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened irrespective of the fact that Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN &apos;s rights prevention , the min@@ ors @-@ old as well , for every person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago 2,@@ 8 percent , and with 18 it was 8,@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Statisti@@ cal office of the country was confirmed that since 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online Peti@@ tions and Social @-@ Media movements that stri@@ ves to prevent laws on children , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced strong support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; however , it was not all smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Hin@@ du guide , B. had no concerns about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should not take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition looked for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point , doubts came to whether the opposition would not agree with the legislative acts whatsoever . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of 2017 , the legislative draft was decided against the children &apos;s h@@ ehe - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority could make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the President of the country must agree and declare the law . &quot;
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave us an status update on Facebook which was re@@ posted to Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
&quot; Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the legisl@@ ator against children &apos;s foot was decided in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for , and no one against it . &quot;
&quot; after having been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become the law . &quot;
&quot; the majority of social media users was enthusiastic , because the laws of the children have finally been changed . &quot;
&quot; Facebook @-@ Member Lov@@ ell Francis , the minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary mer@@ ging needed to conc@@ e@@ aled the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s h@@ ehe is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now , and that is almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson the opinion , it was definitely long enough to take care of the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook from Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent news ! &quot;
the sp@@ ouses has been decided .
&quot; minimum @-@ old - 18 , - - 35 for it - 0 on it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group which openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the delicate age in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious sen@@ i@@ ority 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the amendment of the For@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , there are 41 members and 35 members of whom were present in the vote . &quot;
&quot; all MEPs who were against , have voted for the law . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is legally permitted in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ ri@@ ag@@ ei@@ schild .

congratulations .

&quot; however , a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to take into judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and it seems to trigger its promise . &quot;
&quot; during the General &apos;s mandate de Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said , it is quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj wants to go against the law , the most social media users , you would approach the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion in general , in a way that we would be taking place instead of the problem that we may , instead of great , hard @-@ faced men who may be ab@@ used to them , would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s cr@@ ashes in different grad@@ ations , or continue to the norm even though there are laws which they under@@ say . &quot;

&quot; through the mir@@ rors of websites , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia @-@ content again . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was shown on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A Copyright legislation in the US , internationally obsc@@ ured . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month now , Turkey has been part of the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle . &quot;
day after day is more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students as well as re@@ por@@ ter and fans of TV @-@ series w@@ elling themselves against the closure .
&quot; although many techniques used Internet users are used to use tran@@ smit@@ ters for block web sites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest V@@ PN prevalence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been ongoing since 2008 article from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , take place regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the two @-@ known country in the world when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains closed , several Mir@@ ror@@ sites ( pages that reflect the content from Wikipedia and frequently be updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform put all the Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centr@@ alised Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ Network ( i.e. PC calcul@@ ator ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete z@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;
the content is published in spite of legal pro@@ hibition .
in a blo@@ c post IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( on the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything on it , snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help the users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the web site www.@@ cb@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also included that this step is independent of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about Screen@@ shots and no li@@ ve@@ - or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid the sperm . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to ho@@ ang@@ ed from similar mir@@ ror@@ sites when in the respective country is going to emerge . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; there is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mir@@ rors . &quot;
one attacks on another URL that is not the original one . that what you can see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server dire@@ cts the request to the right Wikipedia page so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around himself , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry with poorly positioned moti@@ fs and washed colors . &quot;
the motiv@@ ating yourself to wear a camera with themselves and try to walk the situation .
at that time he was still a kid .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 years , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring up to the international scene . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown right beside the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which draw attention to Nep@@ als wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook where this first class position helps in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; I just felt at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called . he had a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I burned with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had observed it and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was , and I immediately began to squee@@ ze pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not so terrible as they look .
&quot; and he ought to know , for he stood by tigers from face to face ; &quot;
a tiger can not distur@@ b from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleep @-@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was at home due to the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ har@@ dest appeared . he immediately sets out , we see and sat by the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
to promote the protection from wild animals in Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to make in the Bar@@ dia National Park Rec@@ ord@@ ings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days , until he took a tiger photographed and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist destinations . &quot;

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ ona@@ az K@@ aly@@ aly@@ a and originally published on Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , there are women with great care to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pr@@ ad@@ esh give women to respect the husband because of the social pressure to respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should respect the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a and con@@ stru@@ ed by their family and the village community after having raised a mess@@ ed relatives by name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of wives also not to name their wives , is also common among men . however , they are far less common to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including healthcare , and house@@ wives , a unique club , and were thus quickly become the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the reduction of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working with the aid of practices for seven years with the aid of practices , such as children &apos;s homes to connect H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ In@@ fied , and manages these clubs . &quot;
they reported how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and they have made them at the same time to amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion , was of women who did not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she has chosen for this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women can easily identify with .
&quot; the name of their sp@@ ouses is not according to the utter@@ ance , is a Br@@ other who is maintained all of an agreement and never asked questions . &quot;
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him long life .
&quot; a woman , which does not hold this is considered to be depos@@ ited , as a woman without morality . &quot;
&quot; tradition is so deeply rooted in that we have never thought about this discussion , and have never thought about it . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the rough , Roh@@ ini has never had called the name of her husband to try out at home with her husband . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini said :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband ro@@ ds even long after the video was at the end .
&quot; intern@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I would call him from now on with his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage started Roh@@ ini their first discussion club .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pr@@ ad@@ esh . &quot;
&quot; after the vide@@ o@@ projection , the women examined the discussion with an exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , meaning that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day before they brought the name of her sp@@ ouses to the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was out of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women will never be able to speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini said :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise , she decided throughout the exercise ; another decided to step up the whole stri@@ pped frustration against him and his family to cur@@ se him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an ancient fires , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands in the name . &quot;
and they held their word .
Roh@@ ini has received a variety of reports over the next few days .
the husband called a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put the women into the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she joined , she was afraid and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation arose in violence .
&quot; in Roh@@ ini , how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red spot on the forehead , which shows the sp@@ ouses : &quot;
why do women only show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red spot if he also works . &quot;
he laughs only and I listened to him to wear it .
&quot; the other women do not have stopped fully with it , but mean , they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days . &quot;
for many women the debate is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do a trip with every discussion club . &quot;
&quot; usually , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field . &quot;
&quot; I do not want to make the women worry who what could hear , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birthday with cakes ; they danced and s@@ angen and spoke about things that they had never thought about .
Roh@@ ini said :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have talked about some things , for example , such as our identi@@ ties to our sp@@ ouses , have never been as honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things noisy , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and as it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have worn only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most is the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ at @-@ spa , a broad shirt over a p@@ ants , wearing ; they have not drunk . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of arguments and discussion on the mer@@ its of their own clos@@ eness , mor@@ als connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , dress her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that the women could carry it . &quot;
&quot; next they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans , and Roh@@ ini is sure to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months since their first panel has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles : &quot;
we have done only small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then listening to them again to say the name of their spouse . &quot;
&quot; some who included myself , make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two still say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the cra@@ ving for more freedom of movement or their own clos@@ eness - lying in the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that will change something .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes to the club and other people who are talking about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men in the district are killed , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
&quot; one of the victims was de@@ w@@ dered , and a part of the organs have been taken . &quot;
&quot; two men were arrested , and in the episode they admit that the bodies of sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi are being used . &quot;
&quot; it will give the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a gl@@ ary man of gold could bring gold into old or wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia on the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on gl@@ aring men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que were registered .
another group that is the purpose of m@@ ord@@ ances for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 to investigate a mission in the South African country to investigate these practices .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighboring country of Tanzania , where the Government developed campaigns in order to fight this sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;

he warned those who want to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the aim of ritu@@ alistic attacks , the mos@@ ques police brought after the latest decre@@ es of three gl@@ az@@ ing men due to their body parts . &quot;

&quot; Hus@@ ky Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ile in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police have already commented on the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ aman is involved in the death of the gl@@ az@@ ing men .
&quot; persecution and ass@@ ass@@ ination of gl@@ az@@ ing individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ Rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , presum@@ ably the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que into consideration ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief existed according to which the victims might have been in power , the rich@@ es of the brain . &quot;
in recent days three men have been murdered with hair loss issues in this part of the country .
&quot; Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Saman@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ ggers arms Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , which pointed out that the problem is part of the larger social difficulties that Moz@@ ambi@@ que faces : &quot;
&quot; I like to hear E@@ IN Moz@@ ambi@@ que , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH grin@@ ding a country where the teacher would have asham@@ ed to offer sex against good notes , work , and other services , a nation in which the people would consume their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted , which aim to get faster wealth . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the chance for mak@@ ab@@ ren corruption could not be missed . &quot;

the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the det@@ ain@@ ees Chinese Dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer in late June had announced that he had been sent to hospital due to liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( prosec@@ ution ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a Mani@@ fes@@ to which calls for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China wrote the Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and a spokes@@ man says , he did not require it to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to receive views from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or allow it a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely exposed to the topic . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a narr@@ ator had to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad a treatment . &quot;
Norway Norway Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Liko release .
&quot; the relation between China and Norway was gr@@ ated to Li@@ u after the Nobel Peace Prize was launched in 2010 , although the Norwegian government were able to have nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; the diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon tour to China since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked . &quot;
&quot; after reading the message had spread that Li@@ u has seriously fallen ill with Li@@ u , the Nobel Committee brought up his hope for a unconditional release of expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; because of his arrest , he was unable to withdraw his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision in which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the leading position of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China for the release of Li@@ us , as she said in an explanation on 30 June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they shall meet all the visits and receive those who wish , and be able to communicate free with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans , &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , inas@@ much as he may help with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary and Poll@@ ey , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the Embassy of the Chinese authorities call not only Li@@ u not only Li@@ u not to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of US Embassy moved out an angry answer from China to themselves , with the declaration of foreign affairs that &quot; &quot; no country have the right to interven@@ ing and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
poll@@ en shared with that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice , which they have the right to Chinese Constitution and legal systems , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ kl@@ ey and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to supp@@ ress the Chinese government to supp@@ ress Li@@ u and his wife uncondi@@ tionally . &quot;
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o uncondi@@ tionally so that he can move into a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; the German government agency Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u has given all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution to Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was released on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agentur Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could pass the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
on 28 June the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China urged to provide adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to provide yourself with his family .
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police have always super@@ vised the room in the hospital and that it is Li@@ u not permitted to contact anyone outside , including his lawyers , speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells more :
&quot; Canada is calling on China to protect his international human rights , including free expression of expression , and free of freedom for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry asked to release China in an explanation on 29 June to Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he needs , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family can have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news sender France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Foreign Ministry announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately be absor@@ bing him . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the Tre@@ aties in Taiwan called on 27 June to the Li@@ u , and to demonstrate a greater tolerance to those who want to use peaceful resources to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ w@@ anese legisl@@ ator , Yu @-@ i @-@ nu from the governing Democratic Party party also called for China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to treat yourself in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very concerned in an explanation on 28 June at Li@@ u and asked that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and for which he was severely repres@@ sed , in a harmon@@ ious , stable and wealthy China , which would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt very moved personally and also encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly because Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , Singapore was regarded as a city . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the International Association of the Bar Association of New York , the minister of New York noted that many people were cri@@ tici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because Singapore compared with other countries . &quot;
he support Singapore as a city should be considered .
nobody has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is it , whereby most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a town .
we are not a land .
&quot; the Blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; rot@@ ate the logic to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable land , we hear that we don &apos;t want to be a land . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the form of escape from the responsibilities , a compul@@ sory . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one can &apos;t measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal lands &apos; , given that , it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he def@@ ends that Singapore with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old body of the author@@ itarian rulers appear to be democr@@ at , leave the twi@@ sted logic , as they fit better into their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end of the last week of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , answers to his American guests were given to our press , our Ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ap@@ ed with non @-@ answers ration@@ ally .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am to make his opinion clear because it did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to sw@@ allow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to what country is our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clear this point , unless he was paid to be part of the Government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by reading An@@ on on the blog , he pointed out the cri@@ tiques to read the full signature of the conference so that in order to understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , in which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the signature .
&quot; as he said , Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; he said why the elections in Singapore was so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
in Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party of decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore was not a land , &quot; he obviously does not meant to be meant in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am who is as leaders of a her@@ growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , I am very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected - do I do with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he is defending and aware of what he defended . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review submitted the sever@@ ity of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ um@@ ers :
did Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; well@@ ed a mistake &quot; or was it a freel@@ ancer ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role within the administration , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am are of grave significance . &quot;
&quot; why do the clubs and their military service do they defend their military service , but they do not defend their country but not their land ? &quot;
whom does our Prime Minister invo@@ ices pay ?
what is the value of our pink recruitment ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade for Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always was a city : &quot;
&quot; I did not say , what I said ... &quot;
this phrase seems to have anno@@ yed a lot of the Lon@@ gi@@ ans ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we always have a city .
we always were a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; defending the country especially &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; but this is not quite true . &quot;
we should speak more of the defence of the city rather than the defense of the city .
the myth of &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
screens@@ hot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your home or home country ?
your answers will be shown here as part of a continued series with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question which is placed in Japan most is : &quot; &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , I will reply . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I go back and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation in which situation the conversation takes place , it is regarded as courteous , interested in his conversation , by providing personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then the default response then usually follows the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans bo@@ il perhaps in@@ war@@ dly especially anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t distur@@ b this . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know him , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian Flag well visible in their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; it was so , when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , in front of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le sheets at their luggage to differentiate yourself from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
we have no weapons !
equal mar@@ riages in Canada have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are courteous .
&quot; we apparently say very often &quot; &quot; ap@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be considered the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like this guy south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I admired . &quot;
I would say nothing if you would change Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp . &quot;
&quot; first : to be called &quot; nice , &quot; means basically to be sp@@ ire - as the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has one own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing , where you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; harmless , means un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good if you want un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around it . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders described as &apos; nice &apos; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans not often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au then the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &apos; nice .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band released a music video released the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and in spite of its promises to restore the civil government , continue to uph@@ old the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band tat@@ too Col@@ our describes a young man who tells , what rules makes him his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was an amazing success .
only within the first three days that was divided on Facebook high up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 li@@ kes .
&quot; last month , even the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ video &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists invited the public to look at this video . &quot;
&quot; the video is possible to interpret as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies , in@@ particular how it beh@@ aves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
take a look at these recordings of the video which have per@@ si@@ sted on some of the political issues that have per@@ si@@ sted in Thailand over the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; might refer to the dra@@ in Section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which provides absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; setup modification &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons appearing off the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and clear rules often be used by the authorities to minimize the activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , monitors the online content and individuals , those pre @-@ thrown , the monarchy is prosec@@ uted , criminal prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand is set up a strike against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( majest@@ y ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that jun@@ ta continues to buy the Jun@@ ta is their decision to buy expensive U boats , although safety experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black product , before they can enter into an inter@@ viewer , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they said &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and internet users will face long arrest , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band showed the Sal@@ ut out of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch @-@ oppos@@ ers during the protests 2014 . &quot;
life goes on in the ruins of the gh@@ o@@ cities in the eastern Ab@@ il@@ asia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war company , only recovered very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has been over 20 years since the Georgian war has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still heavily visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbohydrates of Asia Minor . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , f@@ antasi@@ es , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on sovi@@ ets in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the biggest part of the Russians and the ch@@ ases are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also known in Ab@@ il@@ es as well as vul@@ ture cities .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here today , there are only a few hundred people in these ho@@ stages . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for t@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district of 16.@@ 000 people had hardly risen about a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ kov@@ ka , stand symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling apart and rarely they are occupied by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it is hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were common centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of the fel@@ lowship . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable splend@@ or buildings .
&quot; the people , who once lived in this place and had their contributions to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot;
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha lives approximately fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chev had one or two families , one sees the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they will pull off immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother is forbidden to let us photograph , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she is simply forbidden , that is all . &quot;
the girl fle@@ eing her girlfriend something to and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence sector ( growing agricultural products for their own needs ) such as animal farming , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the l@@ aps .
the District administration provides for free candles and bread on the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ chini &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly lady named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ alya as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left the f@@ antasi@@ es to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Asia , &quot; she tells her . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she is instead assisted her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly r@@ aments have just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive . &quot;
&quot; a@@ unt G@@ alya tells you , that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and holidays together . &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are we visit us .
but we cannot do this continuously - everyone is busy with their own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighb@@ or appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , calling T@@ ante G@@ alya her to her . &quot; she said , we could build Zu@@ c@@ chini . &quot;
I have prepared the ground already .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ chini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
&quot; G@@ aly@@ as conversation , Nat@@ asch@@ a has lived together with her husband and five common children in their house for some time . &quot;
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when war began .
every day she reminds of the thor@@ ns before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives , which live in central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia collap@@ sed off ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative det@@ a@@ aup@@ t@@ stadt in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will still take a little . &quot;
Nat@@ asch@@ a receives approximately $ 9 children for each child .
her husband works in the fo@@ al run .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; in the vicinity of the house , where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten once was found , they hold pigs , cows , man@@ e and chickens . &quot;
&quot; it tells you that it was first a very sc@@ ary situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot;
but over time she lost her g@@ inity .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; indeed , it has rather to do something with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was little work and everyone lived as it was right .
I remember every day as the city and the war were once .
&quot; as our conversation at the end , a little boy is passing by us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy hun@@ ted him back .
he plays with the ball that goes up the hill .
a group children now follow the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw some of them stones to the dec@@ ayed buildings . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood that care for ignorance in their lives .
you do not know it different .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants &quot; migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez introduces a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 at the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; cross the way of migrants , across Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ula , he is at the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - j@@ old Mexican , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink gl@@ ll@@ es and gol@@ d@@ colored ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy bears @-@ shape . &quot;
&quot; she is called Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , and was born in tap@@ ach@@ ula . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama . &quot;
&quot; this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , who are on the transit . &quot;
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for approximately 2,50 Dollar per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with high @-@ cr@@ um@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the pres@@ room there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and ha@@ i@@ ti@@ cian migrants are coming here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , people get in full swing and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call &quot; m@@ um Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received more than 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some also have slept on cardboard . &quot;
I do not want to decline anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them drugs which they cannot pay , they mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ sam , the long journey exhausted . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time . &quot;
I asked him whether M@@ um Africa is a appropriate nickname for Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; reply with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits in it , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to get there her husband and the three children .
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track &quot; , &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans often travel the route and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
as many of his companions have lived Michel@@ et before in Brazil and worked as builders on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship .
&quot; as the Brazilian economy , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money , to buy the bu@@ cket to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I ask him whether he will contact Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Afrika is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he sm@@ iles . &quot; we will always keep in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells that their guests often send text messages when they left to gra@@ ze them or to report on the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith in the drive of her work is .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps well known here but she is not the only hope for migrants that travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the town a cu@@ l @-@ de @-@ sac leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter is Valencia and his family are taken in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found the B@@ usti@@ ckets to be sold to numerous African migrants to be expensive .
&quot; he has started to help them get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar per night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment are 25 people there , mainly Hai@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blank@@ ets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests make through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was reported after a raid on his work place in the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants that travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , and other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he who fled to people with his wife and three children who wanted to shine with him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he was asked about an accommodation and a unknown , a single @-@ educ@@ ative , has offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family lives still there and they try to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back to the house of Mama Afrika is all full of guests .
the passengers also consult their phones to their phones .
&quot; today , a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , much of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also no@@ stal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud mother mar@@ sh she pet@@ ered in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair loss , who made her a Kun@@ ch , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and the elderly . &quot;
she laughs while she is presenting her shortly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; &quot; they have already been gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants will be forced to install on their mobil@@ es a surveillance app .
an Check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter @-@ Users
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities in the west of China , are comp@@ elled to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July the mobile users at the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the City of Ur@@ um@@ qi have received a mobile notification , in which it points the District government called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the communication statement , the app is to obtain access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities use the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app , breaking news with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police force that the app would identify the sources and distribution ways of terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs Web site describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ us@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ ing porn graphi@@ cally websites , from online fraud , Tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sides to alert users how much time they spend online , and to use their own home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these features can naturally be used in many ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers could capable of manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al from it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to take control of the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports about digital z@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dism@@ al for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme assur@@ ances and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ ous Internet mining . &quot;
&quot; the based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; ni@@ fied &quot; &quot; ) , the ens@@ ored news in China published , showed photos of a check@@ point where the polic@@ emen were in@@ discrimin@@ ated by the polic@@ emen , whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with no one device without these software they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is an set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; you have comp@@ elled the people to use devices , which are intended for older people to use . &quot;
this is a form of cap@@ tivity through the rest of the rest technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( no &quot; &quot; ni@@ fied &quot; , &quot; ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ product description , from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and therefore obtaining un@@ restricted access to the computer hard drive of the computer . &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computer and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang on electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are potentially a reaction to the instructions of the city of Party to minimize the spread of illegal contents .
&quot; all government offices , authorities and related institutions including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office when running their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; an up @-@ to @-@ date report by Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi . a regulation with the statement to all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1st August their &quot; personal ID @-@ cards , hand@@ ys , external drives , portable HDDs , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; to register with the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; and destroy these action , however , the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole host of other possible delays , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything charges according to death &quot;
an individual @-@ cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describe his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you looked at yourself and you decide that you are all alone in one place where all important is gone . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually released and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes their name all glory .
one that has de@@ pressed in a list of feelings and phrases that do not allow a met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but if the reality takes you again and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and everything moves after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts solve themselves in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth are caught on the axis of salvation . you &apos;ll realize that you are tr@@ apped here among the walls , which your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone by stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but I didn &apos;t believe that I am form@@ ulating my lesson - as the chief of the security officer it form@@ ulating - with the promise that the fourth time a pleasure would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by saying even the simpl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn down during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was made , that the city ref@@ ra@@ ined the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all city districts , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a town that came up into the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ comp@@ lice . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply in the district heard . &quot;
&quot; I broke the still@@ ness , by crying out several times &quot; &quot; ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; of my house . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence against hate .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , genuine friends joined to me ; we made us a great image that filled my expectations full . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you are fre@@ ed the Spirit out of the lamp , but they are simply not interested in doing . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot;
he laid on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can sw@@ allow yourself - nothing can give you your voice , after you put it all the way up to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ assan stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ assan begins to speak : &quot; let me listen to as you &apos;re &apos;@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes moved on me .
&quot; and you really eat what , to look in my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of that building . &quot;
&quot; maybe it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity , maybe at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure to me , when I said , &quot; I did not think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I never stopped to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have had such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; therefore it is in sol@@ itary , and his father equal to it . &quot;
&quot; his father equal to this . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this con@@ flu@@ ent proposition is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; he was exposed to a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ al@@ ous torture that I have been exposed to months . &quot;
I scre@@ am the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
&quot; then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a hallway to the individual cells . &quot;
I have prepared all the details exactly before I super@@ vise the room .
&quot; other than usual , they have probably dealt with a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one single det@@ ain@@ ees , and must immediately sit down , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I hold back on an old @-@ proven communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; first p@@ anc@@ t@@ ling . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he rep@@ lied to me ultimately .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a rep@@ utable man middle aged , who sees me like and &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness there can be no mark@@ ings , and doctors are not here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers are connected to its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
maybe he will immediately hear .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would not release it if I stay . &quot;
li@@ ars .
I &apos;d like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all of these cranes that lab@@ elled to the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has to be about 10 am in the evening ; always about this time that crying , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the color of the ruin , until I saw the yellow light , that gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; Donn@@ er &quot; , &quot; play@@ back on 13 . S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
&quot; they are here , to be heard . &quot;
&quot; thus , the secret was lab@@ eled : to protect the state security before us and prevent the betra@@ ying and terrorists in us , they speak their denom@@ in@@ ational source map , and therefore en@@ rolled the narrow eye field of their global view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which here is not a land ; it is a cur@@ se to call it co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their cl@@ ans into one hero . &quot;
&quot; I super@@ vise the audi@@ ble and tre@@ ad to Abu I@@ mad , a slim and stupid man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions , who are gli@@ ding him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important things with your life as you tap this conference and to protest on demonstrations , which anyway will end up an end . &quot;
I rep@@ lied .
I have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to my acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to not answer .
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ati@@ als and blo@@ ws have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication means .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used embarrass@@ ed , pun@@ ished , even though I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he is called the affection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fes@@ sion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that stems from the l@@ ump .
your exec@@ ution@@ er is rejo@@ iced in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot hold your crying . &quot;
&quot; my write was not yet enough , so why they were re@@ distribut@@ ing the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a g@@ arbage collection , or if that belonged to normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined each other , to present ourselves from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ate three of them while I was still in line .
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , so I listened to crying . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling and found no vessel at all because it &apos;s considered to be one of an electric up@@ set .
flow through my whole body enough to supply my entire district .
&quot; my half @-@ nude body , who lay down on the ground was the perfect electricity leader . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night . &quot;
it has to be so at midnight .
I decided to lay down myself again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which occurred to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to dawn .
&quot; the door opens and the light filled the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of an exhaus@@ tive young : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must worry horrible . &quot;
&quot; be silent and be@@ weg you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Rap@@ ord@@ an Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the most of his time inside , sometimes sl@@ ender to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine lips .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which had been part of them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family were forced to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is an im@@ passion@@ ed activ@@ ist who raises the conservative majority and asks their old proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality , and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , who often deal with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but also calls for the core of the whole Arab world . all these issues do not only find in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance but also in cities that reach from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind , and he can feel according to his own statement by men who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he is not open to the US , he swe@@ pt a particular slope against the American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b views his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe its sympathy for those who try to do in war @-@ areas , anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian @-@ fle@@ eting of the second generation , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think because of my own life circumstances , says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think that , because I am a human , &quot; while he sho@@ ok down in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the J@@ ord@@ anian law also means that public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has to do hot with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the s@@ ut@@ ch lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the weak@@ est of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose is first and foremost of freedom . &quot;
&quot; today , Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially if you have a look into the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water - in order to land not in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan has told a appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the j@@ ord@@ al branch of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Fron@@ ts@@ ar@@ tery is contrary to the cultural and traditional standards of the country and be the main reason for the concert hall .
the MP and former spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the sc@@ ary .
&quot; many pret@@ end that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activ@@ ism that arises the old proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; are committed to campaign@@ ing for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement might not simply be the rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but indeed a more evident reality in Jordan reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex @-@ men to lend a body by formed his vision of the destiny of Arab women who have pre@@ fabri@@ cation sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an evi@@ dently un@@ familiar woman , whose arms and legs stretch themselves up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who they actually should trust .
in Jordan the number of &apos; Hon@@ mor@@ ale &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside of the city .
&quot; human Rights Watch recognized that the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , the institutional infrastructure still lacks to support the women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence , in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to in@@ tra @-@ family violence , &quot; and for their release is often a long @-@ called bureaucr@@ atic effort , and the guarantee on the part of the family is necessary that the woman will have nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known , also not to return to subjects that have lived in his country long as tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b bes@@ ts that his work is political , but that he is his music , the full explicit ass@@ ination to sexuality , freedom and expression , not from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Man . &quot;
&quot; I became policy . &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ y@@ al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs which are in the core political , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the songs H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , heter@@ os@@ o- or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on gender equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily ens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to see later his comments from the context had been demol@@ ished and his opinion had been c@@ ens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but he was only an edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b acqu@@ ires H@@ d@@ ai@@ b open for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als did not meet Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what , who later should work on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the eighth century openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ i do not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the ha@@ zel@@ ian Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ anian message mer@@ ged several former government @-@ members and members of the teacher association , with the reason@@ ing , they had expressed critical about the problems in social media with deep deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of what is the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , according to the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan River . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan hat Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row a performance , but the way of progress - this is how H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ ding and internal changes . it is certain that these changes are taking place from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ anic society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , as millions of other Arabs also dreams , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreams not only to bring his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is going through music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , stre@@ um@@ uni@@ tions and on artificial species through guided democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is time , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and also res@@ ist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ oll are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; you susp@@ ect that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of to@@ be@@ ech . another theory out@@ lay down the drums , the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years away from the west to force the Indi@@ gen@@ ous inhabitants of the region to force the em@@ mis@@ hi into the knee . &quot;
we are at the Fo@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to sn@@ ap a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
it is difficult to imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a communal centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally &quot; &quot; ver@@ bi@@ l &quot; ) . &quot;
I looked at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
&quot; still , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival make the only true way to spend its summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sum@@ mer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fe@@ ather was incredible .

a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and therefore also the extrac@@ ted hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers to form the elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , even has an annual event inspired , the competition &quot; &quot; Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os &quot; , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts against each other to show who can create the ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook @-@ profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sers and instead of poor advice a training in the hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the following possibilities have dozens of young people seen that they can take a job which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year in March and reported about some of their achievements :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only professional school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because from love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love @-@ cra@@ ving to guer@@ ri@@ lla

use with friendly permission .
&quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution of &quot; &quot; love @-@ ships to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ im &quot; , &quot; published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
this entry will be published in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love @-@ cra@@ ving to people that we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who have engra@@ ved , affection to them ? &quot;
&quot; this question was about the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Young @-@ Youth activists from the Young Youth Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ ci@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people to write to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare . &quot;
first Sh@@ em was their land swing of an historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ab@@ ew@@ ter F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces Columbus ) which forms the closing point of the longest conflict in Latin America .
&quot; international was devoted to the signing of the peace contract as so significant , that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; however , before the Colom@@ bian , there is a long way to speak from a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to a military rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and they had to integrate their arms around the clock , and have to integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had become acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear of fear and in some cases , it has to record them into their ranks and support them when building up a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans would have to join and help the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love @-@ ships on former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter to welcome them back in society .
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter , which should be transferred personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which was held in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . there were Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the possibility to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day of the love @-@ cra@@ ving , but those forget that they need much needed . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he told to share his love with people this year , which were most urgent . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was created , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC who now must find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities Columbus such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I had never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN @-@ camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o region .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation in the camp to over@@ take the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of F@@ ARC stood up , as they did previously , to assume the commands of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters full of sub @-@ protecting people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different emotions you can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between , &quot; said the political knowledge @-@ student Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca drive this unforgettable experience so : &quot;
&quot; after we passed the letters , a former fighter caused me by the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa @-@ fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw into one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a type of cottage , in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter live ) , I saw an guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter , who wrote a little . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid of responding , because beside him on bed lay a M@@ GL gar@@ at@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the thorn @-@ silk . &quot;
&quot; I said him nevertheless and asked , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; I answered , &quot; &quot; I answered my letter I have written . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life , someone has written me something so beautiful , therefore I quickly responded to it . I suddenly got the tears of the che@@ eks . &quot;
I im@@ pover@@ ished him quite quickly and sat down beside the Gran@@ at@@ cher .
&quot; maybe he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . he had never thought of staying in F@@ ARC , was the only way to save him and his six brothers in front of hunger . &quot; I would have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society that is waiting with open arms to us .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to start @-@ up , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion panel . &quot;
the students had grown up all grown up as war and the F@@ ARC already acted in the dark .
&quot; therefore the leaders of F@@ ARC expl@@ ores the history of the organization , its ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced how the social injustice by the State on the whole Colom@@ bian people have experienced . now , where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party , we can help create society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for the purpose of this size order it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who had never found hearing , and they had no choice , and to realize that people often seen as monsters and even hate even people with beautiful feelings , which were revers@@ ed by their livel@@ i@@ hoods and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does me sore . &quot;
&quot; but it com@@ for@@ ted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage can give us something , and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the Commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the colum@@ bi@@ ans was published that after the draft peace was reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it gives inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to raise the weapons and prot@@ ru@@ ding their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we are putting on the F@@ ARC now to peace , to a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call on all defen@@ ders of peace regardless of which race , religion or ideology - to raise themselves about all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as basis of existence , will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;
a Trans@@ wife talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the Life in front of Kad@@ y@@ row

&quot; it follows the translation of an article , which was written by uns@@ rem Partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa and its first release in the OC Media website . &quot;
&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
with horror activists the reporting of recent months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends on how a D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ worth over the dor@@ m LGB@@ T@@ Q community depends not only overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us what is happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international headlines , after reports have been published , which discussed the wear , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic of the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was released by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Ch@@ echn@@ yan authorities , the suspected que@@ er men , and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina : a trans@@ woman was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there .
&quot; since her childhood , she felt she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was awakening , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya had experienced hor@@ semen of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened up to Sabrina . &quot;
it was fear of fear for her life in the USA .
Sabrina : I was working as an hon@@ orary hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone took my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ woman that arose in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , he did a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he w@@ ick@@ ed them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there &apos;s no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can solve this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the round of W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just there , a few shopping centers were brought forth from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned myself , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time on my ch@@ et : &quot; how long do you still want the family to f@@ ab , you Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , no thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and awak@@ ened last end in the hospital again .
apparently some women had gotten everything and started to cry .
the man was flo@@ wn .
the women had called a hospital .
in the hospital I learned that I had two key@@ rings in my right lung .
OC Media : in which hospitals were you laid - in which men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ on : but the doctor promised and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time on his brush for the first time , I got to do it with fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ mix@@ er , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful for him that he is respectful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got dr@@ ones .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was attended by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded me to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they created absurd calls : some said to me , I must prove it by rel@@ ying on top without the streets , and say that I had not changed my sex in Gro@@ sn@@ y , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have pic@@ t@@ ch size C - what could I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people once spoke my mother on the streets .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only destroyed your family , but the whole of the Republic . &quot;
&quot; we can not sti@@ r you , because you are a dev@@ out wife , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she lay down a strike to the neck . &quot;
fortunately they came to neighbours and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to a flat and a few hours later I found a car with dar@@ ken@@ ed windows and a number plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was a little lazy . &quot;
my man@@ o@@ gi@@ ler friends audi@@ ted the numer@@ ical signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you have fled ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for safety reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then it happened somewhat un@@ credi@@ ble . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without register without my ID , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast it in the g@@ arbage .
arrived and chec@@ s into the hotel .
the number was registered in a stran@@ ger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you are warming in security , just because you left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , to which hotel you st@@ eck@@ st . you even know your room number . &quot;
just to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
that was actually my room@@ number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : just with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the sex even , this is a sp@@ readsheet theme . &quot;
some traditional k@@ au@@ kas@@ y elements I still carry in myself .
&quot; therefore , I also wish it to overcome these spiritual barrier I can not overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me trouble like the person who reminds them out of their past - thus to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have remained intact ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has put up one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he closed a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; so that I mean , they probably invite the relative to those who take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood com@@ missions . &quot;
OC Media : are still going for men in this sec@@ recy ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says it was just not very many .
&quot; if , then especially those who have not left a rich relative or were dropped by their relatives , to face Kad@@ y@@ rows judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there so that they can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should it be brought , you will show off their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked some village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , but specifically sub@@ mer@@ ged to radi@@ ate yourself . &quot;
OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation or have you a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just liked someone who was det@@ ained one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after their beard has grown . &quot;
there have been nothing new since then .
they just taken them with them .
&quot; and this so called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , and there were no reports so far . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
&quot; why otherwise , one could not have allowed these people to shave ? &quot;
&quot; know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always took my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe that before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ sn@@ y than I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
to the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , then it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us back to &quot; &quot; civil society &quot; , &quot; but ultimately caused us to be dis@@ car@@ ded into the stone age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ row have been exhausted ; I had colored eyelashes , tu@@ be@@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops . &quot;
the safety of the sh@@ aria never war@@ ped to me even just one hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ sn@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people as I met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been instruc@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is called &quot; Sp@@ otte not over the mis@@ fortune of another .
they often say to children if those are funny over the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
they never denied me never failed and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ ad@@ ens@@ age thought ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister , he began to speak on mor@@ als on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily on the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could sense how the people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; who had ch@@ ained and s@@ laugh@@ ed , looked at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could sense how the situation in the Republic has been rising steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I earned not much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US not much .
&quot; that apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of Psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ up , arri@@ vals , I accompanying them to the hospital and help them to get food types . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for this .
I discovered these people myself as I dismis@@ s hiding places .
I am Muslim ma and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you bear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is a drivers .
&quot; thus , nature , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no swelling at them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which , the cables have which , the Russians have also what ; on the entire planet it gives them - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I am coming from there , that is why it is unpleasant for me to hear . &quot;
I come here as many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; know many thinking about Transi@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ thful . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation in order to be precise , different way of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not asham@@ ed for my body .
&quot; not , whether I have a partner or not . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I will be here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now last longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab @-@ Nazi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an unusual high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the past months , there has been a strong increase in self @-@ murder . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he was suffering from anxiety , depression , and he asham@@ ed for his own helpl@@ essness that may arise in@@ capacity for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups , who want to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; a on YouTube shared video kept the moments , after he himself fired himself firmly . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to clear the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ ic@@ ide that has existed in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and campaign@@ ing before the spot that more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im - hang@@ s . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : it were all family v@@ Ã¤@@ ters who felt based on persecution by the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and un@@ fit to feed their families and manage a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large part of Iran living in Iran living in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to deny it to the native Arab population . &quot;
&quot; in a century the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly aut@@ on@@ ome region in Iran , until the P@@ oll@@ avi Mon@@ archy took over power over and 1925 great efforts , to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most en@@ viable and most valuable land for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to grow slowly , and the local population gets only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and relaxation . &quot;
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arabs systematically work@@ places in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of com@@ bs , the waters from the Arab areas into the Persian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located . &quot;
&quot; these dem@@ ams have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation in the region caused by drying , and the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm @-@ palms industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi @-@ youths now rose to 81 % .
&quot; Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Ko@@ operative , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is that ended up a job , finished school school , 55 % a further school finished and 45 % of university degrees . &quot;
systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance .
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethno@@ graphic discrimination &quot; , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder under the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly unemployment has become more recently . reason for this , a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z newly developed ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot;
&quot; since functional and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will depri@@ ved the access to work possibilities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and to force them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods outside their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who need to change their first@@ - and surname , to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi , and thus to be questioned because even Arab names in the workplace will not be toler@@ ated , as even Arab names in the workplace will not be toler@@ ated , as speaking of the Arabic language or the carrying arab@@ ic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances , the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must end@@ ure , propose human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is wak@@ ing up and taking note of it .

the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally posted on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was subject of several discussions where many different positions have been expressed .
they can be read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , acting many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even thought quite well thinking scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for instance , in spite of the same education , women still deserve less money than men . &quot;
that women still stand under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women meet sooner or later in various fields of life to a gl@@ amor@@ ous ceiling , and that discrimination is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced that and I am less than twice and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet , if I come to speak on skin color , on racism , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ T community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I talk , how we have always been mentioned under seg@@ reg@@ ation and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , make a lot of white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; however , all women agree that women - all women should come together to sing &quot; their voices and &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , &quot; my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , an institution@@ alized violence there is an institution@@ alized violence that we are exposed to black women in two times . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin areas earn less than white men and women .
that black girl and girls are referred to school with a migration background to the school as a white girl because of the obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women are exposed to a higher risk of women with an immig@@ rant background , or that women are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership , as a white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want to have all women , all the men and all men who have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot consider myself as a black woman , in their center the white woman , who refuse to consider inj@@ us@@ tices in their thinking , which refers both to the gender and to the skin colour of a person . &quot;
&quot; I have exhausted , and I will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ fem@@ ini@@ alist @-@ oriented sp@@ amm@@ ers who repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner said in 18@@ 51 in their speech , &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and even I refused to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized nature . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b through cultural ex@@ propri@@ ation of our customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to put white women the importance of burning skin colour and gender . because some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to in@@ struct them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alist femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women from different origins and ab@@ ort yourself from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of getting rid of the femin@@ ism and close me of the femin@@ ism , which was brought to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m which is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it &apos;s more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and embar@@ king us into the spheres , which will be created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ em , who we can defend ourselves ( approximately : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , in which we can defend ourselves in this way , where they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be admired , which make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al femin@@ ists are immediately retri@@ eval separ@@ atism and exclusion , after they read these lines , ask about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can distinguish black women and women of other cultures , as there existed in this paradig@@ m . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will be acknowledged because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman as part of this paradig@@ m . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither over@@ looked , nor ignored . &quot;
pad@@ do@@ cking against contamination : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ ke was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine dedicated to international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
as part of a Content @-@ sharing agreement this article will be re@@ published here again .
&quot; repeatedly , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern by Kur@@ distan in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who declared to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a kid , &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country are concerned that the decades of war , the construction of D@@ ams , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - an affiliate of Water@@ man Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a sums up the ur@@ gency and the importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more how would we survive then ?
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq resident documentary fil@@ mer@@ in and multi@@ medi@@ al journ@@ alism , filmed and published . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies in followed , little remarkable sub@@ cultures and new multi @-@ media techniques , with their help of suppres@@ sed communities who can tell their stories in their way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; to express their pain through the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show off their rejection . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # soft @-@ Semi@@ conductors ) that reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been modified to protect people affected .
&quot; a police com@@ miss@@ ary said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner , which she had become violent against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship had been a little time passed and the police said , her statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for mi@@ tigation , also useful the active display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved their ad .
breaking up the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women are reported at all once , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also dependent on the men who mis@@ use them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 Ex@@ trac@@ ts and Statisti@@ c 2 Inv@@ isible Mis@@ sions and a judicial system , which has nothing under ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , defic@@ i@@ ent conversion of stro@@ kes and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mis@@ understood , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , research for gen@@ der@@ wonder at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various references and reports , but not even ans@@ at@@ zwei@@ se the extent of the gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures currently available are alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , at the District Office @-@ Office 9@@ 600 ads were part of domestic violence . at 70 % of this , it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the adver@@ ts with the police came from women .
there were over 5000 advertisements because of domestic violence in peace . also here came 86 % of the adver@@ ts of women .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said that they have been physically fighting , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister , Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di will actually appear only a few of these crimes . &quot; to any woman who will be re@@ funded in Paraguay for psych@@ ic mis@@ sive display , 9 women who do not do so . &quot;
&quot; every woman , which is re@@ funded because of physical abuse , two women will not do , &quot; &quot; declared it at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s ic@@ ide in Paraguay have no own prosec@@ utor , the prosec@@ ution bodies cannot be adequately documented , how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
alone until August 2016 journalists had at least 12 cases of women &apos;s genocide in the country .
coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates dies in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies on account of violence through men .

invisible distr@@ acts and a judicial system that is nothing lower
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , insi@@ sted that she called his name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she did not want it , but then she did . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she carried the psych@@ ic force of my part , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time , recognis@@ able : &quot;
I have never thought that I would have been the victim of failure .
&quot; when I read earlier this , I always thought that that only women happens to be sub@@ servi@@ ent because it is dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name names , she wrote posts on Facebook where they described his le@@ ases and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she liked it so long by Carlos and left him no earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse at least had some compli@@ city to blame .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was suspic@@ ious . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ tori@@ as case everything started with mental abuse .
&quot; their wealthy partners made it finally , to convince them that they worth@@ less . &quot;
then he started to beat her .
&quot; Vic@@ tori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a trial against its former partner who developed into an in@@ scr@@ utable legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly for money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach to poor implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but it is not used . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
on 10 August 2016 the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament was deb@@ ated by the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # FÃ¼r@@ th ) .
this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ in@@ ear ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original design of the law looks ahead to explain Fem@@ ale to an independent criminal record and to pun@@ ish offen@@ ders as it is in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; the leg@@ is@@ text was altered in some points in order to also win the MEPs for the law who feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are currently banned in Paraguay , and be pun@@ ished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was envis@@ aged to bear the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which have to bear the victims of violence at present , if they just want to display it and want a safe accommodation to leave the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors do not provide adequate financial resources for this purpose :
in Paraguay war abuse is seen as part of inter@@ human relationships .
&quot; here , a change of mind must take place , so that violence will no longer be considered anything of Nor@@ mal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the light of these facts , makes him guilty and contributes to the offen@@ ders . &quot;
we have to report as long notification until Mis@@ si@@ can no longer apply as normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 the law in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate was adopted . prior to that , parts of the law has been changed , which among other things have been a passage in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity to aggres@@ sor his victims again .
&quot; the string of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man a year after the pro@@ hibition of a newspaper continued to attack attacks
&quot; this website has been blocked because of a decision of the information officer , on the homepage of the &quot; &quot; botanical newspaper Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting about corruption in the Sultan .
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he resign@@ ed a year @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later they were again free . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after having put his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state of state . &quot;
&quot; since then , he has ar@@ ra@@ yed by his role as the only Sultan , the most important minist@@ ries in the country : prime minister , Secretary @-@ chief of the armed forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Secretary of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of sult@@ ans is characterised by the per@@ sever@@ ant efforts of security forces , especially of domestic secrets , including press freedom , limit and human rights , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities related to human rights , as well as activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country like corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , closing and imprisonment three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent paper that has been reported on corruption in O@@ man since its inc@@ eption ( an absolute monarchy ) , until they were banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , said after in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . in this it was deb@@ ated to corruption in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials killed , judge of the Supreme Court in O@@ man to put pressure on raising a judgment in an inheritance . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 , with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ level parties join the hands of the judiciary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , became a member of the editorial committee , issued by the ISS in front of the special department and was arrested by the security forces on his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS awarded the dep@@ uty chief editor @-@ in You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acts as a chief editor to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed at an unlimited period after the information officer had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 forbidden . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the first trial took place in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison @-@ stra@@ ins and ord@@ ained the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned because of dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of an audience and found it guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three year @-@ year prison officers and money stra@@ ins in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year professional work offered against the two journalists . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a cash sentence in height of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after making use of the material for the distribution of material that could pose a risk to public order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit was fixed at the height of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and it was released already on 22 August 2016 before the Jud@@ gment . &quot;
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ als Court spoke openly Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing held on 26 December 2016 , distributed Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i sentenced to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after the prison sentence in masks . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he was mixed up in prison sentence .
the Ap@@ pe@@ als also highlighted the resolution of the Information Ministry to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper clearly sees attacks by the om@@ an@@ ical government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the information officer sent a statement with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; has been extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information officer personally signed another statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; has been extended by three additional months , and thus giving the Minister a further time to decision on the decision of the appeal , the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
&quot; the continual closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in O@@ man , in recent times the press freedom has been in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; other violations include the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to adjust its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities will still not be prepared to make an end the extensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and unconditional release ;
2 . a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to create their journalists will be able to do so ;
to protect the freedom of the press in the country and to protect the freedom of the press
&quot; in all circumstances , to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man can be un@@ divided against their legitimate human rights , and without fear of compensation , including judicial ships . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf Region and the right to gather peaceful and support them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , figure is done with its consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the demand on site supporting medical research , there are two reasons : to be missing in the offer of global health system many drugs and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have serious impact in the poorest countries of Africa as elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical firms are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , when building their own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Sam@@ bia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself addressed the HIV virus that decided to go back home to support the sam@@ pl@@ ating health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ er discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ i national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I start a research programme for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think are the important current science themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there are no basic research here . we only put solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always stay the recipient , instead of being holding ourselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get are often not well applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the United States and Europe .
the projects are funded differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back to come here , as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is research infrastructure ?
which barriers are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries , it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; R@@ W : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ? &quot;
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; the sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe us the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa from western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; R@@ W : often there are the limited speed to do things , and the resulting access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines take only accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from USA to India : how to change global food production by the US until India : how to change global food production
&quot; this entry by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental issues worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company has 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant which is cultivated and consumed by NASA @-@ A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; almost 20 years of work , Mor@@ tons of work was done only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sal@@ ami he can get , limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use them for their purpose . &quot;
&quot; patents are not only for single varieties , but also for certain properties such as res@@ ili@@ ence to diseases , a special red or green tone or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the last few years , more and more such patents have been registered in more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ els . due to this trends , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as an im@@ passion@@ ed representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mor@@ ton is still salad , but he now needs longer because his work is ever more complicated by ever more limitations . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if lying in a river a rock bro@@ ck , around whom I have to pump . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding of tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that this patents go far at Sal@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand up court , no one can breed for a new sal@@ ute , because all the features are patented and tried to breed those features that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as the intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .

it is no coincidence that this name rather sounds as if the movement originate from the IT @-@ area and not from the area of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright software . &quot;
she was called into life to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and thus permanently usable for plant bree@@ ders .
&quot; in the context of the initiative , shortly Os@@ si is called , US @-@ bree@@ ders can commit themselves to freely use the seed of them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders only permit others who breed their seeds , to breed , and not immediately utter@@ ing - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ente or prescribed . &quot;
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
prospects for prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Os@@ si @-@ Vor@@ werk , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed plays him according to a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try not to util@@ ise the latter or only little by breed seed with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ n , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , who , in August or September 2016 , we need to know how it is used on farm markets , should also know that the way it is bred based on farms . &quot;
nutri@@ tious without seed @-@ sovereign is not possible .
members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative are committed to providing others their seeds at the disposal . thus you are to be patent in contrast to seeds and plant characteristics .

&quot; Os@@ si @-@ Sup@@ por@@ ters argue that the future of food supplies is at risk , since the available gene pool due to the increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted to shr@@ ink . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD &apos;s work with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . it found that about one third of all the cartridge features are protected as intellectual property , making it available for plant bree@@ ders either at all or only . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggests that mass@@ y @-@ built plants such as wheat in the greatest style are patented as a salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are so bred that they are targeted targeted features - from such , by which their taste or colour increases up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and threats such as ver@@ min or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of pat@@ ties on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders are increasing by ever more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before , since changing conditions are worse forec@@ asted by climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaker Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to indicates that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States , the company has committed to maintaining the genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not contradi@@ cts that intellectual property other bree@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ ties innov@@ ate . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow , once the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; often , these instructions can help others to get to the same result with another method . &quot;
&quot; such protection im@@ pe@@ des innovations not , but encourages them to be made available to the public with more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees the different : 20 years to wait , until a patent has been dra@@ fted , certainly not innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for so long , to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have lost the struggle already . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general public and remain to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ oton@@ ous incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible to make us impossible if we continue to use the best and the latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton had to be pat@@ ched by the concept in itself , plant @-@ characteristics : &quot; we are not really creating the characteristics themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants consist of themselves and as bree@@ ders , we ultimately have no idea how the plants do it . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state of Oregon and Os@@ si Member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; who is a sor@@ cer@@ ous breed , also respects his own values into it . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with big cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ al are needed for their cultivation of her@@ bic@@ ide by growing the concept of agriculture .
my concept is precisely tailored . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents have to survive ; either they just sit down the patent or they hold it too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ ders Frank Mor@@ ton is searching for in his stalli@@ on Sal@@ ate .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the A@@ void of Plant @-@ based innovative would : &quot; &quot; it looks like being with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that pat@@ rol . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years themselves , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent you are 20 years before competition , what makes it really beautiful . &quot;
&quot; although the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept grew quickly but quickly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the centre for sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , an open @-@ source &quot; seed plant . &quot; to preserve the seed plant and helps them to breed new varieties , which meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si @-@ obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , not just one to one in Europe or other parts of the world can be taken over . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent application , patents on conventional plants . &quot;
&quot; a statement is still not a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States , to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems , that the organization is currently an international alliance for &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official start signal . &quot;
&quot; merger of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group to ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Es@@ sens - a Verb@@ und from the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published . in it represents that farmers have the possibility to exchange and improve the seed policies to ensure a stable supply of foods . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphasises the importance of diverse , local supply and seeds for sustainable food safety systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that it will soon become more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has especially respect where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to keep the people clear that even more behind their food is . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of z@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend around the 5th of August , the Egyptian government has reported the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents the human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports over them . &quot;
&quot; August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where it cri@@ tici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and spoke to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic network for Human Rights Information Att@@ are@@ - despite this attack and the Constitution by the authorities , who are actually defending their objective to aband@@ on freedom of freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , as it has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirm that all technical possibilities had been exhausted , to overcome the blocking and not to im@@ itate them . we insist on our task to continue . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first dra@@ ined website of an human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities block more than two months of 21 websites , the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and from Qatar to Qatar . &quot;
# Egypt : first human rights organisation of the wave of woven sper@@ ms to the victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources of human rights in Arab language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ D@@ S@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no access to Egypt &apos;s blog and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada receives his blog for the distribution of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles , which he does not write in Egypt with an accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog which he entered , to deal with the c@@ ens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ ggers , the provider where also Zi@@ adas blog is located , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo calendar , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity when he was arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , as he reported about the student protests , and recorded a video as the police force physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the blocking through the government and reflect what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; however , to block blogs are very old , however , has in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs might not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It succeeded to give me the feeling of a reward management ; a arrest , a su@@ cking murder , un@@ loading of the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They have proven that I did not have nothing in vain . in other words , my words have influence even if only to a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to items of items to get the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
&quot; however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave are going to end the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ esis and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) sper@@ r@@ alled Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . these took technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented also the lock@@ out of vendors , by changing dormit@@ ories and private surfing was possible , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 of June we were noted , such as the blocking of websites that offer V@@ PN@@ s . &quot;
such practice points to the intention of the government to block the content and to filter information to the Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation becomes additional , in addition , that the c@@ ens@@ ur@@ ches will be met behind closed doors , thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis that they can pre@@ ach the court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
&quot; the Brazilian army was deployed in the Fav@@ elas in N@@ iter@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; day after day newspapers show newspapers in Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard motives . &quot;
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school was shot , &quot; &quot; every second day is a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe smo@@ kes disp@@ ens@@ ary disp@@ ens@@ ary with military weapons &quot; , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ waves to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio has reached the highest stand for 10 years . &quot;
&quot; the Brazilian government Global Justice even proclaimed the United Nations , interven@@ e . &quot;
reports as these are all@@ y@@ daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio famous newspaper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sex inter@@ rup@@ tions , etc . all , which happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what is just happening in Rio in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists will not close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the editor , that this decision was not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure . &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war bri@@ tish in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video an journ@@ alist of the newspaper declares that , according to the Institute for Intern@@ al Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , there are criminal organisations to be controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes on : &quot;
&quot; it is aware that a war @-@ off course , if it is distor@@ ted , even though it may be used , atro@@ cities of the police that only sho@@ ots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partner . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; more than they benefit ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l argu@@ ed the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira about fighting violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and could complic@@ ate it to account responsibilities in the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - like extra in the analysis of military income in Rio themselves - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ made negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember , the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital . &quot;

&quot; to describe Rio de Janeiro in the &quot; The non @-@ violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the State of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; as we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ as per federal state , Rio in place is located 16 &quot; , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; one of the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , stresses the largest media company South America , such as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state . &quot;
&quot; at this safety policy , the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a Fav@@ ela to capture a Fav@@ ela and permanently out@@ ward one unit . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP has actually been protected following several reports on sli@@ ders and repres@@ sions against the poor congreg@@ ations , which actually should protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio are not determined by the Geneva Convention - the criteria for the name &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; this calls for the state to use the means and paths that are typical of war . this is the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civil war is an un@@ discer@@ n@@ able point in the countryside and to the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; and &quot; mixed @-@ out balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her , fact is that the inhabitants of Fav@@ elas continue to suffer from Rio . &quot;
&quot; one week it is now that the police went up the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all these violence , this incident took place : an orch@@ ard died at a result of shots , which fired the police from a helic@@ opter . &quot;

source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal attacks and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime towards loy@@ alist troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organisation P@@ ax and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently generates around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected by the East Gh@@ out@@ a , where a attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians on August 21 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition go out , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre was exer@@ ted by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these have been controlled by re@@ bel regions outside of Damascus among si@@ ege , resulting from residents at local or through tunnel and check@@ points . &quot;
&quot; through years block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat has become in@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large sections of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
you call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ is@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to conventional ones in Syria . however , they are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional value makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the bel@@ ated east Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Direct project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms from fung@@ i because they have high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , talks Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years now , this project has been known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more &quot; to famili@@ arity . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ ine as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to pl@@ anting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of its expected target of approximately 12.@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the fuel scar@@ ce , locally produced fuel are used from plastic , in order to supply generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production of from the regions &quot; &quot; Pil@@ z@@ ily &quot; &quot; before they are super@@ vised their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; apprentic@@ es@@ hof in the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in the east Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people of pilgrims for various reasons &quot; &quot; rup@@ ture the har@@ ness . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ suff@@ iciency ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) to the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are bound to their home .

they demand justice for the victims of the rolls of 2017
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on the 21st of October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for victims of fires , which occurred in the north of Portugal , in the north of Portugal . &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two people died , and about 70 were in@@ ju@@ red by the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires were also registered in the G@@ ali@@ zi@@ en region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires breaks , spread in the north and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , in June , Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande are a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths due to the fires of 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system that monitors the forest @-@ surfaces by satellite recording , are burned alone in Portugal about 500,000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there are only in 4 districts there is no fire .

the cra@@ y@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protest@@ ations from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire control measures by the state .
&quot; the people asked why civil protection was not able to conc@@ ise the extent of the tragedy , as far as possible . &quot;
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al by the Bund der Landwirte by Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were evac@@ u@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dual reports of open roads that were enclosed by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have fallen back in June as the streets were locked very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction permits are inter@@ inter@@ ed with a high level of fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a sof@@ tening proposal to the wal@@ k@@ form that had brought the government following major fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was promoted by the municipalities which saw new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government conducted a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the case to be considered by the applicant , if the applicant has been built on funds to self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; leads JoÃ£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o further . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made attention to that large areas with Eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made of light fl@@ amm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this species ever further spread . &quot;
&quot; to these problems are added that the website of civil defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , served as residents information or sought to contact persons , and was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that supplied the population with information : she used the own civil security data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was founded in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o P@@ ina , in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so expres@@ sing on this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the server followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400,000 users who held the fires , the site counted over half a million user reviews . &quot;

&quot; in one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
two years before was a terrible civil war between the different mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings who had been defeated by the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a land of terror and desp@@ air .
&quot; at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Asia , during the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother was not so said then , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the dawn to break the boy .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the sl@@ ums .

Abdu@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Hez@@ bollah @-@ managed party Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly protection . &quot;
the Taliban sitting ever closer to its hate to the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara passed the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape took A@@ shar@@ k in Pakistan .
for a couple of years he worked in a coh@@ ort . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left by his small salary , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and s@@ acks with mort@@ ar , who were he@@ avier than he himself , to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods . &quot;
&quot; back then as today , life af@@ gh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , reminded of the shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the job@@ site , where we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there was no services there and no heating . we charged N@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we were not awake at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; on the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered boat and str@@ and@@ ed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , just slept through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who distributed twice a day of food in the need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; true it is true that Italy is a sort of second chance for ex@@ pi@@ ed asylum seek@@ ers . it is also true that the conditions prevailing asylum seek@@ ers in the country can be dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special &quot; &quot; centres . &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ imagin@@ able personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers can only be dealt with asylum seek@@ ers , when they officially enter an application for asylum - which can be carried on asylum after the registration of the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; there are people who do not have money for accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
thus erg@@ ing it also A@@ shar@@ k .
but his im@@ min@@ ent li@@ king helped A@@ shar@@ k to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years he had made various works in the Bau@@ ge@@ be , tasted A@@ shar@@ k his whole savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
it was so good that he opened after a while still a second hostel and a mu@@ ff lim@@ iss .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story now is the theme of &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury &quot; &quot; - an Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates about 20,000 Afghanistan live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the path to other European countries .
&quot; in the last few years some of Afghanistan emerged from Afghanistan , including cutting @-@ agencies , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some af@@ gh@@ an restaurants even have been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of its restaurant by Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff for the most part of refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s carte is told by the various af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entre@@ pren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua up the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome also Afghanistan .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ pen@@ s objectives are far beyond Italian ingredients and trade and aim to go back to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I would like to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happy when I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers in the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of the society and have the same possibilities as everyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ atives . &quot; this way , they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entre@@ pren@@ eur was a journey through in@@ security and doubt , but at the end are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; the Egyptian parliament exam@@ ines a legislative draft which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users have to use to use social networks within six months of successful legislation on the web site of the authority , st@@ ating their full name and number . &quot;
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months imprisonment or to the end of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which was advertis@@ ed in the European Parliament , is currently being applied to legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament , and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; May , another member of parliament would be introduced a bill to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the abuse of the President , or of a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian right , the si@@ ege of the President and government institutions is already stra@@ ined . under the legislative proposal there would be such an act with pris@@ ons and money stra@@ ins , as a legal experts at Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be passed , this can mean to three years imprisonment for the off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger already for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested by the Egyptian polic@@ emen as he demonstrated violence against prot@@ esters , which led against the military put@@ sch who had led against the President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just like more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested by the same incident , four years in jail on a jud@@ gement date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postponed to the 20th of May because the pris@@ ons of the human rights groups fail to bring the accused of prison into the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty on the basis of one , so many human rights groups agree to the head@@ count of such an arms collection , illeg@@ ally meeting , murder and murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si Seat lock on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdu@@ ll@@ ah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist are inter@@ rup@@ ed for documents
May Tunisi@@ an authorities six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ de of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was primarily attributed to a regulated action plan by President of the Republic . according to the plan proposed by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused officer officer Am@@ nest@@ y , provided that these all un@@ timely funds have been with@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; the document released on 21 April on the web site of Na@@ wa@@ at , raises a light on how the presidential plans to support the law@@ suit . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia re@@ acted the nam@@ ing of its sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press @-@ dex@@ es which journalists are the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he stood in the district court in Tunis on 09 . May as a witness . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to submit their identification ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the Security Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users need social media in China need to write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with regulations , registration is required to be required to its full name . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st suspected that in the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks , it is still unclear how the authorities apply these rules . &quot;
Chinese @-@ citizens have proposed to enforce these regulations in social media to defend these regulations in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .

&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or failed We@@ chat , register in the state government as &quot; &quot; organizer of the information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law coming from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government guides a list of online services which allows the &quot; publication of the information &quot; , &quot; which allows the government to be responsible for removing content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ n@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia two popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and du@@ ly other services . &quot;

&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication has been closed , the page was closed because it works to &quot; a source of information that works with groups to rede@@ em a political diff@@ use campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is therefore , next to China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
&quot; great Britain can not stop , &quot; &quot; reverse &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; following this week , the Government &apos;s Britain is located in the middle of a targeted consultation with regard to increased monitoring possibilities , the internet service providers would comp@@ el to monitor the communications in real time and keep the back@@ door programs to de@@ cryp@@ ted data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and security services related to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population . &quot;
&quot; despite all , the consultation will be passed on until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be passed on to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
